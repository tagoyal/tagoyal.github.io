The foursome, of Gloucester, completed their mammoth challenge on Monday night with just a couple of hours of sleep. Lea Poole, Dale Poole, Adam Bircher and Luke de Witt Vine played the game Dune, watched by supporters and an online audience. The world record attempt was carried out in aid of Alzheimer's Research UK. The rules of the challenge stated the men were allowed to accumulate five minutes respite for every hour they played. They had to beat the previous world record, held by a team in The Netherlands, which played a board game for 80 hours in January 2017. Guinness World Records stipulated they would need to play for at least five more hours to be considered for a world record. The men's attempt has yet to be ratified. Alzheimer's Research UK was selected to benefit from the challenge as Lea and Dale Poole's father suffers from the condition. Dale Poole said: \"It's a bit of a rollercoaster really. It's very flattering. People have been sending in their support and donations and it's really humbling.\"  The team were not allowed full meals, but just snacks throughout the attempt, which included 79 games in total. \"You can be within one hour quite wide awake and alert, and by sitting down and not having to think for a few seconds, that's it, you're now tired and there's no way of breaking that weird cycle,\" said Lea Poole. The men completed the challenge at 23:00 GMT on Monday but decided to carry on and finish the game they were on, sipping on champagne to celebrate. Mr Burcher said he was \"tired, beyond measure\" but \"really quite satisfied and pleased with how far we've come\".  \"If you'd told me last year I'd be doing something like this I would have called you crazy,\" he added. Mr De Witt Vine said it had been a \"difficult and trying experience but I'm glad we've done it.\" The group have raised almost \u00a31,000 for Alzheimer's UK, as well as a smaller amount for Herefordshire Mind, a mental health charity.", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["t0"], "worst_summary": ["gpt3"]}, {"best_summary": ["t0"], "worst_summary": ["gpt3"]}], "t0": {"text": "Four men have broken the world record for the longest time spent playing a board game."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The article is about four men who have completed a world record by playing a board game continuously for more than 85 hours."}, "brio": {"text": "A team of four men have set a new world record by playing a board game for 90 hours."}}, "1": {"article": "A woman and three men have denied murdering two men who died in a car crash on a dual carriageway.

Lee Butler, 39, suffered massive blood loss after he was knifed in the chest following a drugs deal in Barton, Oxford, the city's crown court heard.  Lewis Brown, 20, of Barton, denies Mr Butler's murder on 8 October 2021.  Prosecutor Charles Ward-Jackson said Mr Brown was a well-known crack cocaine and heroin dealer, but some clients had concerns over his products' purity.  Three people had died in Oxfordshire in September 2021 after taking contaminated heroin, Mr Ward-Jackson said.  He said Mr Brown had inflicted a \"serious and deliberate\" wound on Mr Butler after he accused him of belittling him.  The knife passed through Mr Butler's left lung, missed his heart but pierced his aorta, triggering huge bleeding.  Mr Brown is alleged to have sent text messages to 35 drug users on the morning of 8 October \"advertising\" that he had drugs to sell.  Mr Butler and a friend, also a drug user, met Mr Brown in a park off Bayswater Road in Barton to buy drugs at about 17:45 BST.  But Mr Butler's friend called the emergency services at 17:51 after he was stabbed with what the court heard was a \"hunting-type\" weapon. It has never been recovered.  Mr Ward-Jackson said Mr Brown arrived at the park in a \"bad mood\" and was concerned the pair had been \"bad mouthing\" the purity of his drugs. Mr Brown fled the park after attacking Mr Butler, and took taxi and bus rides across Oxford before arriving at a friend's home in Barton later that evening, the court heard.  He allegedly told his friend there: \"I only stabbed him once. How did he die from that?\"  The police arrived at his friend's home at about 01:00 on 9 October, where Mr Brown ran away from officers before being arrested at about 01:13.

It is about 1% of the 5,535 people who have applied since the programme launched 48 hours earlier. Europe minister James Cleverly said he did not know the exact figures but said numbers would increase \"very quickly\". The Ukrainian ambassador praised the UK effort but urged for the \"maximum\" number of people to be admitted. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"doing everything possible\" to speed up efforts to issue the travel permits. The UK has steadily increased its visa offer to refugees from the Ukraine war, extending it to parents, grandparents and siblings as well as \"immediate family\" and extending the visas to three years. But it has faced criticism that its scheme is less generous than the European Union's, while France accused the UK of a \"lack of humanity\", saying that 150 refugees were turned back at Calais for lacking a visa. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 200,000 Ukrainians would be eligible to travel to the UK as he extended the offer of visas to a wider range of family members.  As of 10:00 GMT on Sunday, the Home Office said 11,750 had begun applications online, while 5,535 had completed them. It added that 2,368 had booked a visa appointment to submit their application and biometric information, while \"around 50\" visas had been granted. Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast the final figure would be \"significantly\" more than the 50 figure being quoted and said while a process was needed the government would make it \"as quick, easy and as fast as possible\". \"We are looking to create something very, very large-scale very, very quickly\" he said. \"Initially it will be slower than we would like but that will pick up.\"  Asked if it was acceptable that about 1% of applications had been granted in the first 48 hours of the scheme, Ms Patel said it was \"the first scheme in the world that's up and running in this short period of time\". \"This is an incredible scheme and we are doing everything possible, surging capacity across every single application centre across the EU,\" she said, adding that staff were being flown into Ukraine's border countries to speed up applications. Ukraine's immediate neighbours have taken in the majority of the 1.5 million people estimated to have fled the war, with more than one million arriving in Poland. Mr Celverly said that while \"all of us would want to throw our arms open and be generous\" there needed to be a process but there was no upper limit on how many Ukrainians could come to the UK via government schemes. \"We want to play our part but of course most Ukrainian refugees are in the countries bordering Ukraine and that's where they want to stay and we are providing humanitarian support for them there as well,\" he said. France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote to Ms Patel on Saturday, saying that 400 Ukrainian refugees had arrived at Calais to cross the Channel, but 150 were sent back and told to obtain UK visas at embassies in Paris or Brussels. Mr Darmanin said the response to people in distress was \"completely unsuitable\" and showed a \"lack of humanity\", calling for the UK to put consular staff at Calais to help Ukrainian refugees cross. But Ms Patel said it was \"wrong to say we are turning people back\" and said the Home Office already had people working in Calais to support Ukrainian families. The Sun reported that Ms Patel was \"investigating legal options\" to create a humanitarian route, which would mean anyone without ties to the UK fleeing the conflict would have the right to come to the UK. However, the BBC understands this referred to the already announced route where refugees can be sponsored by individuals, communities or organisation and Mr Cleverly confirmed that there had been no change to the government's policy over the weekend. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, said that the visa process could be simplified, adding that any issues could be resolved later but right now the \"maximum\" number needed to be admitted. He said any \"bureaucratic nonsense\" should be cleared away, although he said it was necessary to continue security checks.

It happened while Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was attending a peace event in the area. Darren Service, of Ballysillan Road in north Belfast, is charged with preparing terrorist acts, hijacking a van and causing a bomb hoax. Mr Service is accused of transporting two gunmen to the scene of a hijacking. That happened minutes before the alert.  A PSNI detective inspector said the gunmen hijacked a van from a workman in Sydney Street and told him that he would be shot or his family would be injured if he did not listen to them.  He explained that an item was then placed in the van and the victim was ordered to drive it to the Houben Centre on the Crumlin Road, where the Republic of Ireland's minister for foreign affairs was attending a peace event.  The court heard that Mr Service accepted, during police interviews, that he was driving in the area of the hijacking on Friday morning but denied that he was the driver of the car in which the gunmen were being transported. The police said that the defendant presented himself at a police station and officers subsequently searched his home where they found about \u00a3100,000 in cash, two balaclavas, UVF pins, an air pistol, drugs and jewellery. The defendant told police officers that the money was \"savings\". He said the balaclavas were for pigeon hunting and that he had bought the UVF pins at a stall. The police said they believe Mr Service was linked to protests over the Irish Sea border. The PSNI objected to bail saying they feared there could be a risk of an escalation of loyalist protests again the Northern Ireland Protocol and the Irish Sea border. The detective inspector also said police believe the defendant was \"actively involved\" in a terrorist act by driving the gunmen. The police also said they believe Mr Service was present and helped to orchestrate trouble during a protest around Lanark Way last year when a bus was set on fire. When the judge asked if he was charged in connection with that, the senior police officer said: \"No, he has not.\" The court also heard that Mr Service has failed to hand over his mobile phone to investigating officers because it contained information he did not want to share. Police also outlined concerns about security alerts in Warrenpoint and on the Belfast to Dublin train earlier this week, linked to the UVF. A prosecution lawyer said the defendant can only be regarded as \"a trusted member\" of the organisation responsible for last week's incident, which she described as \"a politically motivated attack\". She said this is \"an organised grouping of like-minded individuals\". A defence lawyer said it was being suggested that the defendant was a trusted member of the UVF, yet there was no charge in relation to this.  He also asked why the Lanark Way incident last summer was being brought up now when Mr Service was never even questioned about the incident.  The lawyer said the case against his client was \"conjecture\" and joining the dots.  He said there was nothing to connect him forensically to the incident on 27 March. He said his client was \"a legitimate businessman\" who owned three gyms. The judge refused bail saying there were \"significant suspicions\" about the amount of cash found in the defendant's home.  He also referred to his refusal to hand over his phone as being \"within his own gift\".

In February, officials declared some gender reassignment therapies \"child abuse\" under state law.  Parents allowing them, could lose custody of their children under a directive from the Republican governor. A district judge temporarily halted the plan Friday. Judge Amy Clark Meachum ruled that the directive from Governor Greg Abbott violated the Texas state constitution. As a result, investigations into parents currently under way are to stop, pending a trial into the matter. The Texas attorney general's office filed a notice of intent to overturn Judge Meachum's ruling.   A trial challenging the directive is due to take place in July.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had sued Mr Abbott over the directive he had said was to prevent \"child abuse\". LGBTQ rights advocates say the governor's directive unfairly criminalises transgender children and their families - and that the proposal to investigate them appears politically motivated, as part of Mr Abbott's gubernatorial re-election campaign this year.  The directive had also urged teachers, doctors, and healthcare professionals to report any \"suspected abuse\", or face criminal penalties.  Proponents of the directive say children are too young to make life-altering decisions about their bodies.  However, medical experts in Texas say transgender surgical procedures are performed very rarely if ever on minors in the state. Treatment and therapies mainly consist of hormonal treatment (such as reversible puberty blockers) and social transitioning (such as mental health counselling).  They say that this kind of legislation only seeks to further discriminate and isolate trans youth - a population which already experiences disproportionate rates of suicide.   Judge Meachum's order on Friday would stop nine investigations currently being carried out against families of transgender children, according to the Texas Tribune. Amber Briggle, a Texas mother of a trans teen son, was informed that her family was under investigation in late February. In a statement posted to her blog, Ms Briggle said she felt Texas was \"attempting to rip our family apart because we love our children unconditionally\".  \"When we were notified of the allegations, it was as if the wind had been knocked out of us,\" she wrote. \"Raising a transgender child in Texas has been one long political emergency. It always seemed like this day would come.\"  Dozens of states are considering similar laws targeting trans youth.

The proposed plant near Blandford, Dorset, includes a waste transfer station and household recycling centre. Critics said the development, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), did not match the council's climate change goals. The council said the town's existing waste centre was too small. At a meeting of Dorset Council's strategic planning committee, concerns were raised about the lack of solar panels, rainwater harvesting and public transport provision for the proposed plant at Sunrise business park. There were also worries that trees planted to lessen its visual impact may not survive due to the lack of a watering system, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Committee member David Tooke said the design ran counter to the council's passing of a climate emergency motion in 2019. \"To have buildings designed so they cannot take solar panels is a big oversight\u2026 it is the policy of the council to take climate change into account and design things in line with that. I'm not convinced this is good enough.\" Pimperne Parish Council also objected to the scheme being located in the AONB and criticised road access to and from the 2.7 hectare (6.7 acre)site. Dorset Council had argued that the public benefits of the scheme outweighed adverse impacts on the AONB.

One member of Great North Air Ambulance (GNAA) staff has completed his training to use the suit unassisted and two more are to begin shortly. Once operational, medics will be able to fly up a fell in 90 seconds rather than taking 30 minutes by foot. The use of jet suits in medical emergencies is believed to be a world first. Trials of the futuristic-looking kits started in September 2020 but were halted by the Covid-19 pandemic and difficulties in finding a sponsor to cover the costs. The jet suit consists of two mini engines on each arm and one on the back allowing the pilot to control their movement just by moving their hands.     It produces up to 144kg of thrust so it can ascend quickly, saving valuable time, by \"flying\" close to the land. GNAA operations director Andy Mawson, who has completed the training, said: \"We're still awestruck by it, everyone looks at the wow factor and the fact we are the world's first jet suit paramedics but for us it's about delivering patient care. \"When I started as a paramedic I never thought I'd be working with a helicopter, never mind this.\" Currently it takes the GNAA helicopter 25 to 30 minutes to reach a patient in the Lake District, once the crew has found an area flat enough to land. The charity, which works closely with mountain rescue teams, believes there is a major advantage in the Lakes as the jet suit can be used in poor conditions - such as low visibility and strong winds -  which would pose a challenge to a helicopter. The suits have been proved to be effective in 35mph winds and, according to GNAA data, could be used on 15 to 20 medical cases a week. Paramedics will need to fly with 10 to 15kg of medical kit, including a defibrillator and patient-monitoring devices which are strapped in pouches on the pilot's legs and chest. \"It's a machine attached to your body, you have to find your balance point and we're in a job where we challenge ourselves,\" Mr Mawson added. \"There's a lot of pressure on us to make it work but it has a real purpose to get to people who need urgent medical care. \"It would be lovely to enjoy it but we have a job to do at the end of the day.\" Testing the abilities of the suits on the Lakeland fells is new territory, which the manufacturers, Salisbury-based Gravity Industries, welcome.  \"Our drive for creating the suit came from wanting to challenge what seemed like the impossible,\" inventor Richard Browning said.   \"We're enjoying working in a new sector and helping the front-line workers in clean energy.\" Mr Mawson said: \"During trials we asked walkers what they thought, as the jet suits are loud, you can hear them coming and everyone thought it was unbelievable, they were captivated and their feedback  was so positive. \"Who knows - hopefully not - but maybe one day a paramedic in a jet suit like me, could be helping one of those walkers.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}], "t0": {"text": "A pilot has completed training to use a jet suit to reach patients in the Lake District in minutes instead of hours."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The Great North Air Ambulance is hoping to use jet suits to reach medical emergencies in the Lake District this summer, which would be a world first."}, "brio": {"text": "The world's first jet suit paramedics are set to take to the skies in a bid to save lives."}}, "17": {"article": "The trial of a former Goldman Sachs banker who allegedly siphoned millions of dollars from Malaysia's beleaguered 1MDB sovereign wealth fund has been paused in the US, because of an \"inexcusable\" blunder by prosecutors. Prosecutors admit they did not share more than 15,500 documents with the defence lawyers representing Roger Ng.  These relate to their star witness Tim Leissner, who was Mr Ng's boss.  A judge ruled to halt the proceedings without setting a date for resumption.  On Wednesday, US District Judge Margo Brodie ordered a \"break in the trial\" centred on 1MDB, an investment fund set up by the Malaysian government that lost billions of dollars due to fraudulent activity. She asked defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo to decide how much time he needed to go through the evidence, while adding: \"I will give you as much time as you need\".  Assistant US Attorney Alixandra Smith described the blunder as an \"inexcusable error\". Mr Agnifilo has said he may ask for a mistrial \"depending on what this information is\".  His client Roger Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and violating anti-bribery law. Prosecutors say Mr Ng, who worked for Goldman from 2005 to May 2014, received $35m (\u00a326.1m) in kickbacks for his role in the scheme. If found guilty, Mr Ng faces up to 20 years in jail for a money laundering charge and five years for each of two bribery charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  Meanwhile, Mr Leissner, who is a witness for the prosecution, pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018. He previously headed the bank's South East Asia unit.  Prosecutors believe the two men helped divert billions of dollars from 1MDB.  They say $4.5bn of the money was used as bribes for Malaysian politicians and others, who spent their gains on art, jewellery and property. In court last week, Mr Leissner described Mr Ng as a key banker for 1MDB transactions, in which Goldman helped to raise $6.5bn for the fund through a series of bond deals. He said they were hailed as \"heroes\" within the bank for bringing in the business, which brought Goldman roughly $600m in fees. Investigators subsequently found that the proceeds from the bonds, sold from 2009 to 2014, were largely stolen. As a result Goldman Sachs spent years being investigated by regulators around the world. In 2020, the firm reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB.

Frank Morris investigated convicted terrorist Abdalraouf Abdallah between 2014 and 2016. The Manchester Arena Inquiry heard multiple messages found on his phone were from the bomber Salman Abedi. However, that fact only became known to detectives after the May 2017 arena attack, which killed 22 people. Abedi, 22, also killed himself and injured hundreds more when he detonated a homemade device as people left the venue following a concert. The inquiry heard there were about 1,300 messages between Abdallah and someone called \"Salman\" across a number of weeks in November 2014, but no effort was made to identify the latter person. The messages included references to martyrdom and slurs about non-Muslims. The hearing was told \"Salman\" also sent two \"selfies\" of himself to Abdallah and mentioned his surname, Abedi, from a mobile phone number which was later found to be registered in his real name. Evidence from their communications was used in the trial of Abdallah in 2016 in order to demonstrate the defendant's extremist mindset, but detectives made no attempts to identify \"Salman\". There was also never a referral about \"Salman\" made to an internal counter-terror police intelligence team, which could have made further inquiries. Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked if the messages between the pair should have been the subject of \"intelligence development\". Mr Morris, who was a detective inspector in the North-West counter-terrorism unit, said: \"With hindsight, yes.\" However, he said there was \"nothing extraordinary\" in the exchanges compared to what officers saw in other terrorism investigations. He said none of the individuals officers involved in the investigation had thought to refer the \"Salman\" issue for further development. He also said he was aware of a port stop of the bomber's elder brother Ismail Abedi in September 2015. Ismail Abedi was held at Heathrow airport on his return from honeymoon and his phone was found to contain Islamic State propaganda, material encouraging jihadist violence, and images of his family brandishing weapons in Libya. Mr Morris said that at the time, he delegated consideration of the material to a more junior detective, who decided it did not meet the \"threshold\" for referral to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. John Cooper QC, representing several bereaved families, said a \"subjective decision\" had been made by the relevant detective and on that basis, no further action had been taken. He asked Mr Morris if he had been \"surprised\" by the decision. The former detective said the officer was \"very experienced\", adding that he \"hadn't seen\" the material himself.

Tim Wickens, chair of the N&N's Tyneside Committee, said the organisation is not opposed to new development but will \"rigorously oppose\" proposals for buildings \"that lack empathy with their environment, represent bad design or are not sustainable\".  Siting the tower block at Malmo Quay \"would demonstrate a fundamental lack of synergy with the outstanding regeneration effort that has been thoughtfully applied to the internationally renowned Ouseburn Valley,\" he added. Up to 73 homes are also planned in a set of buildings up to eight storeys high on neighbouring Spillers Quay. The N&N believes that site \"offers considerably greater scope for scale and massing than the much more sensitive Malmo Quay site\". None of the 60 to 70 local residents who attended Tuesday's meeting at the Cycle Hub - which would also be demolished and relocated under the scheme - spoke in support of the development. One objector, Graham Woodford, said the site \"belongs to the whole of Newcastle\" and the issue \"affects everyone in the city and in the North East\".  He described the proposed tower block as \"an eyesore\", adding: \"To me, it looks like a cheese grater.  \"When they show the views from the Tyne Bridge, it stands out like a sore thumb - it overwhelms everything. It is just wrong.\" Other residents described the scheme as \"disastrous\", \"manky\", \"alien to the nature of this place\", and something that would irreversibly change the character of the Ouseburn. Sheila Spencer, an ex-councillor and former chair of the Trust, said PfP-igloo's aim was \"not just to make money\" but also complained the iconic view up the Tyne from the Free Trade Inn was not being adequately protected. Ms Spencer also called the proposals for Spillers Quay \"abysmal\". Alec Hamlin, PfP-igloo's development manager, has previously said the firm had \"the greatest respect and appreciation for this beautiful part of the city\".

A study suggests the world's largest rainforest is losing its ability to bounce back from damage caused by droughts, fires and deforestation. Large swathes could become sparsely forested savannah, which is much less efficient than tropical forest at sucking carbon dioxide from the air. The giant forest traps carbon that would otherwise add to global warming.   But previous studies have shown that parts of the Amazon are now emitting more carbon dioxide than can be absorbed. \"The trees are losing health and could be approaching a tipping point - basically, a mass loss of trees,\" said Dr Chris Boulton of the University of Exeter. The findings, based on three decades of satellite data, show alarming trends in the \"health\" of the Amazon rainforest. There are signs of a loss of resilience in more than 75% of the forest, with trees taking longer to recover from the effects of droughts largely driven by climate change as well as human impacts such as deforestation and fires. A vicious cycle of damage could trigger \"dieback\", the scientists said.  And while it's not clear when that critical point might be reached, the implications for climate change, biodiversity and the local community would be \"devastating\". Once the process begins they predict it could be a matter of decades before a \"significant chunk\" of the Amazon is transformed into savannah - a vastly different ecosystem made up of a mixture of grassland and trees. \"The Amazon stores lots of carbon and all of that would be released into the atmosphere, which would then further contribute to increasing temperatures and have future effects on global mean temperatures,\" Dr Boulton said, adding that stopping deforestation would go some way to addressing the problem. Around a fifth of the rainforest has already been lost, compared to pre-industrial levels, they said. The research was carried out by the University of Exeter, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Technical University of Munich.  \"Deforestation and climate change are likely to be the main drivers of this decline,\" said Prof Niklas Boers of PIK and the Technical University of Munich. Commenting, Dr Bonnie Waring of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment, Imperial College London, said: \"These latest findings are consistent with the accumulating evidence that the twin pressures of climate change and human exploitation of tropical forests are endangering the world's largest rainforest, which is home to one out of every 10 species known to science.\" The findings, based on satellite data from 1991 to 2016, are published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries.  But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived.  It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments.  More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank.  The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they \"are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally\". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war.  Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles.  Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift.  There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid.  There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet.  Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly.  The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions.  It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is to work with the Home Office in the Channel under Operation Isotrope. However, the Defence Committee said it would take \"scarce resources\" from the MoD, which is already \"overstretched\". A government spokeswoman said no ships used would have \"any possible role\" in a UK response to the war in Ukraine. Vice-Chair of the committee John Spellar said: \"The policy announcement left much to be desired.  \"Squabbling between the Great Offices of State severely undermines public confidence in government.\" The report stated the MoD budget is \"already inadequate\" and called on the government to declare which existing Royal Navy commitments should be \"sacrificed\" to divert resources to Operation Isotrope. Mr Spellar said the government had been \"unwilling\" to answer such questions from the committee. The report found an \"overall lack of clarity from the government\" on the operation, and questioned whether announcing the policy before agreeing the detail was a move \"borne of desperation\".   \"Calling in the Navy is not a quick fix to a sticky issue\", Mr Spellar said. Reputationally, the MoD has \"little to gain and much to lose\" in its involvement with Operation Isotrope, he added. The committee also agreed the operation could not be \"open-ended\" and the government should announce a definitive end date and handover back to the Border Force.  The report comes after a former naval officer warned MPs that Navy patrols would fuel Channel crossings. Those concerns were reiterated in the report, which stated the Navy is legally unable to turn boats around, and would become a \"taxi service\" for migrants crossing the Channel.

Cheshire Fire Service sent six fire engines to the blaze at Neston after it started just before 18:30 GMT on Saturday. The fire covered about 1 sq km (0.4 sq miles) and was \"mainly extinguished\" by midnight, the fire service said. Cheshire Police said they were keen to speak to a group of teenagers regarding the fire. They said three boys and a girl, aged between 14 and 15, were seen in the area when the blaze began. They said the girl had long dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and two boys were wearing dark jackets, while the third boy was wearing a light blue jacket and trousers. A police spokeswoman said investigators believed the fire was caused deliberately and they were treating it as arson. Eyewitness Peter Guy, 43, who was visiting nearby Parkgate on a day trip, said he had just finished having fish and chips when he noticed the fire. He said there was no explosion, but the fire took hold rapidly, creating a \"wall of flames\" across the marshland. \"It started off looking like a regular bonfire and then I noticed the fire getting closer to us,\" he said. \"There were so many people there enjoying the beautiful sunset. I've never seen anything like it. It was like the sky was on fire.\" On Saturday evening, the fire service said there were two areas of fire spreading around the marshland, a site of special scientific interest.  Fire breaks were put in place to protect nearby properties. By 22:00 GMT the huge flames had died down along with the crowds, which earlier lined the Parkgate front, said the BBC's Jon Ironmonger who was at the scene. Hundreds of pubgoers and residents spilled onto the seawall to see the fire, which surged across marshland in the Dee estuary. Cheshire Police said it had received a report about a man being attacked while trying to disperse spectators. A spokeswoman said he sustained a minor injury to his lip.  By midnight, all but one fire engine had been withdrawn to safety as the tide came in, with the fire mainly extinguished. By 07:00 on Sunday, crews confirmed the fire was out by carrying out a sweep of the area with a thermal imaging camera. A spokeswoman for RSPB, which owns the nature reserve, said: \"We're shocked and saddened by the fire that has devastated the Neston Reedbed part of our reserve.\" She said marsh harriers were \"beginning to build their nests on the marshland which has sadly been lost to fire\". The reserve hosts wildlife, including bearded tits, Cetti's warblers and bittern.  The RSPB said the scale of the damage was being assessed and thanked the emergency services for their response. Chris Tynan, from RSPB Liverpool, added that the Dee estuary was \"internationally important\" and \"one of the top 10 river estuaries in the UK\". \"There's a huge numbers of birds that come in there because it's got lots of food, it's got lots of habitat.

More than 60 years later, she found the forgotten bank book while tidying her house in the city's Stockbridge area. She took it along to her bank, and found that the \u00a32.50 she had deposited was now worth \u00a3250 - and that the money was still there for her to collect. Carol is urging others to reclaim money from old accounts. Where an account has not been used for 15 years, the UK's banks and building societies send the money to the Reclaim Fund. It has received more than \u00a31.4bn from dormant accounts, and only \u00a3100,000 has been reclaimed. Carol, who is now 74, lived in Manilla in the Philippines when she was young. Every three years, she would travel home to Edinburgh with her mother, Anna Paton, and brother, Gerard. They would spend a year at their granny's house in Northumberland Street, Stockbridge. Her father, James Paton, would join them for part of the year. During one of these trips, when she was aged six, her grandmother, Helen Ivory, would take them to deposit pocket money in the Trustee Savings Bank - which later became TSB. Carol paid in a shilling - now worth five pence - every week. \"I remember the big shiny wooden counter at the bank and granny introducing us to the teller,\" she said. \"He would fill in the book by hand and then we would take our books back to granny's again. \"It was a very grown up thing to do and on the way home she would stop in the bakers to buy us frosted cakes for our afternoon tea. We would never eat them in the street, we wouldn't even think of that, we would wait for the afternoon tea.\" Carol was given the bank book when her grandmother died, aged 80, in 1969. It was forgotten about until it was rediscovered - along with two other bank books - while she was tidying up in her house. The other books date back to the 1980s. The mother-of-four told BBC Scotland: \"I thought I would try one. \"I was really pleased and thanked my grandmother, under my breath, when they told me I had \u00a3250. \"They said it had continued to gain interest all that time. I'm now going to see how much has accrued in the other two now, it's very exciting.\" A total of 35 banks and building societies in the UK are signed up to the Reclaim Fund, which was launched in 2011. This not-for-profit arms length government body has given \u00a3800m to charity, and has kept \u00a3600m to cover customers reclaiming their money. Chief executive Adrian Smith said the money was donated to charities dealing with social investment, children and financial inclusion. He added: \"It is very important for people to know their money is never lost, they can always get it back. \"The money goes back to accounts that are 50, 60, 70 years old - they go back as far as records go back. \"We look after the money, which we give to charity, but we always must have enough to meet claims. I would always encourage anyone who thinks they have a lost account to apply.\" Anyone who thinks they have a lost account can fill out a form online. You do not need the original bank book to reclaim money if you have the address you were living in and the name of the bank.

On Monday, West Northamptonshire Council deferred a vote on accepting an offer from Northampton Town, or a rival bid, for land next to Sixfields. The authority has now said its cabinet will make a final decision at a meeting on 8 March. Cabinet member for finance, Malcolm Longley, said: \"We believe we have now resolved any outstanding issues.\" The East Stand was supposed to be refurbished using a \u00a310.25m loan from Northampton Borough Council, but work stalled in 2014 after contractors went unpaid. The borough authority has since been replaced by West Northamptonshire Council as part of a reorganisation of local government in the county. The Conservative-run council is currently considering two separate bids for land around Sixfields, which does not include the stadium. One from real estate company Cilldara is for \u00a32.05m. The other comes from County Developments (Northampton) Limited (CDNL), a company owned by the football club's chairman Kelvin Thomas and his business partner David Bower. That bid comes with a promise to complete the East Stand. It originally came in at \u00a3890,000, but was this week increased to match the Cilldara bid. At Monday's cabinet meeting, councillors decided to defer a decision on the deal to look at further aspects of each offer. Mr Longley said both bids have been given \"careful consideration and we believe we have now resolved any outstanding issues\". \"There is no need to delay this any further, so we have agreed to bring a report to our cabinet meeting on 8 March,\" he said.

He said the town of Borodyanka may have suffered more than others. Horrific images of bodies in streets in towns like Bucha have generated shock and condemnation worldwide. Ukrainian intelligence officials said Russian units based in the region would be sent back to eastern Ukraine. The 64th motorised rifle brigade - which they allege committed atrocities in Bucha - would return to the conflict within weeks, probably to the Kharkiv area, they said. Russia denies killing civilians, and without evidence says Ukraine staged the scenes. The Ukrainian government started a war crimes investigation after it said the bodies of 410 civilians had been found in areas around Kyiv.  Some were discovered in mass graves while others had their hands tied and had apparently been shot at close range. Officials in Kyiv also accused Russian forces of killing a village head, her husband and her son in the village of Motyzhyn for aiding Ukrainian troops in the area. There are also reports of at least three apparently tortured bodies in the town of Konotop in another northern region, Sumy. The images from Bucha prompted US President Joe Biden to call for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes. His intervention came as new satellite photos by the earth observation company Maxar showing bodies lining Bucha's streets during its occupation by Russian forces were published. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference in Warsaw on Monday that the killings were the \"tip of the iceberg\" and demanded more severe sanctions against Russia. In a BBC interview, he cited the desperate situation in the southern town of Mariupol, which has been under Russian bombardment for weeks. \"What we've seen in recent weeks is that Russia is much worse than Isis [the Islamic State group] when it comes to its atrocities and massacres,\" he said. In his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Mr Zelensky said things were done throughout the region north of Kyiv that people had not seen since the Nazi occupation. \"There is already information that the number of victims may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,\" he said. Mr Zelensky is due to speak to the United Nations Security Council later on Tuesday, where he is expected to offer more evidence of atrocities. Several Western nations have expelled Russian diplomats in response to the discovery of the atrocities, and new sanctions against Russia are being discussed. Italy announced on Tuesday it was expelling 30 Russian officials, Denmark 15 and Sweden three. Germany and France announced similar measures on Monday, and Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador. Russia has vowed to retaliate. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell will travel to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president later in the week, Ms von der Leyen's spokesman said. But Moscow's ambassador to the UN said Russia would present \"empirical evidence\" to the UN Security Council demonstrating that Western statements on events at Bucha were lies.

MP Sir Christopher Chope accused the Met Police of an \"abuse of power\", amid concerns senior civil servant Sue Gray will leave out crucial findings. Doubts over how complete the report will be came after the Met asked her to make \"minimal reference\" to events they are looking at. A version of the report is yet to be handed to Downing Street. While no exact timeframe for the report's submission has been given, Ms Gray is expected to submit her report before the Met finishes its investigations. The force is investigating alleged parties and gatherings at Downing Street and other locations in Whitehall during coronavirus restrictions, and has received evidence from Ms Gray's team. No 10 has pledged to publish Ms Gray's report \"as they receive it\". Sir Christopher, the Conservative MP for Christchurch, accused the police of interfering with Ms Gray's investigation. \"They're not right [to ask for changes] this is not sub judice,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, referring to active legal proceedings that prohibit public discussion.  \"If they had brought charges about individuals... then it would obviously be sub judice. \"That's why I think this is an abuse of power by the Metropolitan Police.\" Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who has been critical of the prime minister's handling of the issue, also warned that any redacted or watered down report would not \"go down well with colleagues\" and the public wanted to see the government was on the \"road to change\". Another Tory MP Adam Holloway, who said he backs Boris Johnson but is willing to \"run with\" Ms Gray's findings, told Today: \"If I was Boris I would be really quite desperate for the truth to get out.\" It followed calls from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party for the report to be published without omissions. Lord Morris of Aberavon, a former attorney general under ex-Labour PM Tony Blair, said he was dismayed with the police, telling the BBC: \"Any prejudice which might result in fines would be a disproportionate concern.\" But criminal barrister Matthew Scott, from Pump Court Chambers, said: \"Given that they are investigating possible criminal offences I think they are absolutely right to do what they have done and ask. \"They have no power to enforce, but they can ask and they have done, that the relevant parts of the report not be made public before they have completed their inquiry.\" In a statement on Friday night, the Met defended its request for the Cabinet Office to minimise reference to certain events in Ms Gray's report as being fair to those subject to investigation. Commander Catherine Roper, who leads the Met's Central Specialist Crime Command, added: \"This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded, and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events.  \"We intend to complete our investigations promptly, fairly and proportionately. \"We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team.\" Commander Roper said the offences under investigation would normally be dealt with by fixed penalty notice.  During the pandemic, fixed penalty notices ordered people to either pay a penalty - between \u00a3200 and \u00a310,000 - or opt to face a criminal prosecution, usually at magistrate's court, for alleged breaches of Covid regulations. Mr Johnson has said he welcomes the Met investigation and that it will \"give the public the clarity it needs\" over the allegations. His spokesman said the prime minister did not believe he had broken the law. At least 13 separate events are reported to have taken place at Downing Street or other buildings in Westminster when London, or the UK, were under tough restrictions. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat has become the first MP to publicly say he would consider running for Tory leader if a contest was triggered.

However, the trust said the hospital had \"continued to deliver safe and effective care\" for patients. Absences due to Covid-19 and non-Covid-related reasons is affecting about one in 10 of all staff across the five health trusts, according to the latest figures. The Royal College of Midwives director in Northern Ireland, Karen Murray, said Covid had exposed issues around the number of midwifery staff that are available. \"I think this has been the worst it has been; I think it has been that perfect storm. We recognised and we were raising issues about workforce before Covid,\" she said. \"Whilst our central services are being maintained and safety is being maintained, what we are seeing are things around the periphery of maternity services, that are now being stood down. \"Things like home births, for example, that we are unable to facilitate because we don't have enough midwives available.\" While some maternity services have been affected by the spread of Covid-19, Ms Murray said staffing levels are beginning to stabilise. \"We still consider ourselves to have issues around workforce but the situation is improving and if that improvement is maintained, I think we will get through this current situation.\" BBC News NI also asked the Belfast Trust about concerns that two midwives had, on occasion, been left to care for 20 babies and their mothers in postnatal wards at the hospital. In response, the trust said \"on a small number of shifts two registered midwives, along with midwifery support workers and midwifery students have cared for multiple postnatal patients\". A spokesperson added that the \"midwifery team is comprised of highly-skilled and experienced staff\" and that \"where a gap in staffing has been found, our team has quickly identified a solution to ensure appropriate\" staffing levels.

The estimated cost of the project has also risen substantially to about \u00a3230m according to figures previously released by the minister in November 2021. She said \u00a346m had already been spent and a further \u00a3184m was required to complete the campus, meet running costs and provide support to the six schools for shared curriculum activities. It had been originally estimated to cost \u00a3168m, according to the Northern Ireland Audit Office. The campus is meant to be paid for using money from the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement. Strule is the biggest school-building project ever in Northern Ireland but Arvalee Special School, which opened in 2016, is the only one of six schools to be built so far.

Moscow said it was a \"destructive\" step which heightened tension and reduced the scope for a political solution.   The Pentagon said 2,000 US troops would be sent from North Carolina to Poland and Germany, and a further 1,000 already in Germany would go to Romania. Russia has some 100,000 troops near Ukraine. It denies planning to invade. The tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement the Minsk agreement - an international deal to restore peace to the east, where Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory and at least 14,000 people have been killed since 2014. The US and the Western military alliance Nato question the continued build up of Russian forces near Ukraine.  On Thursday Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had seen a \"significant movement\" of roughly 30,000 Russian troops to Belarus in the last few days - the biggest deployment to the country since the end of the Cold War.  Russia says the troops are there for joint military drills.  Ukraine, meanwhile, has sought to dampen talks of conflict. Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Thursday the number of ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine had dropped, and that there have been no combat losses for three weeks.  In a separate development, Russia announced that it was closing the Moscow bureau of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and revoking accreditations for its staff. This comes a day after Germany banned Russian state TV network RT on the grounds that it did not have a legitimate broadcasting permit.  Responding to US President Joe Biden's decision to deploy extra troops to Europe this week, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said it was a \"destructive\" and an \"unjustified\" step. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Grushko added that it would \"delight\" the Ukrainian authorities, who would continue sabotaging the Minsk agreement \"with impunity\". On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged the US to \"stop escalating tensions\" in Europe, saying the new troop deployment worsened the situation and adding that Russian concerns about Nato's eastward expansion are \"absolutely justified\". The Pentagon has said the US troops being deployed would not fight in Ukraine - but would ensure the defence of Washington's allies. Their deployment is in addition to the 8,500 troops the Pentagon put on alert last month to be ready to deploy to Europe if needed. \"It's important that we send a strong signal to Mr Putin and, frankly, to the world that Nato matters to the United States and it matters to our allies,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. But on the question of alleged invasion plans by Mr Putin, he said: \"We still don't believe he's made a decision to further invade Ukraine.\" He also said a US proposal \"leaked to a European news outlet\" was genuine. He appeared to be referring to a story in Spain's El Pa\u00eds newspaper about a US offer of talks with Russia in exchange for reducing tensions over Ukraine. The US proposals reportedly include: The documents said the US would discuss all issues that affect European security with its allies. These are combat-ready troops but they are not expected to be fighting Russian soldiers - if they were the deployment would be much bigger. After all Moscow is not seen to be directly threatening Poland and Romania.  Joe Biden is trying to show this resolve without undermining chances of a diplomatic solution. He is not sending a lot of troops, and notably, none to the Baltic states right on Russia's doorstep.  But these deployments are the most concrete sign that the current crisis is broader than Ukraine, that it's over the post-Cold War security infrastructure in Europe. Rivalry between Russia and the US, which still possess the world's biggest nuclear arsenals, dates back to the Cold War (1947-89). Ukraine was then a crucial part of the communist Soviet Union, second only to Russia. Mr Putin said the US had ignored Moscow's concerns in its response to Russian demands for legally binding security guarantees, including a block on the Nato alliance's further expansion to the east. Romania, which is hosting some of the newly deployed US troops, is home to a US-built Aegis land-based missile defence station, which Russia has described as a security threat since it opened in 2016.", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}], "t0": {"text": "Russia has denounced as \"unjustified\" a US decision to send 3,000 troops to Europe, amid tensions over Ukraine."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The US is sending extra troops to Europe to support its allies amid continuing fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Russia has condemned as a \"destructive\" step."}, "brio": {"text": "Tensions between Russia and the US are at their highest since the Cold War."}}, "52": {"article": "A pilot project funded by the Home Office has found it is more humane and less expensive to support asylum seekers in the community rather than in detention centres. Refugee charity, Action Foundation, supported 20 women in a community setting in Newcastle. It found the women experienced more stability and better health. Most had previously been detained in Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre. In November 2021, a new female-only Immigration Removal Centre opened near Consett in County Durham to house 80 women. The Derwentside centre has attracted criticism from various campaign groups including Durham People's Assembly, Abolish Detention and No To Hassockfield, which says the women housed there should be allowed to live in the community.   Agnes Tanoh, a former detainee at Yarl's Wood and now a campaigner against the Derwentside centre, said: \"I think the best way is to put people in the community, to welcome people who are in need, who have fled persecution.\"  Action Foundation chief executive Duncan McAuley said the results of the project \"clearly demonstrated that these women would be better served in a community setting\". The evaluation also found the cost of keeping people in the community could be less than half the cost per participant per night than holding an individual in detention. Mr McAuley said: \"While we recognise the need for some capacity in Immigration Removal Centres, it is shocking to see the Home Office investing millions of pounds in a new facility on our doorstep at Derwentside.  \"Instead, we would love to see taxpayers' money invested in alternatives, avoiding the huge personal cost to the individuals themselves. \"Why spend millions of pounds building and running a centre 15 miles down the road when we've demonstrated a cheaper, more humane alternative based in local communities?\" Owen Temple from No To Hassockfield said: \"I think it demonstrates what civilised countries already know that you don't need to lock people up to run an effective immigration system to be far more humane and save money so I can see no justification for it, the only thing one can think that drives it is politics.\" Derwentside also holds women who do not have legal status to remain in the UK but are appealing against the decision, and Action Foundation is calling for alternatives to detention for them. The Home Office said detentions were taken on a case-by-case basis and should be \"for the shortest period necessary\".  A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Derwentside IRC will accommodate those who have been to found to have no right to remain in the UK and foreign national offenders while we prepare to remove them. \"Through our New Plan for Immigration we are fixing the broken asylum and immigration system to make it firm on those who seek to abuse it and fair on those most in need of our support.\" The Refugee and Migrant Advisory Service is also carrying out a pilot project for the Home Office supporting both men and women in the community which will run until June.

City councillors backed a request by drivers which would see increases by that amount for hackney carriages. The proposal will now go out for public consultation and if supported, the council estimates the new fares could be in place by June.  Haris Saleem, from Worcester Taxi Drivers Association, said a rise was desperately needed. Drivers have been demanding an increase, with higher costs and fees, fuel and cost of living increases and the Covid-19 pandemic cited as reasons. The city council's licensing and environment health committee backed the request by Worcester Taxi Association for a 20% rise at a meeting in the Guildhall on Thursday, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.  The increase in fares sees the initial cost of flagging a cab rising by 19% to \u00a34.30, with a one-mile journey costing \u00a35 and a two-mile journey going up to \u00a37. Special fares for late-night and bank holiday trips would be \u00a35.50 initially. A 20% increase in cab fares draws a parallel with changes in the price of fuel, with the average cost of petrol and diesel climbing by between 23% and 24% since 2017, according to the AA, when the last fare rise was introduced in Worcester. Mr Saleem stated: \"Oil prices are going up and up every day and we don't know when they are going to stop and I think it is time to look after the trade. \"We proposed, with a consultation from the trade and taxi base owners, what I think is a reasonable increase which considers the trade and the customers as well.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["t0"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["t0", "brio", "gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["t0"], "worst_summary": ["gpt3"]}], "t0": {"text": "Proposals to increase taxi fares by 20% in Worcester have been backed by the council."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The city council's licensing and environment health committee backed the request by Worcester Taxi Association for a 20% rise in fares at a meeting, which would see the initial cost of flagging a cab rising by 19% to \u00a34.30."}, "brio": {"text": "Cab fares are set to rise by up to 20% in a West Midlands city."}}, "55": {"article": "Members of a wheelchair basketball team say they are devastated after thieves stole a dozen sports wheelchairs used to teach newcomers to the sport.

That is according to a just-published letter from the department to schools. Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland ceased to be legally binding on Tuesday, including the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces. The measures are now guidance rather than a legal regulation. However, the Covid-19 guidance from the DE to schools was always just that - guidance - rather than law. That guidance, which has been in operation since August 2021, recommends that post-primary pupils wear a face covering in classrooms, school corridors and other areas like toilets. It is also mandatory for all post-primary pupils to wear a face covering on all public and school transport. Primary pupils do not have to wear a face covering in school but they are encouraged to wear one on school transport. The department's letter said that guidance to schools was \"not impacted\" by the end of legal Covid-19 restrictions in wider society and \"remains unchanged\". \"The position on face coverings, based on public health advice, remains that it is strongly recommended that post-primary pupils wear a face covering at all times when inside school buildings, including classrooms, corridors and confined communal spaces such as toilet areas,\" the DE letter said. In Scotland pupils do not have to wear face coverings in classrooms from 28 February and they do not have to be worn in schools in England. \"You will be aware that by 28 February other UK jurisdictions will have eased their requirements for post-primary pupils to wear face coverings in schools,\" the DE letter continued. \"While our case numbers are still high, they are moving in the right direction, and the minister wishes to be in a similar position here as soon as possible. \"To ensure that the removal of face coverings from guidance is not delayed, the department will continue to actively engage with health colleagues to seek their most up to date advice, to inform the minister's decision on this issue.\" The department also said teachers and unions would be consulted before the guidance on face coverings changed.

The victim, not named for legal reasons, was admitted to the unit in Bury St Edmunds after an overdose.

Offering housing in exchange for sexual favours is already against the law. But there has only been one prosecution under current legislation, despite claims the practice is on the rise.

Minister for Safeguarding Rachel Maclean said the bill will \"capture user-to-user sites, where the majority of 'sex for rent' advertising takes place\".   A list of offences to be made a priority in the legislation, published earlier this month, includes \"controlling, causing or inciting prostitution for gain\".  Sex for rent will be further tackled in the bill by placing \"a duty on certain companies to take action in respect to 'content that is harmful to adults'\", Maclean says, in a written answer to a question from Labour MP Barry Sheerman.  A BBC investigation in 2017 found that young, vulnerable people were being targeted by classified ads offering sex for rent on websites like Craigslist.  One student who had fled an abusive home and had nowhere to live, said she felt she had no other option but to agree to the arrangement.  In response to that investigation, then-Justice Secretary David Lidington said \"sex for rent\" deals were already a criminal offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

It was initially thought 4,000 hectares of woodland had been affected but that has now been revised to 8,000 hectares or about 16 million trees. Forest Research said improved computer modelling, updated mapping and data from owners had increased its figures. Storm Arwen struck in late November causing significant damage particularly in north-eastern and southern Scotland. Industry bodies Scottish Forestry and Confor quickly brought groups together to start the task of managing the recovery operation. It has now emerged that the scale of the work is even greater than first thought. Doug Howieson, Scottish Forestry's head of operational delivery, said: \"The winter storms have put us under a lot of pressure but we've been up to the challenge. \"Staff have worked tirelessly with the industry on managing the aftermath and have put in a heroic shift. \"Felling permission applications, which are needed for windblown trees, are starting to slow down now which is a good indication that we are past the initial emergency phase of this work.\" Forestry and Land Scotland's (FLS) team is working with contractors to deal with the significant levels of storm damage in the national forests it manages. Although some locations are likely to remain affected for months, it said it was beginning to open up recreational access. Environment Minister Mairi McAllan praised the ongoing efforts to address the impact of the storm four months after it struck. \"Although it now seems a long time ago, the effects of Storm Arwen and the following winter storms are still being felt,\" she said. \"Many landowners are still clearing up and this will continue for months to come. \"The forestry sector had its mettle thoroughly tested but it has shown its resilience and is managing the aftermath very well. \"The way so many parts of the industry have pulled together is really quite admirable.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}], "t0": {"text": "The scale of forestry damage caused by Storm Arwen has been significantly underestimated, according to new research."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The scale of damage from Storm Arwen is much greater than first thought, with 8,000 hectares of woodland affected."}, "brio": {"text": "The scale of the damage caused by last year's winter storms has been underestimated by the forestry industry."}}, "67": {"article": "The first woman to serve as foreign secretary has announced she will stand down at the next general election. Dame Margaret Beckett, MP for Derby South, stated her intention to retire at a local Labour Party constituency meeting on Friday. First elected in 1974, Mrs Beckett was also the first woman to briefly serve as party leader. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer hailed Mrs Beckett, calling her a \"trailblazer\". Mrs Beckett served as acting leader of the party in 1994 after the sudden death of John Smith. That year, she ran for election to lead the party full-time, but lost to Tony Blair, who would later make her foreign secretary. She remains the only sitting MP to have served as a minister and junior minister under the last four Labour prime ministers.   She said \"serving the residents of Derby South has been an honour\".  The 79-year-old was first elected as MP for Derby South in 1983, having previously been the MP for Lincoln.  By Georgia Roberts, BBC Radio Derby political reporter Dame Margaret Beckett has served under four prime ministers, including as the first female foreign secretary in 2006 under Tony Blair. She is Britain's longest-serving female MP.  Many local Labour figures were convinced that she may well go on forever, despite turning 79 in January. In their tribute to her following the news, the Derby Labour group on the city council praised her almost 40 years of \"dedication\".  However, though fiercely private, the loss of her husband Leo Beckett in December, her chief of staff and political rock since the beginning of her time as an MP for Lincoln in the 70s, will no doubt have taken its toll.  One of Britain's most celebrated and respected female politicians, she leaves behind a legacy that will be admired across the political spectrum.  Mrs Beckett said: \"It is a step I have been considering for some little time, especially as Leo's health deteriorated, and although he is no longer with me, I believe it is still the right time to stand down.\" Sir Keir paid tribute to the \"legend of our party\". \"As the UK's first female foreign secretary, and Labour's first female leader, she is a trailblazer,\" he said. \"Margaret, I thank you for everything you've given, and achieved.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["brio", "gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}], "t0": {"text": "Dame Margaret Beckett, MP for Derby South, will stand down at the next election."}, "gpt3": {"text": "Dame Margaret Beckett, MP for Derby South, has announced that she will be retiring at the next general election."}, "brio": {"text": "The UK's longest-serving female MP, Dame Margaret Beckett, has announced she will stand down at the next general election."}}, "68": {"article": "A piece of artwork from the cover of a classic Queen album has been sold at auction for more than \u00a328,000.

Hilary Alflatt, 87, assaulted the woman on a number of occasions between 1983 and 1992 while working in Sheffield. The woman told police she endured \"a life of hell for 10 years\" at the hands of Alflatt who was married at the time. Alflatt, who has dementia, was deemed unfit to plead, but after a five-day trial at Hull Crown Court jurors concluded he had assaulted the woman. The retired vicar, previously known as Malcolm, was cleared of five other counts - two of false imprisonment and three of assault - which included claims he had held her prisoner in a room at his vicarage for five days. The jury failed to reach a verdict on a charge of assault relating to an incident when Alflatt branded the woman with a cross-shaped mark using a red-hot needle. In a police interview the woman, who cannot be named, said Alflatt had made her take vows of obedience, poverty and chastity, telling her that to disobey them was \"to disobey God\". She said he would summon her to the vicarage where he would beat her with a cane. She said she became \"conditioned\" not to disobey him, fearing \"I was going to get beaten if I did\". The court heard when she eventually broke away from Alflatt she underwent a \"ritual of release\" to free her of her vows. Alflatt told police it had been a consensual relationship. He said after some time he had wanted to end it and thought that if he \"caused her more pain she would leave me alone\". In her closing speech, prosecutor Louise Reevells told jurors Alflatt was \"a sadistic man in a position of authority who took pleasure in hurting [his victim]\". \"This was not about him trying to end it, this was about the power and control that he could exert over her,\" she said. Judge Sophie McKone told the jury: \"Although you found he did the acts in count seven, the court does not punish him for that because he is not fit to take part in the trial. \"He is not going to go to prison.\" She said her options for dealing with the case were to hand down an absolute discharge, to make a guardianship order or to impose a hospital order.

Elsewhere, two men from Rhymney and Nelson in Caerphilly county, aged 24 and 23, have been arrested on suspicion of arson and burglary. Both men have been released on bail. That followed a fire at the Heads of the Valleys industrial estate in Rhymney at around 01:40 GMT on Saturday, 19 March. Geoff Hall, of North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said the cause of the Mynydd Mawr fire was unclear, but warned people against carrying out controlled burns on land because of the risks of them spreading. \"You need a burn plan in place. Unless you can actually tackle this fire yourself, with your burn plan that you have created, we shouldn't be doing any burns that we can't deal with,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. \"It places a tremendous strain on the resources.\" The current blaze near Y Fron village, near Caernarfon, covered an area of 100,000 sq m on Wednesday, but four appliances and a specialist wildfire unit have been tackling it. A helicopter from south Wales has also travelled up to help by dropping water on the fire, with crews then ready to follow up on foot.  It is hoped it will be out later today.  \"The season we're in, we do have people trying to do controlled burns, which all too often result in uncontrolled burns, which cost us and the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds, as well as the health and safety of the crews who are at stake whilst we're dealing with these,\" Mr Hall added. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said crews were also tackling fires at Rhiw, near Llanbedr in Gwynedd, and in Wrexham. Incidents in Clynnog Fawr and Penygroes were also dealt with in Gwynedd, while a fire at Pant Glas is ongoing.

Hundreds of thousands of square metres of gorse could be seen going up in smoke. A helicopter made continual trips to nearby lakes for water to douse the flames as crews, dwarfed by the mountain, tackled them up close. It's not clear yet what started the inferno but landowners have been asked to ensure controlled burning was done carefully. To nearby residents' relief, crews returned at dawn on Thursday to continue battling the blaze.  As it raged through the night, its glow created an unsettling, eerie focal point.

It is currently illegal to mine in these protected indigenous territories of the Amazon. But Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro wants to change this to allow more exploitation for economic development.  US and UK companies are among those who had applied to open new mines, the report says. But Anglo American and Vale both say they have withdrawn their applications. Protecting the Amazon is crucial in the fight to curb climate change because its enormous number of trees soak up carbon from the atmosphere.  Thousands of indigenous people who live in these areas are also threatened by new developments.  \"We are looking at deforestation in some of the most pristine areas of the Amazon. It will be a tragedy if mining on indigenous lands goes ahead,\" researcher Rosana Miranda, who wrote the report for NGO Amazon Watch, told BBC News. \"Are we willing to give up incredibly rich biodiversity and cultural diversity just to extract more gold and copper for international shareholders?\" she added.  Amazon Watch and the Association of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil are identifying in real-time live applications to Brazil's National Mining Agency to begin mining projects in protected areas. The latest figure is 2,622 applications. Brazilian company Vale has filed the largest number with 75 applications, while UK multi-national Anglo-American has 65.  Both companies had previously promised to withdraw some applications for mining in these areas after pressure from campaigners. In total, 570 companies have filed for permission to begin work in areas affecting 260 indigenous lands, covering 101,000 square kilometres (10.1 million ha). Almost half are for gold mining. Anglo American told BBC News that it made applications to mine on indigenous lands but withdrew them \"several years ago\". It added: \"Several of these applications have not yet been removed from the database of the National Mining Agency (ANM). Anglo American is working with Brazilian government representatives to ensure that on-line tenement databases actually reflect those that have been formally approved.\"  Vale commented: \"Last year, the company announced the relinquishment of all its mining rights in Indigenous Land in Brazil (which includes applications for exploration permits and mining concessions).\" Mines run by global corporations in the Amazon have been associated with toxic spills, river pollution as well as the destruction of indigenous communities. Alessandra Munduruku from the indigenous group Munduruku is an activist defending indigenous lands. \"What is at stake in this mining project is death: death of the rivers, death of the forest, death of the people, death of culture, death of language,\" she told BBC News. The report also claims that huge amounts of international finance is supporting mining companies, suggesting that shareholders around the world are involved in deforestation of the Amazon. Amazon Watch found that the global financial organisations Capital Group and BlackRock hold stakes worth $13.2bn in companies attempting to mine indigenous lands.  In total, eight large mining companies received $54.1bn in financing from banks or asset managers globally in 2016-21, the report claims. Capital Group told BBC News it does not comment on its holdings. BlackRock did not respond to the allegations but highlighted their guidance, which says \"BlackRock Investment Stewardship believes it is important for companies to obtain the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for initiatives that affect their rights.\"  The applications are currently lodged with Brazil's mining agency. It remains illegal to develop these pristine and extremely biodiverse areas of the Amazon. But President Bolsonaro says it is necessary to open up the rainforest to new exploitation and lift communities out of poverty. He has proposed a bill to Congress that would make it possible to exploit these protected regions. Companies who have filed for the right to mine would be first in line, says Amazon Watch. Campaigners say more development of the Amazon would be a disaster for the climate, and for the people living there.

It then lists Cardiff as having lower graduate salaries than Birmingham, London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. A CCR spokesman said attracting more quality jobs should increase wages. The leaflet is part of the CCR's promotional material for MIPIM held in Cannes, France, which describes itself as \"the world's leading real estate event\".

Highlighting the regions strengths, it lists talent, skills, infrastructure, quality of life and competitive property costs. On salaries, under the competitive heading, it reads: \"Our workforce is distinctly younger than the UK average, well-educated and diverse, supported by three highly regarded universities.  \"Salary costs across the region are very competitive.\" It then includes a selective list of university graduate salaries by city, with Cardiff (\u00a325,959) at the bottom behind Birmingham (\u00a327,000), London (\u00a329,000), Edinburgh (\u00a332,143), and Glasgow (\u00a332,500). In 2019, a tweet by Trade and Invest Wales, a Welsh government marketing initiative, trying to attract foreign investment by saying wages are lower than in other part of the UK was accused of being \"sloppy\". The Welsh government said at the time the tweet, which described Wales' workforce as having \"up to 30% lower salary costs than some part of the UK\", was not representative of the wider marketing approach. According to the latest statistics, in 2021 Wales had the lowest average gross weekly earnings of all UK countries: But Wales had higher wages than two areas of England - the north east (\u00a3538.70) and the east midlands (\u00a3559.80).

Nearly two in five employers (38%) told consultants LCP they offered retail discount perk schemes to their staff.  With the cost of living rising at its fastest rate for decades, LCP says more people should use these offers. It suggested that some may consider the savings too small, but money off groceries could build up over time. Heidi Allan, senior consultant at LCP, said: \"Many workplaces offer employee discount schemes which give savings on everyday purchases with household name businesses, such as supermarkets, coffee shops, mobile phone companies and travel businesses.   \"Yet in some cases workers may not be aware of the scheme or may think it is not relevant to them. The truth is that we are all going to face a squeeze on our budgets in the coming months and every penny we can save is going to help.\" Food prices have been rising and are set to rise further, and some employers offer schemes giving a small percentage discount on reloadable shopping cards, or loyalty points. People may have to sign up to gift cards and vouchers and get into the habit of using them, but LCP suggests savings over time could be helpful to family finances. Its survey suggested another 27% of employers were considering introducing such schemes in the next 12 months.

Aviva Investors also wants bosses' pay to be linked to sustainability goals. It is the latest big investment firm to ramp up the pressure on corporations in a bid to make them clean up their acts. BlackRock, the world's largest fund, has told the firms it invests in to step up on sustainability or face the consequences. Aviva Investors, which has \u00a3262bn of assets under management, set out its expectations in a letter that will be sent to 1,500 firms in 30 countries this week. The fund said it had broadened its definition of sustainability and would now focus on issues such as biodiversity and human rights, alongside existing priorities like climate change and executive pay. \"We will hold boards and individual directors accountable where the pace of change does not reflect the urgency required,\" said the annual letter from Aviva Investors boss Mark Versey. Mr Versey said there had been an \"alarming\" 68% decrease in animal and plant species between 1970 and 2016. \"This is of serious concern as ecosystem services provided by the natural world underpin our economies and societies and will increasingly become an important driver of company valuations,\" Mr Versey said, adding that more than half of the world's economic output is \"reliant on biodiversity\". On human rights, Aviva expects companies it backs to scrutinise the impact they have when doing business, and to take action to stop harm. Firms will need to give more detailed explanations of how they intend to meet environmental goals, it added. Mirza Baig, Aviva Investors' head of environmental, social and corporate governance, told the BBC that some companies intentionally set vague targets to avoid being held to account.  He said Aviva would increasingly use its vote as a shareholder to try to oust directors at firms that had a \"high impact\" on the planet but did little to rectify this. The fund may also vote against executive pay deals if a firm is falling short, and as a last resort could withdraw its investment. Last year 280 firms changed their practices after pressure from Aviva Investors, Mr Baig said. However, he urged more big investment firms to use their \"loud\" and \"influential\" voices to drive change.    \"If there was enough pressure being put on businesses then the world would look very different,\" he said. Big investment funds are increasingly leaning on firms to make them change the way they do business. Last week Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's biggest investment fund, denied that the firm was being \"woke\" in calling for stronger climate policies from companies.  Instead, he said the move made good business sense at a time when the public increasingly expects companies to behave ethically. He insisted his firm was being capitalist in its outlook, adding: \"Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company's success.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["brio", "t0"], "worst_summary": ["gpt3"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3", "brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3", "brio"], "worst_summary": ["gpt3"]}], "t0": {"text": "The boss of Aviva Investors has warned firms it backs to clean up their act or face the risk of losing investment."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The article discusses how investment firms are putting pressure on companies to improve their environmental and sustainability policies."}, "brio": {"text": "Companies that fail to tackle climate change, biodiversity and human rights will face pressure from investors."}}, "76": {"article": "A man tried to smuggle cocaine into the UK by hiding it inside a duck ornament flown in from South America.

Patches of white on the X-ray led NCA officers to drill holes in the duck. A pink sticky substance leaked out, which tested positive for cocaine and could have been converted into the powdered version of the drug, the NCA added. Its officers also found Albanian national Alushi was living in the UK illegally. Lydia Bloomfield, branch commander at the NCA, said: \"This is certainly one of the most unusual attempts to smuggle drugs we've seen, and it shows the lengths that organised crime groups are willing to go in an attempt to avoid detection.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Jonathan Huw Howells, from Lampeter Velfrey, Pembrokeshire was clearing branches near the 11,000 volt powerline last November as a favour to a friend. The coroner's court heard a witness saw Mr Howells being electrocuted and the forklift tyres catching fire. The inquest jury, at Haverfordwest, concluded the death was an accident. Mr Howells, know as Huw, was a married father of two, the inquest heard. He had agreed to trim some trees for an elderly friend using his telehandler, which is similar to a forklift but can use different attachments or booms. Mr Howells spent the day cutting branches for farmer Emrys Davies as a favour at Dan y Coed Farm in Llawhaden, near Narberth, using a chainsaw attached to a telescopic boom. The telehandler was operated by another man, Brian Tooze, who was a longstanding friend. After deciding to finish work at 16:20 GMT that day, Mr Howells decided to investigate whether the boom would reach some high branches near powerlines at the farm. The inquest heard written evidence from Mr Tooze who described Mr Howells as \"being very capable and careful with machinery\". Mr Tooze said Mr Howells knew he had to be \"extra careful\" as the branches were close to an overhead powerline.  Mr Howells raised the box of the telehandler to a safe level under the direction of Mr Tooze who shouted \"that's high enough\" when it reached the necessary height. The boom was at this point some 2ft (about 0.6m) away from the powerlines. Mr Howells then left the cab and stood back to survey whether the box was high enough to trim the branches.  Mr Tooze described how Mr Howells lent into the cab of the telehandler and the boom lifted up closer to the wires. \"I don't know what he did, but the boom of the Merlo [telehandler trademark] moved up but didn't touch the powerline,\" said Mr Tooze. \"The electricity must have arced [when electrical current jumps from one electric conductor to another]. I could see he was being electrocuted.\" Mr Tooze said the front left tyre of the machine caught fire and exploded and the another tyre was also alight. \"I told him to let go, but I knew he couldn't hear me.\" Mr Tooze said he also received an electric shock while trying to help Mr Howells and was later treated at Glangwili Hospital. In his evidence, Mr Tooze said Mr Howells eventually \"collapsed and let go\". Despite attempts to revive him, he died at the scene. Mr Tooze described Mr Howells as a \"good family friend, reliable and trustworthy\". The inquest heard written evidence from pathologist Dr John Murphy, at Glangwili Hospital, who carried out the post-mortem examination. He concluded Mr Howells died from electrocution due to a farmyard accident.  Two Health and Safety Executive (HSE) officers also gave evidence. Lead investigator Rhys Hughes said it was clear Mr Howells had undertaken the work as a favour and he had not been paid for the maintenance work. Stephen Eades, who specialises in incidents relating to electricity, said powerlines at the property were above the necessary stipulated heights.  But he explained that the 11,000 volt cable on site was not insulated and if anybody came into contact with the cable that person would be electrocuted.  Mr Eades explained that although the boom of the telehandler did not make contact with the powerline, direct contact was not necessary to make electricity travel due to the high voltage, as the electricity supply would look to earth itself through the nearest point of contact.  He added that investigations could not reveal why the boom moved up towards the powerline when Mr Howells lent into the cab.  Mr Eades said there was clear guidance both from the HSE and the electricity distributor, Western Power Distribution, about working near powerlines.  He said there was a 3m (about 9ft) \"exclusion zone\" for working around 11,0000 volt cables.  He described Mr Howells' death as a \"very unfortunate accident\". Mr Hughes added that the telehandler was \"well maintained\" and in \"good order\". A member of Mr Howells's family told the inquest he had previously worked closely alongside Western Power Distribution and the family could not understand why this had happened.", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["t0", "brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["t0", "brio"]}, {"best_summary": ["gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["brio"]}], "t0": {"text": "A tree surgeon was electrocuted after his forklift truck touched an overhead power cable while trimming trees, an inquest has heard."}, "gpt3": {"text": "The death of Jonathan Huw Howells was ruled an accident after he was electrocuted while trimming branches near an overhead powerline."}, "brio": {"text": "A 42-year-old man was electrocuted when he was using a forklift truck to trim trees close to an overhead powerline, an inquest has heard."}}, "78": {"article": "A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after two men died in a crash on a dual carriageway.

The Lessons Learned review warned of deep-rooted concerns over the process, saying the Home Office was at \"tipping point\" and could face a fresh scandal.  Victim Glenda Caesar said the scheme should be run by another body. The Home Office said progress had been made but there was more to do. The compensation scheme was launched by the Home Office in April 2019 to offer payments to people, mainly from the Caribbean, who had come to the UK legally but did not have the documents to prove their right to remain. In 2018, it emerged many had lost homes, jobs and access to welfare benefits and NHS services after being wrongly classed as illegal citizens under strict Home Office immigration policy - while some were wrongly detained and even deported. The review had been looking at the progress made since the independent report by author Wendy Williams in 2020, which found the scandal was \"avoidable\" and victims were let down by \"systemic operational failings\" at the Home Office. In the latest review, Ms Williams said she was \"disappointed\" with the progress made by the government, and called for a migrants' commissioner, better engagement with the public and a higher standard of training for staff. Ms Williams and her team reviewed more than 3,000 documents and spoke to hundreds of people.  Ms Caesar, who was denied the right to work for nearly a decade, said: \"We have got people out in the community who are still waiting to get payments and it's very difficult with the helpline... \"Us as a community and grassroots organisations have given them [Home Office] so many ideas for them to improve the system, but it doesn't seem to be working.\" The mother, who came to the UK as baby, lost her job as an NHS administrator in 2009 and faced deportation.  She added: \"We are being pushed to the bottom of the line again.\" Others say that the compensation they have been offered is \"insulting\".  Fitzroy Maynard came to the UK from Antigua. Despite living in London for most of his life, between the years of 2009-2018 he was unable to work or claim benefits, which left him homeless. Mr Maynard said the compensation he has been offered - \u00a340,000 minus \u00a310,000 he has already received - was \"very insulting\" as it was based on a technicality and said he did not accept what he had been put through. \"The trauma doesn't disappear, it will always stay with you,\" he said.  \"They [the Home Office] don't want to take any blame - they want to put all the blame on me.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are committed to righting the wrongs of the Windrush generation which is why we work closely with each claimant to ensure they receive the maximum compensation they deserve.\" The review said the Home Office had made progress in some areas, including its outreach programme and in forming a strategic race board. Home Secretary Priti Patel said there had been a radical change and a \"total transformation of culture\" at the department.  She said: \"We have already made significant progress and Wendy highlights many achievements, including the work we have put into becoming a more compassionate and open organisation. \"Having said that, there is more to do and I will not falter in my commitment to everyone who was affected by the Windrush scandal.\" There has been long-running criticism of the Windrush Compensation Scheme by victims, their families and campaigners who say the process has taken too long and applications are too complicated.

The council said it was \"disappointed\" with the announcement. A recent audit found evidence of poor behaviour and a lack of trust across the organisation. The council was said to be \"insular and siloed\" but improvements were also highlighted.

The ongoing inquiry into Brook House removal centre, near Gatwick Airport, is examining the mistreatment of detainees, as well as the attitudes and culture of staff.  It follows a series of investigations triggered by BBC Panorama in 2017. In a statement a detainee claimed his cellmate was earning up to \u00a3400 a day supplying others in the centre. Parcels of contraband would be prepared outside to be brought in by custody officers working for G4S, which ran Brook House at the time, it was claimed. The inquiry heard one officer, described as \"totally corrupt\", was smuggling in the packages before handing them over to detainees.  The inquiry is currently considering the alleged failures of Brook House to deal with the mental health problems of people being held.   The drugs claims were made in the statement, read to the inquiry, of a man who arrived in the UK from Somalia in 1994.   After he admitted a series of criminal offences, and served time in prison, he was taken to Brook House to await deportation. The detainee, codenamed D687, gave evidence to the inquiry of the centre's failure to manage his diagnosed PTSD and depression.  He also said that another man being held at Brook House was obtaining drugs. In his statement he said: \"I asked how he was bringing drugs in. He told me he had an officer doing that bit for him.\" D687 asked which officer, and said he was pointed to a custody officer he knew by the nickname \"Ginge\".   He told the inquiry he had since identified the officer as Luke Instone-Brewer.  \"My cellmate was also selling drugs at Brook House and separately told me that Ginge was bringing it in,\" D687 said. The inquiry heard that packages of contraband, which also contained weapons, were prepared outside the centre. Detainees would arrange for a delivery fee of \u00a3500 per package to be paid into a bank account, plus a few pennies to identify the transaction, the inquiry heard. Inside Brook House a detainee would take delivery, confirming exactly how much had been paid.  D687 said parcels would be sold on to his cellmate, who would then split it up and supply other detainees by slipping bags of drugs under cell doors, charging \u00a325 per delivery. Cannabis and spice use remains rife at Brook House according to detainees who spoke to the BBC from inside the facility last year.   G4S handed over the operation of Brook House to Serco in 2020. D687 told the inquiry in his statement that using drugs made his mental health issues worse, and in 2017 he tried to hang himself.  The aftermath of this suicide attempt was captured by secret cameras smuggled into Brook House by the BBC Panorama reporter Callum Tulley, who was working as a custody officer.  The resulting documentary led to the current public inquiry.  Panorama filmed 109 hours of footage and captured many incidents in which detainees were suffering the effects of spice.  D687 said in his statement that during his time at Brook House: \"I was treated like an animal, something less than human. \"It has left an impact on me and my mental health which I don't think I'll ever get over. \"When I entered Brook House I felt relatively normal.

His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures and the project went viral. The art was displayed in a gallery before being auctioned for charity. A total of 250 new pieces are being sold on eBay to raise the extra cash, which will also go to Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity.  It will be used to improve Colchester hospital's neonatal unit, while the initial project funded a new sensory room and garden, with work due to start soon.

At a committee discussing the impact of body image on physical and mental health, the musician said he wished he had opened up to friends at the time. And he said no doctor had ever asked if he was sure he wanted to have surgery. Concerns over weight or body shape can often lead to eating disorders, which are particularly common in teenagers. Two leading medical organisations have told BBC News GPs are not receiving the right support to treat eating disorders.  Doctors said they needed more time with patients and more specialist units. Brittain-McVey, 27, said he had started worrying about how his body looked aged 14-15.  At school, he struggled to feel he fitted in - and that led him to the gym, prompted by what he saw advertised on social media and by \"big American surf style companies\". \"I had one of their shopping bags in my bedroom, of a guy ripped on a beach in Malibu, and I think unconsciously every morning I would think that is what I need to look like,\" the musician said. \"Social media encouraged me to fall further down that rabbit hole.  \"The first thoughts I would have when I woke up in the morning was, 'Should I be eating that, am I going to be able to get to the gym?\"' He described worrying about what he ate aged 15-16 - and by the time The Vamps started, he decided to have surplus natural breast tissue in his chest, a condition called gynaecomastia, removed. \"People presume it was me striving for vanity - but it was pressure to conform to stereotypes and gender constructs,\" Brittain-McVey said.  \"And before I realised it, my whole life was controlled by this chase to look a certain way.\" His family was supportive of his decision but he was too embarrassed to tell many of his friends or bandmates.

Asked if any doctors had discussed with him why he wanted liposuction, Brittain-McVey said: \"Before surgery, I don't think anyone said, 'Are you sure?'\" In 2018, he joined ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! and came out of the Australian jungle having lost 4-5kg (11lb). \"My wife was shocked how ill I looked - but I was happy I had a six-pack again,\" he said.

It looked at the available evidence to date from 15 studies around the world.  The findings suggest that while some who are jabbed catch Covid, vaccines reduce infection risk and illness, including symptoms like fatigue.  And unvaccinated people who catch Covid and get symptoms of long Covid, do better if they then get vaccinated.   Some of the studies in the review looked at the effect of vaccinations given before infection and found: Others that looked at the effects of vaccines in people who already had long-Covid symptoms found: According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), around 2% of the UK population have reported symptoms of long Covid, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and muscle or joint pain.  Symptoms like these can last for more than four weeks after the infection.  People who received two doses of a vaccine against Covid are less likely to experience this or will have the symptoms for a shorter time.  Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UKHSA, said: \"These studies add to the potential benefits of receiving a full course of the Covid-19 vaccination.

Paul Johnson, 56, who worked at Hull Royal Infirmary's Women and Children's Hospital, was suspended in late 2020.  In total, 29 charges were proven at a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) misconduct hearing and he was found to have committed serious misconduct.  The panel heard women \"must be able to trust midwives with their lives\".  Multiple charges of behaving in an \"intimidating, bullying or unsupportive manner\" towards colleagues were among those the hearing had found to be proven. The hearing previously heard Mr Johnson took the photos of the women having C-sections at the hospital and sent them to a colleague with whom he was in a relationship. The colleague was also sent a video of him performing a sex act in a hospital toilet while on duty, with Mr Johnson also gaining the ward nickname of the \"Scarlet Pimpernel\" due to repeated instances of him disappearing while on shift.  Derek McFaul, NMC panel chair, told the hearing that \"midwives must be honest, open and act with integrity\". \"Members of the public would find it difficult to place their trust in a midwife who had displayed bullying, sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour, made sexual comments to patients and colleagues, made dishonest representations to his employer and put patients at risk of harm by means of his poor management of a ward,\" he said. Mr Johnson told the panel on Thursday he was on a \"downward spiral\" at the time due to private problems arising from the relationship with the colleague. He told the hearing: \"I'm able to look now and see the impact some of my behaviour has had on people who surrounded me and I am sorry for the experience they had and I'm sorry for the fact they had to experience it.\" Mr Johnson worked for Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust for 18 years and delivered hundreds of babies in the city. An 18-month interim suspension order was put in place, allowing Mr Johnson the opportunity to lodge an appeal against the NMC panel's decision. In a statement, the NHS trust said: \"In the two years since he last worked for us our maternity service has worked hard to improve the culture and team-working of the unit. \"This work has included regular communication with staff, leadership training and coaching, as well as introducing new and improved ways of working.\"", "annotators": [{"best_summary": ["brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["brio"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}, {"best_summary": ["brio", "gpt3"], "worst_summary": ["t0"]}], "t0": {"text": "A senior midwife at a Hull hospital who had a sexual relationship with a colleague has been struck off."}, "gpt3": {"text": "A midwife who was found to have bullied colleagues and taken photos of two women without their consent during Caesarean sections has been struck off."}, "brio": {"text": "A senior midwife who was found to have bullied colleagues and taken photos of two women without their consent during Caesarean sections has been struck off."}}, "89": {"article": "Almost 400 migrants were brought into Dover after crossing the Channel on Tuesday, the Home Office confirmed.

Several children were among those to be brought ashore on Tuesday. The Home Office said that 213 people were rescued on six boats and brought to shore on Monday, while on Tuesday last week 405 people made the crossing - in what is thought to have been the highest daily total so far in 2022. The number of people attempting to make the journey tends to increase during warmer and calmer weather. Tom Pursglove, minister for tackling illegal migration, said the rise in crossings was \"unacceptable\". He said Channel crossings impacted UK taxpayers, risked lives and the UK's ability to help refugees who come to the UK via legal routes.

Mr Ormrod said it was \"surreal\" to see the giant artwork.

Mike Tomlinson won an order of merit from the charity, England and Wales Blind Golf, in September 2021, but says he has since only played a handful of times as he cannot find guides.

The 62-year-old, who has Stargardt disease, began playing blind golf about two years ago and has won the British Blind Masters, and played twice for the English national team.  Blind golf is played in the same way as sighted golf except that players have guides to assist in lining up the shot and give an idea of the conditions. Although Mr Tomlinson has a guide for tournaments, he has no help locally to enable him to practice. \"I can't get out at all... I basically practice in my kitchen,\" he said. Mr Tomlinson said: \"When you start losing your sight, you lose your independence, you have to rely on other people, but playing golf you get your independence back. \"You feel you belong to something, it is a community. I really look forward to tournaments, but enjoy just as much meeting up with all the people who play the golf - we are all in the same boat and have a laugh together.\" Mr Tomlinson is looking for someone who lives close to him in the West Midlands who can help with spotting his ball and to avoid obstacles.

One of the protesters, Steph, said: \"They'll probably leave it for a few weeks and just hope that we get bored.\" They are opposing the construction of the high speed railway between Fradley and Crewe.

Naeem Hijazi, 24, is in Germany, having escaped conflict for the third time.  After leaving behind the war in Syria with his parents in 2013, he then had to abandon his medical studies in Sudan during a military coup.  His family, who resettled in Dumfries as Syrian refugees, are now desperate to bring him home.  Naeem is one of about one million people who have left Ukraine since the Russian army invaded last week.  His mother Sarab Meslmani told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that she was \"relieved\" he had reached Germany after a gruelling journey out of Ukraine.  \"It was very difficult for him,\" she said. \"He walked about 65km and before that he stayed on the train for about 30 hours.\" During his journey on foot the temperature at night dropped to -5C.  The Polish government transported him to Germany, and having crossed the border on Tuesday night, Naeem was finally able to call his mother to tell him he was safe in a hotel on Wednesday. His uncle Asem Muslmani, who lives in Glasgow and works as an assistant pharmacist in Dumfries, said Naeem was now \"stateless\" and unable to leave Germany.  Naeem began reading medicine at the Red Sea University in Port Sudan five years ago but his studies came to a halt after the military coup in 2019. He went to Ukraine on a student visa and had been given a place to resume second year studies in medicine at Karazin National University in Kharkiv shortly before the Russian invasion.  \"It started in Syria, then Lebanon, then Sudan, then Ukraine. He fled Ukraine, he reached Germany,\" Mr Muslmani said. \"He is scared, he wants to reunite with his family again. His mother is suffering also from loneliness, from sadness. \"We are begging the Home Office to bring Naeem here, to restart his life here again.\" Mr Muslmani said: \"It's too long - five years - for a young kid. He's suffered a lot. I think he needs some rest at the end of his journey. \"His family, his father and mother came here to Scotland to settle here without their only son.\" Naeem is not entitled to return under the new visa rules for Ukrainians, as he is not a citizen of the country.  \"The only hope is that the Home Office can hear this problem, this humanitarian issue, and bring Naeem here to Dumfries, to his family, and start again,\" Mr Muslmani added.  Naeem and his parents, Mrs Meslmani and her husband Abdul Majeed Hijazi, left their home in Homs, Syria for Lebanon in 2013.  They were offered resettlement through a UN scheme in 2017, but by then Naeem, who had just turned 18, was studying in Sudan where tuition costs were much less expensive.  Naeem was refused re-entry to Lebanon in time to join his parents in the resettlement scheme, and an assurance that he would be processed separately came to nothing.  Since their arrival in the UK in September 2018 his parents have been trying to secure his return through a family reunion visa. They had already begun an appeal against the rejection of his first application when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Naeem had not been in Ukraine long before he caught Covid-19 and did not know anyone who could support him through his illness, his uncle told the BBC.  \"He did not have a lot of time to recover from it before the invasion happened,\" Mr Muslmani said.  \"Naeem has suffered through three wars now in three different countries, I think the least thing he deserves is to finally feel safe and settled with his family at home in Dumfries. \"His parents only have him and he only has them.
