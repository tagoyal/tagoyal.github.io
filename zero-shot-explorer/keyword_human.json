        "input": "(CNN)John Wayne Gacy remains the stuff of nightmares, a symbol of evil with the dress-up-like-a-clown twist to ensure his enduring place in the true-crime genre. \"Conversations With a Killer: The John Wayne Gacy Tapes\" finds the wispiest hook to add to that filmography, drawing from 60 hours of unearthed audio sprinkled throughout this three-part Netflix docuseries. The problem with the new recordings, which were conducted by Gacy's lawyers, is that Gacy seeks to deflect blame for everything, as he was known for doing. In a 1994 New Yorker article (the year Gacy was executed by lethal injection), writer Alec Wilkinson summed up the challenge of interviewing him, noting, \"Talking to Gacy requires patience. He doesn't listen to what you say, and consider it, and then respond. He merely defends himself. It is difficult to ask him a question that a detective or a prosecutor or a defense attorney or a psychiatrist has not already asked him and that he does not have an answer for.\" Faced with that, just hearing Gacy's voice doesn't really add much to an understanding of what motivated him or the hideous nature of his crimes, a task that falls to the usual suspects, including surviving police and prosecutors involved in breaking the case back in the 1970s. There are also interviews with relatives of those killed, and one survivor of Gacy's attacks. Their stories are horrific, recounting how the smell of decaying flesh ultimately gave Gacy away, ending a killing spree that included 33 victims, resulting in his conviction in 1980. Yet what stands out in this project from director Joe Berlinger (whose serial-killer resume includes \"Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes\") is the historical context of how Gacy exploited the vulnerability of young men and teens, especially those who had left home or been cast out by their families. Otherwise, there's not much that's really new here, with Peacock's \"John Wayne Gacy: Devil in Disguise\" having covered similar territory just last year. But Netflix provides both a wider platform, and the project comes with a somewhat more contemporary hook amid ongoing efforts continue to identify Gacy's victims, some of whom remain unknown. Because Gacy was active in his community and local politics, one of the lingering questions has always been, as the press notes phrase it, \"How was a public figure like Gacy able to get away with murder for so long?\" Meticulously researched, \"Conversations With a Killer\" provides welcome context on that level, including homophobia that's reflected in Gacy's own discussions in which he explains his attraction to men as well as women. As for why serial killers like Bundy and Gacy have exerted such a lasting hold on the public consciousness, that's a sad fact of the true-crime genre that, at this stage, doesn't require an explanation. \"Conversations With a Killer: The John Wayne Gacy Tapes\" premieres April 20 on Netflix.",

A flyer obtained by CNN affiliate KTVT-TV described the event as an all-day field party featuring several rappers. The concert was believed to have been attended by several thousand people, KTVT reported. Police responded to the shooting shortly after 11:30 p.m. Saturday. Officers arrived and learned multiple victims -- including three juveniles -- were shot while attending the concert on Cleveland Road. CNN previously reported at least 10 were injured Saturday. Garcia said Monday that 16 people were shot. \"Sixteen individuals were transported by private vehicles and ambulances to different hospitals,\" Garcia said Monday. \"All are listed in stable condition.\" Police have only identified the deceased as a 26-year-old, who first responders found lying near the stage, a Sunday news release said. The victim died at the scene. According to a preliminary investigation, authorities believe one person fired a gun into the air while a second fired a gun in the crowd's direction. Garcia noted seven off-duty Dallas police officers who were working the event left around 11 p.m., prior to the shooting. \"While the off-duty employment was approved, these officers should not have been working the event that had no permit,\" Garcia said. \"We're looking at our internal policies to take a closer look at approvals for these types of jobs, ensuring that they comply with city ordinances and policies.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, voted Thursday to dissolve itself, triggering new elections. On Friday, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid will officially take over as caretaker prime minister under the terms of a coalition agreement made between outgoing Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Lapid last year. Because Lapid -- a former journalist and star TV anchor -- is a caretaker prime minister, there will be no formal swearing-in ceremony. Thursday's 92-0 vote finally concludes the slow motion ending to Bennett's run as prime minister -- one of the shortest terms in Israeli history -- and gives former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a potential path to return to power. As the vote concluded, Lapid and Bennett wrapped their arms around each other, hugged and switched seats so that Lapid was sitting in the prime minister's position. When they were departing the Knesset floor, Bennett accidentally took Lapid's cellphone. \"My brother,\" Lapid said, \"you took my phone.\" Bennett replied, \"My brother, you took my job.\" New elections will be held on November 1 -- the fifth round of voting for Israelis in less than four years. Recent polling shows former  prime minister Netanyahu's Likud party on track to win the most number of seats, but the polls do not show that his right-wing bloc will necessarily have enough seats to gain a parliamentary majority and be able to form a ruling government. Speaking on the parliament floor before the dissolution vote, Netanyahu vowed to return to power. \"We are the only alternative: a strong national government, stable and responsible.  A government that will return the national honor to the citizens of Israel,\" Netanyahu said. The night before the dissolution, Bennett announced he would be stepping back from politics and would not run for re-election. \"I will remain a loyal soldier of this country, which I have served all my life as a soldier, officer, minister and prime minister. The State of Israel is the love of my life. To serve her is my destiny,\" Bennett said in a speech to the nation. \"Now is my time to step back a little. Look at things from the outside.\" The coalition government had been teetering for weeks.  But Bennett and Lapid's announcement  last week that they wanted to dissolve their own government and hand power to Lapid came as a surprise. \"In the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government.  In our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest,\" Bennett said earlier this month, standing alongside Lapid. \"Believe me, we looked under every rock. We didn't do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you citizens of Israel,\" Bennett added. The Bennett-Lapid government was sworn into office in June last year bringing an end to Netanyahu's premiership, which had lasted more than 12 years. Made up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an Arab party, led by Mansour Abbas. United in a desire to prevent Netanyahu -- whose corruption trial had already begun in May 2020 -- from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side. Although it notched significant domestic and diplomatic achievements, it was internal politics that ultimately brought the coalition down. Recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation. The political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a Knesset vote failed to uphold the application of Israeli criminal and civil law to Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Among other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives Israeli settlers  in Palestinian territories the same legal treatment as  they have within Israel's borders, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including Prime Minister Bennett. But two members of the coalition  refused to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass. Because parliament dissolved before the law expired on July 1, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed , at which time it will again go up for a vote.",

A post from ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency said a suicide bomber trained by the militant group had carried out the attack, which struck the mosque during Friday prayers. Peshawar police chief Mohammad Ejaz Khan said investigations were still underway. \"(The attacker) walked into Kucha Risalda Mosque during Friday prayers, he started firing indiscriminately at the police and then set off the explosives on him,\" Khan said. The attack was the deadliest in Pakistan since July 2018, when a strike carried out by ISIS killed 149 people in the city of Quetta. Pakistan's intelligence agencies had \"all the information regarding the origins of where the terrorists came from & are going after them with full force,\" the country's Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a tweet on Friday night. Pakistan's Shia minority has long been the target of violence by Sunni Muslim Islamist militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. Thousands have been killed, many of them Shia Muslims, in sectarian violence in Pakistan, according to Human Rights Watch and other monitoring groups.",

We're seeing that in a few days, in a couple of weeks, we're seeing over 500 cases. This is different. This has not been seen before.\" In an update over the weekend, WHO said that as of Thursday, it had received reports of 257 confirmed monkeypox cases and about 120 suspected cases in 23 nations where the virus is not endemic. Lewis said WHO does not know the source of the outbreak and called on countries to take advantage of the \"window of opportunity\" to keep cases from unfolding into a greater outbreak. The group said in its weekend briefing that the global public health risk level is moderate, \"considering this is the first time that monkeypox cases and clusters are reported concurrently in widely disparate WHO geographical areas, and without known epidemiological links to non-endemic countries in West or Central Africa.\" However, it added, \"The public health risk could become high if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a human pathogen and spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease such as young children and immunosuppressed persons.\" WHO is urging health care providers to watch closely for possible symptoms such as rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, headache, back pain, muscle aches and fatigue, and to offer testing to anyone who has these symptoms. During a news briefing Monday, Lewis said \"we are not concerned of a global pandemic\" from monkeypox at the moment. The virus is not new, she noted on CNNI, but WHO is set to meet this week to establish a research agenda and research priorities for the virus. \"It's been there before, and we do have a baseline of knowledge that we can build on, but there are many questions still,\" she said.",

Spacey, 62, was also charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent, police said. The actor will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on Thursday. The charges relate to two alleged incidents in London in 2005, another two in 2008, and a further incident in Gloucestershire in 2013. The alleged victim of the 2005 incidents is now in his 40s, while the two men allegedly involved in the 2008 and 2013 incidents are now in their 30s, the force said. The decision to formally charge Spacey came after \"a review by the Crown Prosecution Service of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation,\" police added. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorized the charges against the actor last month, but the charges could not be formally applied until he was in the UK. Following the CPS authorization, Spacey had said he intended to travel to the UK to deny the charges, according to a statement released to Good Morning America reported by the UK's PA Media news agency. \"While I am disappointed with their decision to move forward, I will voluntarily appear in the UK as soon as can be arranged and defend myself against these charges, which I am confident will prove my innocence,\" the statement read. Spacey has won two Academy Awards for his roles in \"The Usual Suspects\" and \"American Beauty,\" and was artistic director of London's Old Vic theater from 2003 to 2015. He has also starred in the Netflix political series \"House of Cards,\" and returned to acting in the past year.",

        "input": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Global stocks and oil prices fell on Monday as rising Covid-19 cases in Beijing sparked fears that the Chinese capital could join Shanghai and other major cities in lockdown. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) sank 5.1% to close at a 22-month low. It was the worst day for the index since February 3, 2020, when the initial coronavirus outbreak first rocked the nation's stock market. Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 3.7%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) dropped 1.9%, and Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) lost 1.7%. European stocks also opened sharply lower on Monday. The FTSE 100 (UKX) fell 2.1% in London, while Germany's DAX (DAX) slid 1.5%. France's CAC 40 (CAC40) dropped 2.2%, despite market relief at President Emmanuel Macron's election victory over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The fall in Asian and European markets came after a grim session on Friday for US stocks. The Dow fell about 980 points, or 2.8%, following comments about likely aggressive interest rate hikes from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped more than 2.5%, too. Fears about China's worsening Covid-19 situation are adding to the downside momentum. On Monday, Dow futures were down 305 points, or 0.9%, while futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both down 1%. Beijing, the capital of China with 21 million residents, began mass testing over the weekend and shut down residential compounds, raising concerns that more stringent restrictions could soon be implemented in line with other Chinese cities. \"Although some parts of China have been under restrictions longer than Shanghai, Omicron's arrival in Beijing would be an ominous development,\" wrote Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist for Oanda, on Monday. \"China is the world's second-largest economy and has shown no signs it intends to live with the virus,\" he said. \"With that in mind, the likely pressure valve is going to be disruption to China's export machine, and a cratering of consumer confidence.\" Oil prices tumbled on Monday as worries about faster US rate increases and China's slowdown weighed on sentiment. Futures for US oil and Brent crude, the international benchmark, both fell more than 4%. \"It seems that China is the elephant in the room and markets feel that slowing China growth could materially change the supply/demand equation on international markets,\" Halley said. The pressure to contain the outbreak in Beijing comes as cases continue to grow in Shanghai. The lockdown in Shanghai has already forced many factories to suspend production and made shipping delays worse, threatening to deal a hefty shock to its vast economy and place more strain on global supply chains. Shanghai reported more than 19,000 new cases and 51 deaths on Sunday.",

The shipments from Jamaica were discovered at processing centers in Cincinnati, New York and Philadelphia, the CBP said. Each shipment contained four souvenir insulated thermal cups packed with tea bags, bagged spices or vaporizing ointment in addition to 250 to 260 grams of cocaine. The cocaine was hidden within the insulating layer of each cup, the CBP said. The scheme was first discovered on March 10, when CBP officers in Philadelphia noticed that the cups they were inspecting were \"unusually heavy.\" When they drilled into the wall of a cup, they discovered a white powder that tested positive for cocaine. Customs officers then identified three similar shipments from Jamaica that were in transit and being processed at centers in Cincinnati, New York and Philadelphia, and tipped off officers there. All were found to contain cocaine. \"These cocaine seizures perfectly illustrate how Customs and Border Protection officers across the country routinely collaborate to intercept shipments of dangerous drugs and force traffickers to work hard to change concealment tactics and supply routes,\" Joseph Martella, CBP's area port director in Philadelphia, said in the agency's April 26 news release.",

Those aspirations were cut short Thursday when Sampson died after falling from the FreeFall drop tower ride at ICON Park in Orlando, Florida. The FreeFall takes riders to the top of a 430-foot tower and falls at speeds of up to 75 mph, the ICON Park's website says. Operators call it the world's tallest freestanding drop tower, the sheriff's office said. Tyre \"was a very good young man. He was a big teddy bear, a gentle giant,\" Yarnell Sampson said, adding Tyre would give the shirt off his back to anyone who needed it. Tyre, who was from St. Louis, was visiting Orlando with his football team over spring break, his father said. \"He gave me reason to live,\"  Yarnell Sampson told CNN. \"He earned a right to enjoy himself and, unfortunately, he lost his life on that ride.\" 'Somebody people loved to be around' Brandon Gregory had the opportunity to coach Tyre only since January during an off season football program, but he told CNN it was enough time to know that the eighth-grader was destined for greatness on and off the field. \"He showed respect for others, he was still saying sir and yes ma'am in 2022,\" Yarnell Sampson said. Tyre attended middle school in the St. Louis area but was practicing at his future high school across the river with Gregory and his players at East Saint Louis High School in East St. Louis, Illinois. Tyre was \"somebody that people love to be around,\" Gregory told CNN. \"Sometimes, guys that big could be intimidating but he didn't have that intimidation factor .. just the way he carried himself around some of the smaller guys.\" Yarnell Sampson said his son was 6-foot-5-inches and weighed 340 pounds Gregory said Tyre didn't let his size stop him from performing like his peers. \"We take our workouts to the brink of disaster, but he always fought through,\" Gregory said. \"Even if he had to take a break, he would get it done.\" The last memory Gregory has of Tyre is saying goodbye to one another in the weight room ahead of the school's spring break. \"Everybody will remember him as the football player who had a bright future,\" Gregory said. \"But like I tell my kids, the football will go flat at some point and I just think Tyre was going to eventually go on to be a great father, a great husband, great uncle, on top of being a good football player.\" Investigation into what happened continues In video circulating on social media that purportedly shows the incident, a person falls from their seat about five seconds into the ride's drop down the tower, as the vehicle decelerates before it reaches the ground. While holding back tears, Sampson told CNN he viewed the video of his son's death on Facebook. \"I saw the video of my son falling down, and I couldn't believe (it). My life stopped,\" Sampson said. The FreeFall ride passed a safety inspection in December before it was allowed to open, according to an inspection report obtained by CNN. Sheriff's investigators will determine whether the incident was an accident or intentional, and from an initial investigation, \"it appears to be a terrible tragedy,\" Orange County Sheriff John Mina said. The ride has been closed until further notice while the incident is investigated. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has statewide responsibility to inspect all amusement rides in Florida, except for those at large parks that have more than 1,000 employees and have full-time inspectors on staff. \"The pain behind this can never be taken away, no money, nothing in the world can replace that young man,\" Yarnell Sampson said. \"It's just sad a young man with a bright future taken away from him over a ride.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)President Joe Biden on Thursday called Vladimir Putin a \"pure thug\" and \"murderous dictator,\" his latest pointed attack against the Russian President as the war in Ukraine rages on. Speaking at the annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon on St. Patrick's Day at Capitol Hill, Biden said Putin is \"a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.\" And earlier Thursday, in a meeting with Miche√°l Martin, the Taoiseach of Ireland, the President also zeroed in on the Russian leader, saying, \"Putin's brutality and what he's doing and his troops are doing in Ukraine is just inhumane.\" The comments came a day after Biden called Putin a war criminal -- a significant escalation in his rhetoric condemning the Russian leader's actions against Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday Biden's comments were \"absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.\" Also on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's emotional address to Congress. Hours later, Biden laid out new American military assistance to Ukraine, which includes weapons and drones, as well as anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, stopping short of some of Zelensky's requests, such as the implementation of a no-fly zone. Biden on Thursday credited lawmakers at the luncheon for coming together across party lines to pass the assistance package, which was part of a larger spending bill the President signed into law this week. He said the group \"should have more times like this where Democrats, Republicans get together.\" \"We actually not only agree on one thing, but we remind ourselves we actually like each other. It's a useful thing,\" he said. Throughout Thursday's events focused on the holiday, the President emphasized the strength of the relationship between Ireland -- which has never joined NATO -- and the United States, saying during the luncheon that the relationship was \"taking on an even more intense and cooperative forum than it ever has because of Ireland's neutrality.\" Biden said Ireland is \"stepping up\" in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine. \"Ireland and the United States and working together for the first time now,\" Biden said. \"They're on the United Nations Security Council ... and the European Union. And Putin is paying a big price for his aggression, and they are part of the reason the cost is going so high.\" \"Everybody talks about how Germany having stepped up and changed their notions about being more leaning forward, and they have,\" he continued. \"And so has Ireland. A neutral country, Ireland has stepped up, and they're taking the hit for what they're doing.\"",

On Wednesday, the satirical news website posted that story 21 times, filling most of its homepage. Each article referenced a different shooting, with the most recent incident at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas -- where 19 children and two teachers were killed -- at the top. Other articles had datelines for Atlanta, Indianapolis, Boulder, and others. \"UVALDE, TX In the hours following a violent rampage in Texas in which a lone attacker killed at least 21 individuals and injured several others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Tuesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place,\" the most recent article reads. In every story, a different resident says the same quote: \"This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them.\" Jason Roeder, formerly a senior editor at The Onion, first wrote the headline back in 2014, but it has been shared widely across social media following mass shootings in the years since. In 2018, following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he wrote: \"When I wrote this headline, I had no idea it would be applied to the high school a mile from my house.\" Texas has loosened gun laws in recent years, allowing state residents to openly carry guns in public without a permit or training. Beto O'Rourke, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee, confronted Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other officials on Wednesday during a press conference in Uvalde, accusing the governor of inaction. \"The time to stop the next shooting is right now and you are doing nothing,\" he said. \"You said this is not predictable. This is totally predictable.\" The Onion's story about the Uvalde shooting ended with the same closing sentence as the other 21 stories about mass shootings: \"At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as 'helpless.'\"",

The largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the US has stripped Fox Corporation of its status as a preferred LGBTQ friendly employer and released a blistering statement condemning the network for its recent coverage of the LGBTQ community. The move comes as Fox News relentlessly attacks Disney for the company's belated opposition to the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and for the entertainment giant's efforts to incorporate the LGBTQ community into its films and other projects. The right-wing talk network has in recent days portrayed Disney as a \"creepy\" company aiming to sexualize young children and indoctrinate them with a radical LGBTQ agenda. That's not to say all of the commentary has been this explicit or fallen under this umbrella. But the general tenor of the network's coverage has been in this vein. Tucker Carlson, the highest-rated host on the channel, even went so far as to suggest that a Disney executive was exhibiting the behavior of a \"sex offender\" for efforts aimed at representing LGBTQ lifestyles in different projects. That extreme   frankly dark   rhetoric has prompted the Human Rights Campaign to penalize Fox Corp.'s score on its Corporate Equality Index, a status that companies often work hard to achieve. In fact, Fox Corp. previously boasted that it had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign as one of the \"best places to work for LGBTQ equality.\" \"I can confirm that Fox Corporation no longer has a score of 100 on the Corporate Equality Index,\" Human Rights Campaign spox Aryn Fields told me on Friday. Fox was notified of the Human Rights Campaign's decision via email early Friday afternoon... \"Enough is enough\" In explaining the decision to strip Fox of its status, the Human Rights Campaign issued a scathing statement. \"Fox News has a history of sharing misinformation and disinformation about the LGBTQ+ community,\" Fields said. \"We know from our own research, which we put out earlier this week, what their disinformation and misinformation means for the LGBTQ+ community: perpetuating stigma and marginalization of transgender and non-binary people. At a time when transgender people -- especially transgender children -- are under attack in statehouses across the country, rhetoric has real consequences.\" \"We can no longer allow Fox Corporation to maintain its score if Fox News personalities and contributors continue to deny the existence of transgender people, minimize the violence transgender individuals face, refer to parents of LGBTQ+ youth as perverts, or equate leaders of LGBTQ+ diversity and inclusions efforts with sex offenders,\" Fields added. \"Each of these actions happened in the last 72 hours. Enough is enough.\" Fox's response Fox Corp. is not commenting on the matter. But a Fox News spokesperson pointed out that the network just hired Caitlyn Jenner as a contributor this week. The Fox News spokesperson also pointed to the benefits that the company offers members of the LGBTQ community...",

        "input": "Atlanta (CNN)Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and former Sen. David Perdue clashed over the results of the 2020 election during the state's GOP governor's debate Sunday night, blaming each other for Democratic gains in the last election cycle. It marked the first primary debate between Perdue, whose most prominent supporter is former President Donald Trump, and Kemp, who the former President says betrayed him for refusing to help him overturn his defeat in 2020 and whom he has set out to dethrone. While there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in any state during the 2020 election, Perdue returned to the subject -- a central theme of his campaign -- several times throughout the hourlong debate and argued that Kemp did not do enough to challenge the state's election results. Perdue was defeated by Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia's Senate election, and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock won the special election for the state's other Senate seat, giving Democrats a majority in the chamber. Their wins in the January 2021 runoffs, paired with President Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the Peach State, made Georgia central to Republican efforts to challenge the election. Trump has endorsed and vigorously supported Perdue in an attempt to get back at Kemp for refusing to help him overturn his defeat in 2020. Kemp said in response to Perdue's line of attack Sunday that he had no authority to challenge the election results, and he took repeated shots at Perdue's loss to Ossoff. \"I was secretary of state for eight years, and I don't need to be lectured by someone who lost his last election,\" he said. The Georgia governor also defended himself as best positioned to defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams in November, promising to make sure she is \"never your governor and your next president.\" \"There's only person who's beaten Stacey Abrams, and that's me,\" Kemp said, referring to his first campaign for governor in 2018 when he narrowly defeated Abrams. But Perdue remained focused on relitigating  Kemp's handling of the 2020 election. \"The only reason I'm not in the United States Senate is because you caved in and gave the elections to Stacey and to the liberal Democrats in 2020,\" he said. Perdue accused Kemp of passing the blame onto others and said that made him a \"weak\" leader. Kemp immediately returned the attack. \"Weak leaders blame everybody else for their own losses instead of blaming themselves,\" he said. Speaking to CNN following the debate, Perdue said he exposed a \"weak governor.\" Kemp, meanwhile, declined to answer CNN's questions as he left the debate site at WSB-TV's studio in midtown Atlanta.",

Five of the seven deaths at the warehouse shelter were considered storm-related, state health officials said. In total, more than 800 residents were taken to the facility ahead of the storm. A joint investigation by the attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) and the Louisiana Bureau of Investigations (LBI) \"revealed Dean refused to move his residents out of the warehouse following Hurricane Ida, billed Medicaid for dates his residents were not receiving proper care, and engaged in conduct intended to intimidate or obstruct public health officials and law enforcement,\" the AG's news release said. Dean's attorney, John McClindon, told CNN Wednesday Dean plans to plead not guilty to all charges he's facing and said Dean's mental health will factor into the case. \"I don't think it's any secret that Bob's mental health is going to be an issue in this case,\" McClindon said. \"Bob clearly has some cognitive impairments and did on the day of this incident.\" McClindon said Landry informed him of an arrest warrant for Dean Monday and his client flew from Georgia to self-surrender. He made an initial court appearance in Louisiana Wednesday and was released on $350,000 bond, McClindon said. McClindon called the charges \"very defensible\" and said \"the evidence will bear out eventually.\" Residents kept in 'unsafe, unsanitary, and unhealthy' conditions, officials said The nursing home residents were taken to the warehouse in Independence, about 57 miles east of Baton Rouge, ahead of Hurricane Ida's landfall on August 29. The state health department said it soon started to hear about deteriorating conditions at the warehouse. CNN obtained the logs of 61 calls from the warehouse to 911 operators. At least 30 of the calls asked for assistance with medical episodes before and after landfall, including calls for seizures, stopped breathing, and one instance in which a caller says a diabetic patient needed transport because they had \"not eaten due to them having no more supplies.\" \"Let's be clear; there is no emergency-preparedness plan that allows for residents to be kept in such an unsafe, unsanitary, and unhealthy condition,\" Stephen Russo, director of legal, audit and regulatory affairs for the health department, said last year. \"The lack of adequate care for these residents is inhumane, and goes against the rules, regulations, and applicable statutes.\" The seven facilities involved had their licenses revoked and cannot repatriate or admit residents, officials said at the time. The homes also had their Medicaid provider agreements terminated, the health department said. The Attorney General's Office investigation is ongoing and additional legal action may be filed in the future, the Wednesday release said. The next court date for Dean has not been set, but McClindon said it will most likely happen in the next 60 days.",

        "input": "(CNN)Pete Arredondo, the Uvalde school district police chief who was the incident commander during the Robb Elementary school shooting, was sworn in as a city council member on Tuesday. \"Out of respect for the families who buried their children today, and who are planning to bury their children in the next few days, no ceremony was held,\" Mayor Don McLaughlin said in a statement. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the attack last Tuesday. The chief was identified last week by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) as the person who decided not to breach the school classroom where the shooter had holed up and instead stand back and wait for reinforcements. Though DPS Director Steven McCraw did not identify Arredondo by name, he said the chief made the \"wrong decision\" not to engage with the gunman sooner. The mayor originally said Monday that the special city council meeting \"will not take place as scheduled, adding \"our focus on Tuesday is on our families who lost loved ones.\" Although there was no formal ceremony, McLaughlin said that members of the council came to City Hall \"at their convenience\" during the day to be sworn in, adding that Arredondo did appear in person to receive the oath and sign paperwork. Arredondo was elected to the council earlier this month. In his Monday statement, the mayor said Arredondo was \"duly elected\" and that there is \"nothing in the City Charter, Election Code, or Texas Constitution that prohibits him from taking the oath of office. To our knowledge, we are currently not aware of any investigation of Mr. Arredondo.\" No response to follow-up interview request The law enforcement response -- and the chief's decision not to confront the shooter -- has come under fire as new details of the tragedy emerge, including that terrified students called 911 from inside the class begging for help while officers stood in the hallway. On Sunday, the Justice Department announced it will conduct a review of the law enforcement response to the shooting at the mayor's request. Meanwhile, the DPS said Tuesday that Arredondo has not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the massacre. The school's police department and the Uvalde police department are \"still cooperating,\" but there has not been a recent response from Arredondo to a request for another interview with investigators, DPS spokesperson Travis Considine told CNN. As of Tuesday night, Arredondo had not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment and had Arredondo has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment. He has not spoken about the shooting publicly since two brief press statements on the day of the attack, in which he said the gunman was dead but provided little information on the shooting, citing the ongoing investigation and taking no questions. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that he wants a full accounting of what happened but added that he has no say in whether the school district's police chief should be fired. \"As far as his employment status is concerned, that's something that is beyond my control and I have no knowledge about,\" the governor said, adding, \"Every act of all of those officials will be known and identified and explained to the public.\" Arredondo has nearly three decades of law enforcement experience, according to the school district. A board of trustees for the district approved Arredondo to head the department in 2020. The district's superintendent, Hal Harrell, said in a Facebook post at the time the board was \"confident with our selection and impressed with his experience, knowledge, and community involvement.\" Arredondo previously served as a captain at a school district police department in Laredo, Texas, and in multiple roles at the Uvalde Police Department.",

        "input": "Washington (CNN)US Rep. Karen Bass, a longtime Democratic lawmaker who was on President Joe Biden's short list for a running mate during the 2020 campaign, could make history in California. The Los Angeles mayor's race has pitted Bass against real estate developer Rick Caruso in a runoff to replace term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti, CNN projects. If elected, Bass would become the first woman and the first Black woman to lead America's second-largest city. Bass served in the California State Assembly prior to her time in Congress. In 2008, she made history as the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature, according to her congressional biography. The six-term congresswoman currently represents California's 37th District. She has championed efforts to shape public policy in areas such as child welfare, foster care and prison reform. She chaired the Congressional Black Caucus for two years and helped to lead policing overhaul efforts after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in 2020. Though Biden ultimately selected Kamala Harris as his ticket mate, his consideration of Bass threw her name into the national spotlight. Bass has the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat, in the mayoral race. Bass has forged a coalition of White progressives and Black voters and has sought to expand on that by engaging Latino voters and other groups across the city. In her campaign, she's emphasized the depth of her policy experience and her reputation as collaborative listener and legislator. She's highlighted her early work as a physician assistant in the emergency room and her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South LA in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic through the nonprofit she founded, Community Coalition. She has also pointed to her role as a dealmaker when she led the California State Assembly after the 2008 financial crisis -- making budget decisions that earned her a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2010. Bass and Caruso had headed into Election Day as the likely top-two vote getters. The race now won't be decided until November, with neither Caruso nor Bass able to win more than 50% of the vote Tuesday night. Caruso, a former Republican and billionaire who has spent more than $40 million driving his tough-on-crime message, had been accused by Bass and other rivals of trying to \"buy\" the office. \"I don't care how much money you spend, it's the power of the people that win,\" Bass said through a megaphone during one of her campaign stops Tuesday evening. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

Officers responded to reports of a man carrying a firearm and \"there was an interaction\" between officers and the man, according to the Special Investigations Unit in the Canadian province of Ontario. At some point during the interaction, two officers shot at the suspect, hitting him at least once, police said. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. At least four schools in the area were under lockdown Thursday as authorities tried to determine the extent of the threat, according to a series of tweets from the Toronto District School Board. The incident comes as the US is grappling with the shock of two recent mass shootings: its deadliest school shooting in nearly a decade in Uvalde, Texas, and a racist shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. \"We certainly understand the trauma and how traumatic this must have been for staff, students and parents given the two recent events that have happened in the United States,\" said Toronto Police Chief James Ramer at a news briefing after the incident, referencing the Uvalde and Buffalo shootings. He added that he understands the community's concern as the armed suspected was very close to schools. The schools under lockdown included William G. Davis Junior Public School, Joseph Howe Senior Public School, Charlottetown Junior Public School and Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute, according to a tweet from the school board. \"I was really scared, I just started praying,\" one student told CNN affiliate CTV. Ontario's Special Investigations Unit is now investigating the fatal shooting, according to a news release. \"Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case,\" the release said. Ontario premier Doug Ford tweeted his thanks to police and emergency services for their \"quick action.\" \"Thank you to police and emergency services for your quick action today in Scarborough,\" he said. \"We're extremely grateful for everything you do to keep our communities safe.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)Donald Trump said and did a whole lot of things on and around January 6, 2021, as he sought to use the levers of government to push his false election fraud schemes and remain in power. None was more damning than a quote that re-surfaced during the latest public hearing of the House select committee investigating January 6 on Thursday. It came from an extended phone call between Trump, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue in December 2020. The call, according to Donoghue, who took contemporaneous notes, featured the then-President repeatedly pressing the top Justice Department officials over a variety of false and conspiratorial claims about the election -- all of which Donoghue shot down. At some point during the call, Trump appears to grow exasperated. He implored Rosen and Donoghue to \"just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,\" Donoghue testified Thursday. Yeah. Think about that for a minute. This is not the first time we have heard that line. CNN reported on the existence of Donoghue's notes -- and the Trump quote therein -- in July 2021. But in the context of the case being made by the January 6 committee, the quote is absolutely stunning and deeply revealing. Consider, first, the brazenness exhibited by Trump here. He is asking the two highest-ranking officials of the Justice Department at the time, who have already repeatedly made clear to him on the same call that his claims of election fraud are spurious, to just say that there was fraud -- and be done with it. Second, the quote reveals -- or, in truth, re-reveals -- the utter misunderstanding (and contempt) that Trump had for the Department of Justice. Time and time again, from the very early days of his time in office, Trump publicly expressed his frustrations that the DOJ would not simply do his bidding. Trump repeatedly wondered -- via his Twitter feed and his own public comments -- why his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election. In an interview with Fox in August 2018, Trump asked, \"What kind of man is this?\" of Sessions, adding that he \"never took control of the Justice Department.\" Trump fired Sessions on the day after the 2018 election. Despite hand-picking Sessions' successor, Bill Barr, Trump still complained the probe, led by special counsel John Durham, designed to look into the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation was not moving quickly enough. \"If that's the case I think it's terrible,\" Trump told conservative radio show Rush Limbaugh in October 2020 when asked about the possibility that the Durham probe might not be released until after the election. \"It's very disappointing. And I'll tell [Barr] to his face. I think it's a disgrace. It's an embarrassment.\" (Worth noting: It wasn't just the Department of Justice where Trump seemed to fundamentally misunderstand his power over them. He repeatedly referred to \"my generals\" and \"my military.\") The third thing the quote reveals is that Trump didn't really care -- in any meaningful way -- whether or not there was actual election corruption. Remember that in the same phone call where Trump asks Rosen and Donoghue to \"just say the election was corrupt,\" he had told that the various claims he was making about election fraud were false. All Trump cared about was using the imprimatur of the Justice Department as a shield by which he could then steer perception in favor of his election lies. In short: He knew what he was saying wasn't born out by the facts. He didn't care. He just wanted the DOJ to say \"corrupt\" so that he could meld and shape that for his own goal: staying in office no matter what. It's not clear yet whether the committee will recommend criminal charges at the end of all of this. Or whether the DOJ will charge Trump -- or anyone else -- in connection with their activities on January 6. But what is clear is that Trump viewed the Justice Department as just another arm by which to carry out his agenda. He never knew or cared about the independence of DOJ, or why that was (and is) critical to the health of American democracy.",

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)Kohl's is under intense pressure from Wall Street raiders and up against stiff competition from Amazon, Target and others. Now it's hoping that overhauling its brand image can beat back those threats. Kohl's (KSS) announced plans Monday to add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1,100 US stores, open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl's Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases, up from 5%. Kohl's also unveiled new strategies to grow online, including self-service for pickup orders and returns. The approaches are part of a larger attempt to change how consumers see the Kohl's brand amid a department store sector that's been in decline for years. Traditional chains such as Sears, JCPenney and others have been forced into bankruptcy, prompting Kohl's to search for new ways to connect with shoppers. Kohl's has lost 17% of its market share since 2011, primarily to discount stores such as TJ Maxx, Amazon and rival clothing brands, according to UBS analyst Jay Sole. \"We're evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle,\" Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass said in a presentation to investors Monday. Consumers were dressing down long before the pandemic hit, ditching traditional office wear for denim and sneakers, and Kohl's had been expanding its selection of activewear and casual brands in response. Remote work during the pandemic sped up this wardrobe trend. Kohl's believes it has an opportunity to reinvent itself as a leader in this growing market, and plans to add more fitness, athleisure and denim goods. \"This creates big opportunities for Kohl's. We expect these trends will live on well into the future,\" Gass added. Market reaction Wall Street isn't convinced Kohl's can pull it off. Shares tumbled 13% Monday and were flat in Tuesday morning trading. Activist investors on Wall Street have been circling Kohl's for months, arguing that the chain has underperformed competitors and should consider spinning off its e-commerce business or going private. Kohl's has so far rejected calls for a spinoff or seeking a buyout offer. The company is betting that this new approach can keep activists at bay. \"We are a strong company,\" Gass said. \"We're reinventing the brand to be more relevant.\"",

There's nothing anybody can do to stop this hate,\" she said, in a video posted to her Instagram stories. \"The thing that bothers me is ... this feeling of like, I just gotta shut up and take it, I just have to grin and bear it. And I'm not built like that,\" she continued. \"Thank you to the people who show up for me in the comments and in the places that I'm not going to put myself. And to the rest of y'all, y'all weird.\" Ingram's experiences following her \"Star Wars\" debut have become a trend -- actors John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran have also been vocal about the racist hate they received after appearing in the \"Star Wars\" movies. Tran, the first woman of color to have a major role in a \"Star Wars\" film, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about the harassment she received after starring in 2017's \"The Last Jedi.\" The hate become so intense that Tran left social media and spent time in therapy. Even earlier, in 2014, Boyega's appearance in the trailer for \"The Force Awakens\" began a whole social media movement of #BlackStormtrooper, after many reacted to his casting with suspicion and racist remarks.",

        "input": "(CNN)Phil Mickelson is set to miss the Masters for the first time in 28 years after being removed from the tournament's list of active golfers. The six-time major winner, who won the last of his three Masters green jackets in 2010, said last month he would take \"some time away\" from golf after being criticized for comments he made about Saudi Arabia's regime and the country's proposed new tour. Mickelson has been officially listed as a \"past champion not playing\" on the Masters website. At the end of February, the 51-year-old apologized for his comments on the reported Saudi-backed breakaway golf tour, saying they were off the record -- a claim the reporter who interviewed him has denied -- and shared out of context and without his consent. The Saudi-backed golf league is a proposed venture that is attempting to attract golfers away from the sport's main tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- with offers of big money. Mickelson was quoted from a 2021 interview with author Alan Shipnuck for his book, \"Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf's Most Colorful Superstar,\" as saying that he would consider joining the proposed Super League because it is a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.\" The American is further quoted as saying that \"Saudi money has finally given us (players) that leverage\" to be able to change things about the PGA. Shipnuck quoted Mickelson as saying disparaging things about Saudi Arabia's human rights record and asserting that the kingdom killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mickelson apologized for his \"reckless\" comments and said he would be taking a break from golf to \"prioritize the ones I love most and work on being the man I want to be.\" A number of high-profile golfers, including Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau, have reiterated their commitment to the PGA Tour since his comments, with Mickelson also losing a number of sponsors. The Masters gets underway on April 7 with Hideki Matsuyama as defending champion.",

        "input": "(CNN)There's been a debate for much of the last few months as to when we really will know that the Covid-19 pandemic is over. The answer, at least in political terms, is March 25, when Hawaii will become the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. \"It's taken the entire community to get to this point -- with lowered case counts and hospitalizations,\" said Hawaii Gov. David Ige in a tweet announcing the decision. While Ige also said he would consider reinstituting the mask policy \"if needed,\" it's very hard to imagine Hawaii -- or any other state -- going back to a mandatory masking policy. What's remarkable is the pace with which states -- those led by Republican governors, but also those with Democratic governors -- started to drop their mask mandates after an Omicron-fueled surge in cases this winter. Last month, many states that still had indoor mask mandates began announcing they would end the policies, in some cases even before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its national masking guidance. California Gov. Gavin Newsom very publicly declared that his state was moving to the \"next phase\" of dealing with Covid-19 in mid-February. \"We have all come to understand what was not understood at the beginning of this crisis, that there is no end date, that there is not a moment where we declare victory,\" Newsom said in announcing the plan to treat the virus as endemic rather than a pandemic. That rush among even Democratic governors to drop mask mandates reflects, yes, the drastically lower case numbers. But it is also proof that even for those most tolerant and supportive of mask-wearing, patience has run out. In Axios-Ipsos polling late last month, 62% of Americans said they were wearing masks at least sometimes when leaving home. As recently as January, that number was 73%. (The highest the number ever went was 92% in December 2020/January 2021.) In the third year of Covid-19, people are done with it -- and acting accordingly. Given that, it's hard to imagine any politician -- no matter their party -- insisting on another mask mandate, even if cases do surge at some point. The Point: Over the past two years, masks became the biggest symbol of not just our battle against the virus, but also our own political views. Now it seems everyone agrees that it's time to take them off -- for good.",

        "input": "(CNN)Since the US Supreme Court was established in 1789, 115 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men. Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, would help broaden the diversity of the court. Jackson, who is African American, would succeed justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring at the end of the court's term. Breyer is White. Confirmation hearings for Jackson, who sits on DC's federal appellate court, began Monday. In recent decades the court has become more diverse. Almost half of its justices since 1990 have been women or minorities. But for most of its history, the nation's highest court has looked like a chummy private men's club from a not-so-distant time. Here's how the demographics of the Supreme Court have stacked up since its beginning. Five have been women Of the 115 justices, 110 -- or 95.6% -- have been men. For almost 200 years, every single Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan pledged as a presidential candidate that he'd put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office in 1981 he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O'Connor. Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts, but no one gave serious thought publicly to putting one on the Supreme Court. President Harry Truman considered nominating a woman, but the justices at the time feared a woman's presence on the court \"would inhibit their conference deliberations.\" Bill Clinton made the second female appointment by nominating Ginsburg in 1993. Barack Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, followed by Elena Kagan a year later. Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 after Ginsburg's death. Sotomayor, Kagan and Barrett remain on the current court. Three have been people of color Only two African American justices, Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, have served on the court so far. The first appointment -- when Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall -- wasn't until 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. Thomas's appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H. W. Bush (the first Bush). Ketanji Brown Jackson would become the court's third Black justice -- and its first Black woman. Sotomayor, one of the five female justices, is also the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn't qualify under current US census standards.) No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander. 7 percent have been Jewish At its founding, the court was made up of almost entirely Protestant members, and a majority of the 115 justices throughout history have been Protestants. Today's court is more diverse when it comes to religion. We've never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including current justices Kagan and Breyer. The current court also has six Catholics. Neil Gorsuch, who Trump nominated in 2017, was raised Catholic but now worships at an Episcopal church. There has never been a Muslim justice on the Supreme Court. None have identified as anything other than heterosexual No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight. There have been speculations surrounding a few former justices who were lifelong bachelors, but there's no evidence any of them were gay. Why having a diverse court matters The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases. It's laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation's population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs. Sometimes the court hears cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom identified as gay. In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity. \"A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,\" she said. This is an updated version of a story that was first published in 2018.",

        "input": "(CNN)US federal prosecutors are suing a New York town, alleging gender discrimination and sexual harassment against a former firefighter, according to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, prosecutors allege that the Town of Harrison and its fire department \"unlawfully discriminated against a female firefighter by creating a hostile work environment and terminating her employment after she reported that a male senior firefighter had harassed and stalked her,\" a press release from the U.S. Attorney's office states. Former firefighter Angela Bommarito joined the Harrison Fire Department in 2015 where prosecutors allege senior firefighter Henry Mohr stalked, harassed her, and called her a \"whore\" and \"bitch\" in front of their colleagues after she tried to end a sexual relationship with him. When she reported his behavior to town and fire department officials, no adequate investigation occurred, prosecutors allege. Prosecutors say Bommarito subsequently filed a complaint against Mohr with the Harrison Police Department after his alleged stalking and harassment continued, but allege that the Police Chief \"devised a plan where in his own words, he would \"broker a deal with the Town to make sure this whole thing dies.\" \"In an interaction that was recorded, the Police Chief explained how he intended to get a \"guarantee\" from the leadership of Harrison that there would be no discipline or adverse action taken against Mohr,\" the complaint states. Prosecutors also allege that there was also no employment action taken against Mohr after Bommarito had a meeting with Harrison's Personnel Manager and an attorney representing the town. Prosecutors also said Bommarito was also coerced into signing a resignation letter by the Police Chief, and was not permitted to withdraw it when she tried. After Bommarito left the fire department, Mohr allegedly continued to stalk and harass her. While he was eventually arrested and prosecuted, and pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment, Mohr remains a firefighter with the Harrison Fire Department to this day, according to the lawsuit. CNN has reached out to the Town of Harrison and has attempted to reach Henry Mohr for comment. The Harrison Fire Department declined to comment when reached by CNN. According to the Department of Justice, Bommarito has suffered monetary damages, humiliation, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the actions of Mohr and Harrison town officials. Federal prosecutors are asking the court to prohibit the town and its departments from engaging in gender discrimination, order them to take appropriate action in response to employee complaints of sexual harassment and discrimination, order them to implement appropriate policies and programs designed to prevent future sexual harassment in the fire department and to prevent retaliation, and provide \"sufficient remedial relief\" and \"compensatory damages\" for alleged treatment she endured, the complaint states.",

        "input": "(CNN)Karim Benzema scored an extra-time winner to complete a dramatic comeback for Real Madrid against Sevilla to win 3-2 at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium on Sunday, edging closer to its 35th La Liga victory. Sevilla achieved an early lead within the first 21 minutes of the match thanks to Ivan Rakiti, who scored a fortuitous free kick that slid through the Madrid barrier. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois failed to clear the ball barely four minutes later, letting Sevilla add to its tally with a strike from Erik Lamela -- who pounced on the deflection to capitalize. The host was 2-0 up going into the second half, but Madrid showed signs of breaking Sevilla's momentum with a cleared attempt from star forward Benzema. Los Blancos managed to finally break through in the 50th minute, when substitute Rodrygo got into the box and got on the end of a cross from defender Dani Carvajal. Despite a questionable disallowed goal from Vinicius Jr. due to a handball ruling from the video assistant referee (VAR), Madrid leveled the match with a superb finish from Nacho Fernandez in the 82nd minute in the box from a Carvajal pass. The match seemed set for a draw when yet another moment of late-game Madrid magic occurred. Benzema laid the ball off for Rodrygo in the 92nd minute, who drove along the right side of the box and passed it back to the Frenchman who controlled it, took two touches and smashed the ball through four Sevilla bodies to seal the comeback for Real. It was Benzema's 25th league goal this season and his 39th goal in 39 games on the year. It also marks the second late game-winner he has scored in the past week after his 96th-minute goal against Chelsea sent Madrid through to the Champions League semifinals on April 12. Not without controversies A series of VAR-related controversies added drama to an already supercharged game. Alongside Vinicius Jr's disallowed goal, the referee decided not to give the Merengues a penalty for what appeared to be a handball by Sevilla defender Diego Carlos. Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga also managed to dodge a clear second yellow card for a clumsy tackle on Anthony Martial. Speaking on the handball incident, Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said, \"I saw it live and it didn't look like it touched his hand. I just don't get it. It's tough to assess these situations but ... this move looked pretty clear to me. \"In the first half, we looked like a tired team and then the intensity in the second half was amazing. Sometimes in football, you can't put your finger on these things. I also don't understand the interpretation of Diego Carlos' handball and Vinicius' handball.\" 'These are things only Real Madrid are capable of doing' Madrid are now 15 points clear of Sevilla, Barcelona -- who have two games in hand -- and Atletico Madrid in second place on 60 points. \"We head away with an incredible feeling, we always fight until the end. We knew this would be a very difficult game, but I'm thrilled to have got on in the second half, scored a goal and provide an assist to help my team,\" Rodrygo said. \"The coach told us to play a bit more because we struggled in the first half and they were better than us. These are things only Real Madrid is capable of doing. I'm incredibly proud to be part of this team and to be involved in these comebacks.\" \"It's sad today, we had a great first half, but you can't allow Real Madrid any way back into the game,\" Sevilla midfielder Rakiti told reporters after the match. \"If you don't score your clear chances, then this can happen.\" There were a flurry of nail-biting league matches across the board on Sunday, as relegation-threatened Levante smashed Granada 4-1 at the Nuevo Estadio de Los Carmenes. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid won 2-1 against Espanyol with a late penalty from Yannick Carrasco in stoppage time, and Celta Vigo earned a decisive 2-0 victory against Athletic Bilbao. Madrid faces Osasuna in its next league match on Wednesday, while Sevilla will play Levante on Thursday.",

It's come at a cost, with as many as a third of global populations in danger of extinction and 80 species already extinct, according to the 2021 WWF report \"The World's Forgotten Fishes.\" This is having an impact on both nature and humans. Freshwater fish provide food for 200 million people and livelihoods for 60 million, the report says -- and we depend on river ecosystems for water, sanitation and power. \"Rivers are the arteries of our planet,\" says South African freshwater conservation biologist and photographer Jeremy Shelton. \"They transport cool clean water from the mountains down across landscapes and give us this critical resource that we rely on so heavily for drinking, for farming, for industry.\" Shelton, a researcher at the Freshwater Research Centre in South Africa, became enchanted by river ecosystems as a child, when he splashed about in a small stream behind his family home. But realizing that others were less enthralled by the murky depths, he later picked up his camera, aiming to showcase the rich diversity of freshwater life, and warn of its fragility. \"It's all about inspiring people to become more aware of the natural world around them and once that connection is forged, to change the way they behave, the way they act, the way they connect with that life around them,\" Shelton tells CNN. His images were featured in the WWF report on freshwater fish and have been shared widely on Instagram, including by activist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

Freshwater fish are the most threatened species group in South Africa and wetlands and rivers are under more pressure than any other ecosystem, according to the 2018 national biodiversity assessment. The report notes that half of South Africa's freshwater fish species are found nowhere else in the world, so conservation strategies to prevent population decline and minimize threats such as habitat degradation and predatory invasive species are much needed. \"I'm witness to this widespread deterioration of freshwater ecosystems all around me, and I'm really driven by the opportunity to be able to work on conserving some of these systems,\" says Shelton. He is involved in a number of freshwater conservation projects, such as the Cape Critical Rivers project, which is focused on preserving threatened species like the Clanwilliam sandfish and the Barrydale redfin, and outdoor learning projects that aim to connect young people with river ecosystems. But Shelton believes that images have the power to reach beyond borders and communicate on a global scale the beauty of nature and the crisis in biodiversity.

Now a whisky distillery is throwing them a lifeline \"Through these images and through the science that goes with them, (I want) to open up people's minds to the beauty and the fragility of life beneath the surface of our rivers and our wetlands,\" he says. \"I'm hoping that through connecting with these previously unseen worlds, people will treat them a little bit more gently, and that people will be a little bit more thoughtful about the way we live our lives and about the way we interact with these natural ecosystems.\"",

Quinta Brunson, the show's creator and star, said many have asked her to address school shootings, and she responded with a firm \"No.\" \"wild how many people have asked for a school shooting episode of the show I write. people are that deeply removed from demanding more from the politicians they've elected and are instead demanding 'entertainment,'\" Brunson wrote Wednesday on Twitter. \"I can't ask 'are yall ok' anymore because the answer is 'no.'\" Brunson posted a screenshot of one direct message she received. The sender argued an episode like that would show government officials why certain gun laws should pass. But the show didn't run for office, Brunson said. \"please use that energy to ask your elected official to get on Beto time and nothing less,\" she said, referring to Beto O'Rourke, the former presidential candidate turned Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee looking to unseat GOP Gov. Greg Abbott. O'Rourke has been a vocal advocate for greater gun control, confronting Abbott over the matter during a Wednesday press conference. \"I don't want to sound mean, but I want people to understand the flaw in asking for something like this,\" she continued. \"we're not okay. this country is rotting our brains. im sad about it.\" On Tuesday, an 18-year-old opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas -- killing 19 children and two adults. The incident, closely preceded by high profile mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and California, has sparked widespread grief and outrage over continued inaction against gun violence.",

        "input": "(CNN)The World Health Organization (WHO) said Sunday it is concerned the war in Ukraine could worsen the Covid-19 pandemic, and it is trying to do more to limit the spread of infectious diseases. Cases in the region are down from the previous week, but there's significant risk there will be more severe disease and death due to low vaccination rates in Ukraine, as well as among the more than two million who've fled the country to surrounding areas, regions also with  low vaccination rates. Ukraine's Covid-19 vaccination rate is around 34%, while neighboring Moldova's is around 29%, according to Our World In Data. There have been a total of 791,021 new cases of Covid-19 and 8,012 new deaths in Ukraine and in surrounding countries between March 3 and 9, a WHO situation report published Sunday said. \"Unfortunately, this virus will take opportunities to continue to spread,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, during a Wednesday news briefing. \"We as an organization recognize that countries are in very different situations; they're facing different challenges. There's a lot of movement and refugees associated with this crisis.\" Also on Wednesday, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program, said there will be a rise in Covid-19 in Ukraine, \"without a doubt.\" He attributed the predicted increase to lack of testing, halted vaccinations, and a stressed, war-weary population with already low vaccination rates. Ryan added the world should avoid stereotypes around refugees and disease. \"Let us be very careful with our rhetoric because this always arises,\" he said, \"that in some way people fleeing the horrors of war are going to bring stuff with them. Europe has plenty of Covid as it stands, and it has got to deal with that, and Ukrainian refugees are not going to change the dial on that.\" Sunday's report said the WHO has purchased therapeutics for Covid-19 and is recommending vaccination campaigns and enhanced surveillance for Covid-19 and other infectious diseases. Hungary is providing Ukrainian refugees with free Covid-19 vaccines, and the WHO has also offered lab support that includes Covid-19 testing. The Romanian ministry of health has sent medical teams to test and give Covid-19 vaccines to Ukrainians who have fled their country. Covid-19 treatment is provided free of charge in Slovakia. Covid-19 vaccinations are also free in Moldova for Ukrainians, with its ministry of health testing and monitoring Covid-19, among other diseases. In a joint statement with UNICEF and UNFPA, the WHO called for an end to attacks on Ukraine's health care systems. As of Sunday, there had been 31 verified attacks on health care facilities, with more suspected. \"Humanitarian partners and health care workers must be able to safely maintain and strengthen essential health service delivery, including immunization against Covid-19 and polio, and the supply of life-saving medicines for civilians across Ukraine as well as to refugees crossing into neighboring countries,\" the WHO statement said. \"Health services should be systematically available at border crossings, including rapid care and referral processes for children and pregnant women.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)Alleged rioter Dustin Thompson took the stand in his trial on Wednesday and told a Washington, DC, jury that he believed he had received \"presidential orders\" to go to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \"Besides being ordered by the President to go to the Capitol, I don't know what I was thinking,\" Thompson told the jury. \"I was caught up in the moment.\" Thompson has contested almost none of what the government alleged he did at the Capitol: breaking into the Senate parliamentarian's office twice, stealing a bottle of bourbon and a coat rack, watching one of the most violent scenes of the riot unfold and then fleeing from a Capitol Police officer attempting to question to him. Instead, Thompson has claimed that he believed he was acting at the behest of then-President Donald Trump, who told the crowd at a rally that afternoon to march to the Capitol and \"fight like hell.\" The trial is a major test of that defense, which dozens of riot suspects have adopted so far, and could influence how others argue in court. Thompson's defense lawyer had previously asked Judge Reggie Walton, who is presiding over the case, for permission to ask the former President to testify during the trial. Walton denied that request, saying, \"I don't think we want individuals to feel they can listen to anybody and go out and commit a criminal act.\" During his testimony, Thompson said he had been laid off from his job as an exterminator at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he was \"isolated\" and \"stuck at home,\" and eventually \"fell down the rabbit hole\" into online conspiracy theories When Joe Biden took the lead in the 2020 presidential election, Thompson testified, he \"didn't think it was possible\" and believed Trump when the then-President claimed the election had been stolen. Over the subsequent weeks, Thompson's embrace of conspiracy theories grew stronger, he told the jury, and he decided to attend the January 6 rally after Trump tweeted about it. Thompson said he had listened to every speaker during the \"Stop the Steal\" rally that served as a prelude to the riot and that the speakers had relitigated allegations of fraud. Thompson testified that after a year without work, he had felt good when Trump told the crowd they were \"stronger\" and \"smarter\" than anybody. He then went to the Capitol, Thompson said, because he \"felt like I had to do something to gain his respect, his approval.\" Justice Department lawyers sought to undercut Thompson's argument by portraying the 38-year-old defendant as an adult who can make his own decisions. Prosecutor William Dreher asked Thompson whether \"on the morning of January 6, 2021, you got yourself dressed, all by yourself\" and if \"no one told you what to wear?\" \"Yes,\" Thompson responded. He also confirmed he had gotten to court by himself on Wednesday morning. Dreher also argued that Trump wasn't \"standing right there next to\" Thompson when he entered the Capitol, nor did the then-President say during his speech that day that \"it is now legal to steal from the United States Capitol building.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)The Affordable Care Act cost Barack Obama and Democrats dearly. The health care legislation was, without question, at the center of major losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections for the Obama's party. The first midterm of Obama's presidency resulted in Democrats losing the House majority. The second resulted in the loss of the party's Senate majority. (And that's not even dealing with the massive setbacks those two elections delivered to Democrats at the state and local level.) And yet, when Obama comes to the White House on Tuesday for the first time since leaving it more than five years ago, it will be to celebrate, yes, the Affordable Care Act. Obama will join President Joe Biden at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for lunch and an announcement aimed at making health care more affordable for families. What happened between then and now? Put simply: public perception of the ACA changed -- drastically. The Kaiser Family Foundation has been tracking the popularity of the ACA (also known as Obamacare) since April 2010, less than a month after Obama signed it into law. That first poll found that 46% of Americans had an favorable opinion of the law, while 40% saw it in an unfavorable light. That popularity didn't last long. Throughout the mid 2010s, the law was consistently unpopular. In October 2011, 51% viewed it unfavorably, compared to 34% who viewed it favorably. By July 2014, the unfavorable number was at 53% while the favorable number was at  just 37%. During much of this time, Republicans ran on a platform that put repealing and replacing the ACA at its core. Republicans were never quite able to actually make that happen -- and it was never clear what their replacement plan would have been anyway. Then, gradually, something that seemed very odd began to happen: The ACA started to get steadily more popular. By February 2017, 48% of Americans had a favorable opinion of the law, compared to 42% who held an unfavorable view. The law only got more popular from there. By February 2018, 54% saw the law favorably, while 42% saw it unfavorably. In Kaiser's latest polling on the ACA from March, 55% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the law, compared to 42% who saw it unfavorably. (The last time more Americans viewed the law unfavorably than favorably in Kaiser polling was December 2016.) What happened? Well, two things: 1. People got used to the law, which amounted to the largest shakeup in the health care system in decades. Popular features like ending of discrimination based on pre-existing conditions won out. 2. Obama left office. What became clear over the lifespan of polling on the ACA is that it mirrored Obama's approval rating. Obamacare was so knit to the President in the minds of most Americans that however they thought about him largely determined how they thought about the law. And as has been true of every president up until Donald Trump, former presidents get more popular when they leave office. They are in the spotlight less. They aren't always viewed through a purely partisan lens. Their accomplishments become decoupled from the political hurly-burly. All of which means that what the ACA means to the average person today is hugely different than what it meant 12 years ago when Obama signed it into law. And why Obama, who watched the ACA cost him and his party the House and Senate majorities, is coming to the White House Tuesday for a (much delayed) victory lap.",

        "input": "Alleghany Corp, which agreed last month to be acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, was sued on Wednesday by a shareholder who accused the insurance company of making inadequate and misleading disclosures about the $11.6 billion takeover. In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the plaintiff Shiva Stein said Alleghany failed in a proxy statement to adequately explain the financial basis for the \"fairness opinion\" issued by its bankers at Goldman Sachs, which assessed whether the deal was fair to shareholders. Absent additional disclosures, \"plaintiff will be unable to make a fully-informed decision regarding whether to vote in favor of the proposed transaction, and she is thus threatened with irreparable harm,\" the complaint said. Stein wants to block Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) from buying New York-based Alleghany unless more disclosures are made, and also seeks unspecified damages. The New Jersey resident has not argued that the takeover price is too low. Alleghany did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to a similar request. Berkshire is not a defendant. Shareholders like Stein often sue to block corporate mergers when they find the terms unfair or the disclosures too sparse. On April 1, Stein sued Mandiant Inc to block the cybersecurity company's $5.4 billion takeover by Alphabet Inc's Google, also citing an alleged lack of disclosures to support a Goldman fairness opinion. Berkshire agreed on March 21 to pay $848.02 per share for Alleghany, a 25% premium. Goldman's fairness opinion called that price \"fair from a financial point of view\" to Alleghany shareholders. The purchase would expand Berkshire's large portfolio of insurers, including Geico and General Re. It would also reunite Buffett with Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008. The case is Stein v Alleghany Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03057.",

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)The manufacturer of a firearm used in the Robb Elementary School shooting said it will not attend the National Rifle Association convention Friday. \"Daniel Defense is not attending the NRA meeting due to the horrifying tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, where one of our products was criminally misused,\" said Steve Reed, vice president of marketing for Daniel Defense, in a statement. \"We believe this week is not the appropriate time to be promoting our products in Texas at the NRA meeting.\" A gunman fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at the school earlier this week. Investigators found one of the suspect's AR15-style rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school, according Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, who received a briefing from law enforcement. The NRA is set to hold its annual meeting in Houston Friday, the gun lobby's first convention in three years. The organization canceled the previous two meetings because of the Covid pandemic. Top NRA officials and Republican politicians, including former President Donald Trump and NRA head Wayne LaPierre, will address attendees. Gunmakers will also show off their products at an exposition. But Daniel Defense will not be among them. In a statement on its website, the company called Tuesday's school shooting \"evil.\" \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Texas this week,\" the statement said. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and community devastated by this evil act.\" The AR15-style rifle was discovered with suspect, Salvador Ramos, who was fatally shot by a Border Patrol officer. State Sen. Ronald Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said the guns were bought legally from a federally authorized dealer in the area for Ramos' 18th birthday. Daniel Defense wasn't the only NRA convention participant to pull out. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott canceled his in-person appearance but will address NRA members \"through prerecorded video.\" And at least three musicians who were set to sing in a concert at this weekend's convention have canceled their performances. Don McLean, Larry Gatlin and Larry Stewart cited the shooting in Uvalde as the reason for their cancellations. The NRA condemned the shooting in a statement Wednesday, calling it a \"horrific and evil crime.\" The organization filed for bankruptcy last year after New York Attorney General Letitia James sued to dissolve the NRA. The lawsuit accuses the NRA's senior leadership of using millions of dollars from the organization's reserves for personal use and tax fraud. -- CNN's Paradise Afshar and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report",

        "input": "(CNN)As Elon Musk tweets his way through his pending Twitter acquisition, FX's \"The New York Times Presents\" documentary banner takes a hard look at his flagship business, Tesla, and its long-deferred promise to deliver self-driving car technology with \"Elon Musk's Crash Course.\" Musk didn't cooperate with the filmmakers, who focus on Tesla's safety record, several fatal accidents tied to the technology and perhaps most significantly, Musk's history of repeatedly saying that true self-driving technology is \"two years away,\" illustrated by clips of the CEO moving the goalposts again and again since 2015. In addition, the film premieres as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a new investigation into circumstances surrounding another crash, involving a Tesla in Newport Beach, California, this month. As Times reporter Cade Metz notes, when pressed about the issue Musk has tended to \"double down on it,\" adding that in terms of his public optimism regarding when that space-age concept would become reality, \"It's very easy to say these things. And there's no check on him.\" \"Crash Course\" includes interviews with various regulators as well as former Tesla employees, such as software engineer Raven Jiang, who make the points that self-driving technology was seen as a significant selling point and that it's hard to distinguish Musk's relentless salesmanship from whether he fully believes what he's saying. The producers also feature test drives that demonstrate blind spots in the Autopilot function, including difficulties identifying stationary objects that add to the risk factor. Even with the necessary disclaimers, the term \"self-driving\" evokes certain expectations about the extent to which a person behind the wheel needs to be engaged in its operation, which has muddied the coverage. Musk's high profile and swashbuckling entrepreneurial image have also fed into the romance surrounding the company, with Times reporter Neal Boudette saying, \"Tesla fans hear what they want to hear.\" Tesla has said that it's still the driver's responsibility to pay heed to what the car is doing even while in Autopilot, and that the driver should be ready to take charge in case of problems with the software. But critics suggest that Musk's pronouncements have fueled perceptions that go beyond what Autopilot can currently accomplish, such as an interview in which he's shown saying that self-driving technology will soon offer \"complete autonomy. Safer than a human.\" \"There are too many people who construe the term Autopilot to mean 'Human engagement no longer necessary,'\" says former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart. With Musk very much in the news, \"Crash Course\" offers a window into this inordinately outspoken and controversial billionaire and the corporate culture that he fosters. Yet more urgently, it raises questions about the safety of Tesla owners when they employ Autopilot now, not where they'll be two years from now. \"The New York Times Presents Elon Musk's Crash Course\" premieres May 20 at 10 p.m. ET on FX and Hulu.",

An estimated 35,000 and 40,000 people took to the streets to celebrate UNC's victory Saturday, Chapel Hill officials said in news release. Four people were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. \"This was undoubtedly a monumental victory in what is the biggest rivalry in all of college basketball. Because of that, we experienced one of the largest celebrations in our community's history,\" Chapel Hill town manager Maurice Jones said in the statement. During the celebrations, crews responded to multiple bonfires and some streets were briefly closed, Jones said. After defeating Duke 81-77 in the Final Four, UNC will play Kansas for the national title in New Orleans Monday. The team is looking to win the program's seventh NCAA title, with the last one in 2017. \"While all of us will be cheering Carolina on to its seventh national title, we ask again, that fans who join us on Franklin Street after the game celebrate in a safe and appropriate manner,\" Jones said.",

        "input": "(CNN)Parents of victims and a survivor of the recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, will speak at a hearing held by the US House Oversight Committee on Wednesday about the gun violence epidemic. \"This hearing is ultimately about saving lives, and I hope it will galvanize my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation to do just that,\" Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the committee's  chairwoman, said in a statement. Ahead of the 10 a.m. ET hearing, here is CNN's past coverage of the shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo and an elementary school in Uvalde. What we know about the victims at Robb Elementary School Nineteen children ages 10 and 11 were killed after a gunman opened fire inside a classroom at Robb Elementary School. Fourth grade teachers Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles were also killed in the shooting on May 24. Here's what friends and relatives want everyone to remember about the people they lost. What we know about the Buffalo shooting victims Ten people were killed in a shooting at a Buffalo supermarket last month -- a massacre authorities believe was racially motivated. Thirteen people, ages 20 to 86, were shot. Eleven were Black and two were White, according to Buffalo police. Zeneta Everhart, the mother of one of the survivors, Zaire Goodman, is expected to address the House panel on Wednesday. Goodman, 21, worked at the supermarket and is the only Black person who was shot and survived. Here's how loved ones are remembering those who lost their lives in Buffalo. An 11-year-old survivor of the Uvalde shooting says she smeared blood on herself and played dead Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old survivor of the Uvalde shooting, also is expected to testify before the House committee on Wednesday. She had previously spoken exclusively to CNN about her horrific experience that day inside the classroom where the mass shooting took place. Cerrillo had feared the gunman would come back for her, so she smeared herself with her friend's blood and played dead. She said it felt like three hours that she had lain there, covered in her classmate's blood, with her friends. Lexi Rubio, 10-year-old victim of Uvalde shooting, named to honor roll before gunman took her life Ten-year-old Lexi Rubio had attended an honor roll ceremony with her parents minutes before the gunman opened fire in her classroom and took her life. Her parents, Felix and Kimberly Rubio, are scheduled to appear at Wednesday's congressional hearing. Felix Rubio spoke to CNN's Jason Carroll. Watch the full interview. Buffalo residents mourn loved ones and a community's haven CNN's Alaa Elassar spoke to residents of Buffalo's Masten Park neighborhood about the massacre that shattered their community's haven. \"The beloved Tops is the only supermarket in a 4-mile radius within this largely Black neighborhood and one that took more than a decade to get. It has now been scarred by a deadly rampage whose remnants are evident in the stretches of police tape that now guard the store,\" Elassar writes. \"Tops market was a place of community, a safe space for us to meet, to talk, to be together,\" Phylicia Dove told CNN. \"There's no one here who hasn't visited this Tops. It was ours. Even if it wasn't the best, it was ours, and now our safe space has been infiltrated and taken from us and that is something we are mourning.\" Read the full story. 13 mass shootings over the weekend More than a dozen people were killed and more than 70 wounded in at least 13 mass shootings this past weekend in the US. That included a shooting on Philadelphia's South Street, where at least two people were killed and 11 others hit by gunfire. The country is on pace to match or surpass last year's total of mass shootings, which is the worst on record, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Latest on gun negotiations The two leading Republican senators involved in congressional talks on federal gun legislation said Monday that they are looking at changing the criminal background check system to access juvenile records before gun sales are complete. But they also signaled Monday that it's unlikely Congress will raise the age requirement for purchasing semi-automatic firearms to 21. Negotiators are considering a handful of ideas such as incentivizing states to enact so-called \"red flag\" laws, which allow guns to be temporarily taken away from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others.

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)Wendy's is adding a new Frosty to its lineup   its first new flavor in nearly three years. Beginning Monday, a strawberry Frosty is on US menus for a limited time. Prices for the new Frosty vary by city, and strawberry is temporarily replacing vanilla -  though Wendy's promised that flavor will return following the promotion. Strawberry proved popular when it was added to menus in Canada last year, becoming one of the chain's \"most talked about items\" online, said Wendy's chief marketing officer Carl Loredo in an exclusive interview with CNN Business. That momentum continued in the US, when the strawberry flavor was tested in a few cities. \"The net of it was that we ran out of product halfway through the program because people loved it so much,\" Loredo said. \"It's highly anticipated   I dare say as anticipated¬†as the launch our spicy nuggets.\" It's a notable shift for Wendy's, which doesn't mix up its Frosty flavors as nearly as often as McDonald's (MCD) does with its McFlurry lineup. Strawberry is only the second new flavor added in the US in the past 16 years: Wendy's launched a birthday cake Frosty in 2019 when the chain celebrated its 50th birthday. The vanilla Frosty was added to menus in 2006. Strawberry Frosties aren't the only limited-time item at Wendy's starting Monday. Also returning for the third summer in a row is the Summer Strawberry Chicken salad, which is a blend of freshly sliced strawberries, bacon and grilled chicken served atop a bed of crispy lettuce and spring mix. Fast-food chains are constantly competing for customers' dollars and attention, and specialty offerings are a way to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. For example, McDonald's (MCD) regularly bolsters its menu with new options, including a recently added Chocolatey Pretzel McFlurry. Like other chains, Wendy's has been hit hard by higher commodity and labor costs, with its margins slimming as a result. In the first quarter, global sales at Wendy's restaurants open at least 15 months grew 2.4%   lagging behind its competitors. By comparison, McDonald's sales at global restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 11.8%, while Burger King's sales at locations open at least a year grew 10.3%. During a recent analyst call, Wendy's executives said the first-quarter results did not quite meet expectations. \"The first quarter, from a margin point of view, did not fully go with plan,\" said Wendy's CFO Gunther Plosch during a May analyst call. \"We missed sales slightly,\" he said, adding that \"commodity and labor inflation was a little bit higher than what we expected.\" The burger chain is currently exploring a possible sale or merger. Trian Partners, its largest shareholder, recently announced that it is looking to \"enhance shareholder value\" with a potential deal. Shares of Wendy's are down more than 20% so far this year. --CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN)Sirens blare in the distance. Everywhere she looks, there's devastation. Windows are cracked and pieces of wood and building debris lie scattered in the streets. The streets are eerily empty. This is the scene that Ukrainian photographer Valeria Shashenok witnesses every day when she walks down the street in war-torn Chernihiv, Ukraine. Shashenok is taking shelter in an underground bunker with her mother, father and dog \"Tory\" in the northern Ukrainian city. Her close friends have already fled. But instead of wallowing in the destruction around her, Shashenok has turned the war into art. Shashenok is using TikTok to document her daily life. Her videos have gone viral, some getting millions of views. In the video that made her famous, Shashenok dances to \"Che La Luna\" with the caption, \"My typical day in a bomb shelter.\" She uses a heat gun like a hairdryer as her dog hides under a blanket. Her mother cooks over a pot on the floor. In another video, Shashenok stands before a pile of rubble. The caption says, \"Today Putin destroyed one of the old building(s) in my city. It was a cinema that survived World War II.\" Then she shows large windows nearby, the glass shattered on the ground. \"Windows flew out from the force of impact in neighboring houses too.\" In yet another, she shows the bare shelves of grocery a store with the caption: \"If you want to buy food in a supermarket during the war in Ukraine.\" When asked by CNN's Pamela Brown on Sunday why she started posting these videos on Tik Tok, Shashenok said, \"I feel it's like my mission to show people how it looks in real life. That it's real life, and I'm here.\" She continued, \"Many Russian people write me that we are with you. ... In Russia, (there is) a lot of fake news. And most of the people don't believe that in my country we have a war. ... My mission (is) to show (the) whole world that it's happen(ing) now in real life, and you can see now (the) war (o)n Tik Tok.\" Tik Tok announced Sunday that it would suspend some features in Russia in light of the country's new \"fake news\" law penalizing misinformation. But even with growing stardom, Shashenok is worried about the fate of her country. \"Every day I live with a hope that tomorrow war will end, but everything is getting worse.\" Shashenok wrote to CNN's Meanwhile in America on Sunday. On Monday, she wrote to CNN, \"Everyone is scared (for) their life.\" In recent days, hopes for opening up safe evacuation corridors for civilians out of a number of cities, including Chernihiv, have been repeatedly dashed, with Ukraine accusing Russia of attacking escape routes. Like many people in Ukraine, Shashenok's family is hesitant to leave as evidence grows of Russian violence against Ukrainian civilians. Asked by CNN on Monday whether she and her family would attempt to flee during a planned ceasefire, Shashenok said, \"If Russian troops will not kill civilians tomorrow, yes I will go on (the) 9th (of) March.\" Asked again Tuesday, Shashenok said her family had no plans yet to leave the bunker. Even with the fear of encroaching violence from Russia, Shashenok still has big dreams. She told CNN on Monday that Tik Tok is her future now. \"Maybe I (can) come to (the) United Stated and work like a Tik Tok journalist,\" she said. Hope for a new life and a new beginning is what keeps Shashenok going. \"People need to value freedom. It's the most important (thing) we have.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)Global leaders and defense officials had spent weeks speculating what Russian President Vladimir Putin might reveal about his Ukraine plans in a speech at Russia's Victory Day commemorations Monday. They'll have to keep guessing -- the leader offered few clues on the direction of the conflict. UK defense chief Ben Wallace had suggested that Putin may use this historic day to escalate his so-called \"special military operation\" in Ukraine and declare an outright war. Even if that had been Putin's plan, he was unlikely to follow through after Wallace's comments, not wanting to appear to his Western foes as such an easy nut to crack. Instead, the Russian president used his speech to blend history with the present, banking on Russian nationalism on its most patriotic of holidays to justify his war. In his reverence for Soviet war heroes who helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II -- the reason Russia celebrates Victory Day -- Putin referred to new Nazi threats in Ukraine, repeating his baseless justification for the invasion as an operation to \"denazify\" the nation. In reference to the threat of NATO troops in Europe, Putin said: \"Everything indicated that a clash with neo-Nazis, Banderites [Ukrainian nationalists], on whom the United States and their younger partners counted on, would be inevitable.\" \"Danger was increasing every day. Russia repelled this aggression in a preventative way. This was the only correct decision, and it was a timely decision. The decision of an independent, sovereign and powerful nation,\" he said. Putin had few other options than to use his speech to keep selling his war to his own people. He has so few successes in Ukraine to brag of, after all. All he can do now is to keep Russians on his side as they suffer the economic hardship of crippling sanctions and international isolationism. The question now is whether Putin will use this day -- or this week even -- to escalate the war in other ways. There are growing concerns that Russian forces will turn again to standoff weapons -- aerial strikes and long-range missiles, for example -- that can be fired from afar, as they so often do when they are on the backfoot. That's worrying, as those attacks are indiscriminate and tend to cause huge civilian tolls. A bombing of a school in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, that is feared to have killed at least 60 sheltering people over the weekend is just one example. After Russia's failure to take territory in Ukraine's north and around the capital, Kyiv, it's struggling even in the east and south, where it has had a presence through pro-Russian rebels for years. The possibility that Russia may win nothing, or very little, in Ukraine is real. Whether anything changes this Victory Day or not, a new chapter in the war will inevitably need writing soon.",

        "input": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologized for breaking his own Covid-19 restrictions, but claimed he didn't know the 2020 birthday gathering thrown in his honor was an illegal party, in his first comments to lawmakers since he was fined by police last week. Johnson offered members of Parliament what he called a \"whole-hearted apology\" on Tuesday, as he attempted to stem the rule-dodging scandal that has derailed his premiership. But he added it \"did not occur to me then or subsequently\" that the gathering \"could amount to a breach of the rules.\" He was addressing lawmakers for the first time since being fined by police on April 13 for attending a birthday party thrown for him in Downing Street in June 2020, when large indoor gatherings were banned. Officers are still investigating various other gatherings held in the heart of government during the Covid-19 crisis, and Johnson may receive more penalties in the coming weeks. The scandal, dubbed \"Partygate,\" has led to calls for Johnson to quit and sunk his party in opinion polls. Labour leader Keir Starmer called Johnson's Tuesday statement \"a joke.\" He added: \"The public have made up their mind; they don't believe a word the prime minister says. They know what he is.\" Hours before Johnson arrived at Parliament, the Speaker of the House dealt him another blow by allowing a vote on Thursday on whether he misled lawmakers in his initial denials of wrongdoing. Political commentators however note that Johnson is likely to survive Thursday's vote given his Conservative party's majority in Parliament. However, at least one senior Conservative MP -- Mark Harper -- joined calls for Johnson to resign. \"I regret to say that we have a Prime Minister who broke the laws that he told the country they had to follow, hasn't been straightforward about it,\" said Harper, the former whip. \"I'm very sorry to have to say this, but I no longer think he is worthy of the great office that he holds.\" Johnson claimed in December that he had been assured \"there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.\" It has since emerged he attended a number of events himself, including the birthday party for which he was penalized by police. But he insisted again on Tuesday that he did not knowingly mislead MPs, an offense which would contravene the country's ministerial code and would normally result in resignation. Johnson will expect to win Thursday's vote, given his parliamentary majority, though the ongoing scandal has tested the patience of a number of his backbenchers. An internal inquest, separate to the ongoing police investigation, has uncovered multiple parties, a culture of excessive drinking and a \"failure of leadership\" in Johnson's government while the rest of the country was living under strict rules on social mixing. Johnson is looking to stem the scandal before a round of local elections in early May, the first serious test of his Conservative Party since reports of the gatherings emerged.",

Authorities on Friday arrested 41-year-old Troy Driver of Fallon, Nevada, holding him on a kidnapping charge, according to the Lyon County Sheriff's office, which said Irion was still missing. It's unclear whether Driver has an attorney. Irion was last seen at about 5 a.m. March 12 in a Walmart parking lot in Fernley, Nevada, when she was abducted, according to the FBI. Surveillance video showed a man wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, dark pants or jeans and dark tennis shoes, approaching Irion's car at 5:24 a.m. About a minute later, her vehicle was seen leaving the parking lot with the man driving, Detective Erik Kusmerz with the Lyon County Sheriff's Office said. \"Naomi was last seen wearing a blue Panasonic company shirt, a gray cardigan sweater, gray pants, and brown boots. She was carrying a black purse. Naomi's iPhone (10 or 11) has yet to be found,\" the FBI said on its website. Irion's vehicle was found near the Walmart three days later. The FBI is asking anyone with information to contact their local FBI office or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.",

The British actor portrays Faraday, an extraterrestrial who comes to Earth as part of a plan to save both it and his home planet in the Showtime series, \"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\" He told CNN it was a role he couldn't resist. \"I thought that the character of Faraday was just such a great opportunity,\" he said. \"As an actor to go on such a crazy but beautiful kind of arc and journey with this character, really to find something remarkable.\" If the title and storyline sound familiar, it's because it's billed as an \"inspired continuation\" of the 1976 science fiction film starring David Bowie. But, this time, it's a series with Black actors, Ejiofor and Naomie Harris, portraying the main characters. Harris stars as Justin Falls, a brilliant scientist who Faraday enlists to help him on his mission. Jenny Lumet co-wrote and executive produced the series with Alex Kurtzman and said having actors of color was purposeful. \"The first character we understood was the character of Justin,\" Lumet said. \"I believe that you can make the argument that women of color are the most vulnerable populous on this planet. If I were coming and if I wanted a true and clear picture of this planet, those are the binoculars that I would need.\" Harris told CNN her character reminded her of her own mother and many of the other women who helped raise her, especially given the responsibility and tension involved in Justin linking up with Faraday, who literally has to learn how to communicate with her. \"I think that connection only comes about when we get over our fear of each other and when we are willing to listen and to communicate,\" she said. \"And that means listening to people whose perspectives we don't necessarily agree with as well, but we have to be willing to listen anyway.\" Co-writer Kurtzman noted that those are important lessons coming at a time when many are \"asking these enormous questions about how we got to this particular moment in our timeline as a species.\" \"And we could either deliver that to you in a very 'eat your vegetables' kind of way, or we could use science fiction as a genre and the prism of Fairday and Justin, both of whom really are the ultimate outsiders, as a way of looking at our planet and a way of looking at who we are now,\" Kurtzman said. \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" debuts on Showtime on April 24.",

He put us on his back,\" Heat guard Tyler Herro said after the game. Despite losing two of their starters -- Marcus Smart and Al Horford -- hours before the tip-off, the Celtics kicked off Game 1 strongly with a 7-0 run. In the first half, Boston led by as much as 13 and went into halftime 62-54 up with forward Jayson Tatum tying a career playoff-high in scoring for one half as he contributed 21 points. Then, the game turned on its head after halftime. A minute into the third quarter with the Heat trailing the Celtics by a point, Gabe Vincent's three-point attempt bounced off the rim. Butler grabbed the offensive rebound and converted a layup, putting Miami ahead for just the second time in the game. In the third quarter alone, Butler himself outscored the entire Celtics squad 17-14 as Boston conceded eight turnovers and shot 2-for-15 from the field -- its worst shooting percentage in any quarter over the last four seasons. \"I continued to play basketball the right way: shoot the ball when I'm open, attack, hit the open guy,\" Butler told reporters after the game. \"Honestly, it was a team effort.\" Although the Celtics rallied in the fourth quarter -- outscoring the Heat over the 12 minutes and hauling themselves back within nine points with 7:35 left -- the damage had already been done. \"They were down at halftime and came out and played hard in the third quarter,\" Tatum told reporters after the game. \"It's on me, I had six turnovers. I've got to take care of the ball better, especially in those situations when they're going on runs like that.\" Tatum had 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Celtics while Jaylen Brown had a double-double with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Vincent, filling in for six-time NBA All-Star Kyle Lowry at point guard, also starred for the Heat and contributed 17 points. It is the third time that the Celtics and the Heat have faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Miami winning both previous occasions. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Thursday in Miami.",

        "input": "(CNN)US home prices continued to surge higher in March, as buyers raced to lock in homes before the average mortgage rate hit 5%. Home prices rose 20.6% in March from the year before, an even higher rate than the 20% growth seen in February, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. It was the highest year-over-year price change in more than 35 years of data. Sun Belt cities again saw the biggest price increases among the 20 US cities tracked by the index. But for the first time in nearly three years, the city with the most rapid growth in housing prices was not Phoenix. Prices in Tampa, Florida, were up the most, rising 34.8% from the year before; Phoenix was up 32.4% from a year ago and Miami saw a 32% increase. Seventeen of the 20 cities reported higher price increases in the year ending March 2022 versus the year ending February 2022. Prices were strongest in the South and Southeast, but every region continued to show big gains. With mortgage rates rising and the Federal Reserve ratcheting up interest rates, the anticipated deceleration in the housing market did not arrive in March, said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \"The macroeconomic environment may not support extraordinary home price growth for much longer,\" said Lazzara. \"Although one can safely predict that price gains will begin to decelerate, the timing of the deceleration is a more difficult call.\" Another steep rise in home prices in March indicates that buyers felt pressure to bid competitively on the few homes available for sale, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"Home shoppers were motivated to lock in a mortgage rate before price increases, rising rates, or a combination of the two delivered a knockout punch to their aspirations,\" Hale said. A lot has happened since March, however. While mortgage rates surged nearly a whole percentage point in March, average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage did not reach 5% until April. Since then, rates have risen to as high as 5.3%, but have retreated over the past few weeks, according to Freddie Mac. In addition, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice -- including the largest rate hike since 2000 -- and the double whammy of inflation and the war in Ukraine has taken a greater toll on the economy. More recent housing data suggest the market has shifted since March. \"We've observed a real estate refresh that has more sellers listing homes, leading to greater availability of homes for sale compared to this time last year,\" said Hale. \"Meanwhile, mortgage rates have steadied, but remain near the highest levels in 13 years.\" But importantly, she said, recent sales data for both new homes and existing homes signal that buyers are increasingly unable or unwilling to buy a home under these conditions. \"As buyer confidence sags and weighs down demand, real estate markets will re-balance, eventually tilting away from the heavy advantage that recent home sellers have enjoyed,\" said Hale. \"This will initially mean fewer home sales, which should diminish the bidding wars and concessions that buyers make to sweeten offers.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)A January 6, 2021, rioter pleaded guilty Friday to carrying a loaded firearm on US Capitol grounds and assaulting police officers with one of their own batons during the insurrection. Mark Mazza, who told federal investigators he regretted not seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the riot and that they would \"be here for another reason\" if he had, faces a maximum of 20 years for assaulting officers with a dangerous weapon. According to the plea agreement, Mazza, 57, carried a revolver loaded with shotgun and hollow-point rounds in a holster under his shirt during the \"Stop the Steal\" rally and on Capitol grounds that day. Republican lawmakers and conservative allies have often falsely claimed that no weapons were brought to the Capitol to argue the attack was not the violent insurrection that it was. Mazza lost the weapon on Capitol grounds sometime before walking to the Lower West Terrace tunnel where rioters were battling police officers, according to the plea. Inside the tunnel, Mazza held open a door against police officers as \"other rioters used flag poles, batons, sticks, and stolen law enforcement shields as weapons to strike at, hit, and try to force their way through\" the police line, the plea agreement states. He then stole a police officer's baton and used it against the officers guarding the tunnel entrance. The plea agreement also states that after Mazza was pushed out of the tunnel by police officers, he \"took steps to assist\" Capitol Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was dragged out into the crowd and beaten. Mazza, the agreement says, \"was in close physical proximity to (Fanone) and took steps to assist the officer from being further assaulted by members of the riot.\" Mazza left Capitol grounds only after law enforcement deployed flash-bang grenades later that day, the agreement says. Mazza originally denied assaulting officers, even saying he assisted them out of the building, despite video footage of him swinging a baton in a battle with police. He drove home to Indiana after the riot with the stolen baton in his possession, according to prosecutors. Mazza was recorded in multiple videos saying, \"We own this house!\" Federal investigators found Mazza after he falsely reported the weapon he brought to the riot was stolen on January 8, 2021, claiming it was taken from his car at an Ohio casino. He later told investigators he fabricated the claim because he feared member of Antifa might find the gun and his name was \"all over it.\" This story has been updated with additional information Friday.",

        "input": "(CNN)President Joe Biden will travel to Alabama on Tuesday to visit a Lockheed Martin facility that manufactures Javelin anti-tank missiles, among other weapons being sent to Ukraine, the White House said Wednesday. Javelin missiles are among the most in-demand items for the Ukrainian military as it fights off the Russian invasion. In March, Ukraine told the US it needs 500 of the anti-tank missiles every day. \"The President will travel to Alabama to visit a Lockheed Martin facility which manufactures weapon systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, which the Biden-Harris Administration is providing Ukraine and which Ukrainians are using so effectively to defend against the Russian invasion,\" the statement released by the White House said. Last week, Biden alluded to the missiles as he announced a new military aide package that came in at roughly $800 million following a similarly sized measure earlier this month. If approved, the latest package would mean the US has committed approximately $3.4 billion dollars in assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began on February 24. Speaking about the importance of getting aid to Ukraine, Biden paraphrased a famous quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt, telling reporters: \"Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well.\" He was referring to an anti-tank missile the US has provided to the Ukrainian military. The package announced by Biden last week would be the last presidential drawdown until Congress approves more money for weapons to Ukraine. In a presidential drawdown, the Defense Department pulls weapons and equipment from US inventories to send to Ukraine instead of purchasing new weapons from manufacturers. Biden said in his remarks last week that he will make a formal request for Congress to approve a second supplemental funding package to aid Ukraine, adding that he expected Congress to \"move and act quickly\" on the package. \"In order to sustain Ukraine for the duration of this fight, next week I'm going to have to be sending to Congress a supplemental budget request to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters and continue to deliver economic assistance to the Ukrainian people,\" Biden said.

        "input": "(CNN)The widow of Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith has won a months-long fight to have her husband's death declared in the line of duty, following his suicide days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. According to a letter obtained exclusively by CNN, the District of Columbia's Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board has found that Smith \"sustained a personal injury on January 6, 2021, while performing his duties and that his injury was the sole and direct cause of his death.\" The ruling makes his family eligible to receive benefits. The board issued an order to Erin Smith on Wednesday night vacating the previous decision to deny her survivor's benefits, granting her an annuity equal to her late husband's pay. Erin Smith had petitioned the Retirement and Relief Board last year to declare her husband's suicide a line-of-duty death. Her attorney, David P. Weber, produced video evidence for the board that showed Jeffrey Smith being assaulted by the mob and hit in the head with a metal pole on January 6. He died nine days later, after he shot himself in the head while driving to work from his home in Virginia. It was supposed to be his first day back after seeking medical attention for the injuries and mental trauma he suffered on January 6. \"This was a forensic death investigation from the beginning,\" said Weber, who is also a forensic accounting professor at Salisbury University in Maryland. \"At the beginning, we didn't know what happened to Officer Smith. We took the evidence from the autopsy, expert witnesses, body camera footage and federal subpoenas to prove that Jeff suffered a traumatic brain injury on January 6.\" Weber told CNN last year that \"while the bullet may have been the actual cause of death, the chain of events was set in motion January 6 and the chain was not broken.\" Smith's family now has confirmation from the Retirement and Relief Board that his death was caused by the injuries he had sustained on January 6. The order will also entitle Smith's widow to health benefits, according to Weber. There is no known previous case, Weber said, in which the suicide of a Metropolitan Police officer has been declared a line-of-duty death. \"Officer Smith's widow is overwhelmed, because she knows this is going to help so many future families,\" Weber said. \"Erin Smith calls for her husband to now be entitled to the ceremony and honor to which a fallen hero and his family is entitled.\" This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.",

Rosenbaum, a 36-year veteran of the Justice Department, previously served as the director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy, and helped the department over 100 cases to strip citizenship from or deport accused Nazis, according to the Justice Department. The announcement is a signal from DOJ that it is interested in investigating war crimes in the ongoing war in Ukraine and follows a previous effort by the department to lock down the assets of Russian oligarchs. \"There is no hiding place for war criminals. The US Justice Department will pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\" Garland said in Ukraine. \"Working alongside our domestic and international partners, the Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable every person complicit in the commission of war crimes, torture, and other grave violations during the unprovoked conflict in Ukraine.\" Garland also said that the DOJ will send three prosecutors to advise Ukraine, as well as countries in Europe and the Middle East, in fighting Russian efforts to evade global sanctions.",

        "input": "(CNN)When she was found after a three-week search in 2016, a Northern California woman told police she had been abducted and branded by two women who kept her chained in a closet. She gave an elaborate story of her kidnapping and treatment at the hands of the supposed assailants, whom she said wore masks, spoke Spanish and held her at gunpoint. Now, Sherri Papini, 39, has been arrested and charged with making false statements to a federal law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a news release. Papini was arrested on Thursday. On Friday, Papini made her initial appearance before US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson, according to Lauren Horwood, a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of California. Papini was represented by attorney Michael Borges, Horwood said. CNN has reached out to Borges for comment, but has not heard back. Papini was ordered detained as a danger and flight risk until Tuesday, March 8, at 2 pm, for a detention hearing before Peterson to determine her custody status, Horwood said. Besides her detention hearing, Papini's next court date is March 18 at 2 pm. Late Thursday, Chris Thomas, a spokesperson for Papini, her husband Keith and her family, criticized police for her arrest, which he said occurred in front of her children. Sherri Papini would have gone to the police station, Thomas said. \"Sherri and Keith have cooperated with law enforcement's requests despite repeated attempts to unnecessarily pit them against each other, empty threats to publicly embarrass them and other conduct that was less than professional,\" Thomas said. \"We are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\" \"When a young mother went missing in broad daylight, a community was filled with fear and concern,\" said US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert in the DOJ's initial release. \"Countless hours were spent following leads, all in an effort to bring this woman back to her family. Three weeks later, she was found 146 miles south of where she disappeared, and the focus went from trying to find her to trying to find her abductors. \"Ultimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping and that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant's conduct.\" Husband reported her missing Keith Papini reported Sherri Papini missing on November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up their kids at day care. She was last seen jogging near her house in Shasta County. Three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, she was found alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. Based on her account, police searched for two Hispanic women matching Papini's description. But investigators ultimately found Papini had made it up, according to prosecutors. They say Papini was staying voluntarily with an ex-boyfriend during her alleged disappearance, and had caused her own injuries to support her lies. DNA evidence eventually led them to the ex-boyfriend, according to the press release and the criminal complaint prosecutors filed in US District Court. In August 2020, Papini was \"warned that it was a crime to lie to federal agents\" during an interview with federal and local investigators, said the press release. \"She was presented with evidence that showed she had not been abducted. Instead of retracting her kidnapping story, Papini continued to make false statements about her purported abductors,\" said the DOJ press release. Additionally, Papini received about 35 payments totaling more than $30,000 from the California Victim's Compensation Board, the release said. The money covered expenses, including visits to her therapist and an ambulance that took her to the hospital after she reemerged. Papini faces up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted of making false statements, and a maximum 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on the mail fraud charge.",

        "input": "(CNN Business)A coalition of thousands of Etsy sellers signaled support for a one-week strike starting on Monday   the same day the online marketplace known for its unique handicrafts will start hiking the fees it charges those who use its platform to earn a living. An online petition started by Etsy (ETSY) shop owner Kristi Cassidy urging the company to cancel the fee increases   which tick up from 5% to 6.5% starting Monday   has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures. Of those signatories, some 18,500 come from people who have identified as Etsy sellers who support the strike, according to Etsy shop operator and strike participant Mattie Boyd. \"We feel like we deserve a seat at the table,\" Boyd told CNN Business. \"And we hope these demands are met, that's our immediate goal. But, generally, there's got to be some kind of change, where there's some kind of dialogue, or Etsy sellers have some kind of representation where these decisions are being made.\" Sellers participating in the strike are putting their shops on \"vacation mode\" for a week starting Monday, according to Cassidy's petition, a temporary setting that lets users essentially put their Etsy shop on hold for a designated period of time. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman announced the fee increases in a memo to sellers in late February. The letter touted Etsy's massive growth over the past two years, boasting how active sellers last year increased their sales by \"23% on average compared to 2019, and in 2021 alone, we showed more than 90 million active buyers worldwide that there's an alternative to big-box, automated shopping.\" Silverman then announced plans to \"make significant investments in marketing, seller tools, and creating a world-class customer experience so we can continue this tremendous growth.\" \"To support this goal, on April 11 we will increase our current 5% transaction fee to 6.5%,\" Silverman wrote. Etsy is the main source of income for Boyd, who operates a shop via the online retailer featuring homemade graphic T-shirts and other \"niche\" items that Boyd says are \"geared towards people who are members of the queer and trans community, and who are also into punk rock and metal.\" Demands listed in the petition include canceling the fee increases passed onto sellers; creating a comprehensive plan to crack down on \"reseller\" shops (people selling mass-produced goods that they have not designed themselves); improve and expedite the support systems for sellers who have had their business disrupted by Etsy's automated tools; end the \"Star Seller\" program that Etsy uses to rate sellers; and to let sellers opt out of offsite ads for their products. Boyd said many sellers felt like they weren't given a fair way to give feedback on the sudden fee-hike announcement, which marks the first increase since 2018. While the other demands in the petition are issues Boyd said have been brewing for a while, \"I think for a lot of us it was that 30% increase [to fees] that really lit the match,\" Boyd added. \"The strike officially is meant to go from April 11, today, through April 18,\" Boyd told CNN Business. \"But people are being encouraged to participate for as much time as they feel like they can, and no one's being shamed if they can't do the whole week.\" With sellers spread out across the country, Boyd said organizers are using a slew of tech tools to rally together and support each other   including Reddit channels, Discord chats, and Instagram. Raina Moskowitz, the chief operating officer for Etsy, told CNN Business in a statement via email on Monday that \"sellers' success is a top priority for Etsy.\" \"We are always receptive to seller feedback and, in fact, the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition, including marketing, customer support, and removing listings that don't meet our policies,\" the statement added. \"We are committed to providing great value for our 5.3 million sellers so they are able to grow their businesses while keeping Etsy a beloved, trusted, and thriving marketplace.\" The seller strike on Etsy notably comes amid a wave of workplace activism seen at a slew of major companies over the past year -- from Starbucks (SBUX) to Amazon. Earlier this month, Amazon (AMZN) workers in Staten Island, New York, voted to form the e-commerce giant's first-ever US labor union in a landmark election. Amazon has since filed an appeal, calling for a do-over of the entire vote.",

        "input": "(CNN)CNN reported on Thursday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had given his side the go ahead to participate in bipartisan talks on gun legislation in the wake of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Which might surprise you -- especially because there hasn't been a meaningful gun control measure passed through the Senate in nearly 30 years. So, what's McConnell up to here? Remember first that McConnell doesn't do anything -- anything -- without being aware of the political consequences and complications. Criticize him for that if you will (and you probably will), but his willingness to always make a raw political calculation is what has made him so successful. McConnell knows that the slaughter of 19 kids (and two teachers) has galvanized the country in search of some sort of common-sense gun reform in a way not seen since mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. In the face of those calls for action, he doesn't want his party to be seen as totally unwilling to talk or to negotiate. While guns have not been a dominant voting issue in the past, McConnell knows that this election -- if past is prologue -- should be a very good one for Republicans, and doesn't want to do (or not do) anything to change that dynamic. But a very public willingness to engage in bipartisan talks about guns is not at all the same thing as backing a major piece of gun control legislation. All you need to do is look at the words McConnell used in his statement sanctioning the talks. \"I met with Sen. Cornyn this morning,\" he told CNN Thursday. \"As you know he went home yesterday to see the family members and begin the fact finding of this awful massacre and I have encouraged him to talk with Sen. Murphy and Sen. Sinema and others who are interested in trying to get an outcome that is directly related to the problem. I am hopeful that we could come up with a bipartisan solution.\" The key piece of that quote is this: \"I have encouraged him to talk with Sen. Murphy and Sen. Sinema and others who are interested in trying to get an outcome that is directly related to the problem.\" \"Directly related.\" What McConnell is signaling there is that he might be willing to support a narrowly cast piece of legislation that deals directly with the circumstances around how the Uvalde shooter got his guns and ammunition. McConnell didn't offer any specifics on what that might look like. The shooter bought the weapons he used legally and had not had any reported issues with mental illness before. McConnell's view then may not be far from what Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said earlier this week: \"If you want to stop violent crime, the proposals the Democrats have -- none of them would have stopped this.\" Don't get it twisted: McConnell's sanctioning of bipartisan talks on guns should NOT be read as some sort of major change in the broader Republican view on gun control. The party remains broadly opposed to any sort of sweeping (or semi-sweeping) legislation that would fundamentally alter our relationship with guns in this country.",

        "input": "(CNN)Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett received six-figure book advances last year for upcoming book projects, financial disclosure forms made public Thursday revealed. The disclosure filings of Barrett -- the court's newest member -- shows she received a $425,000 advance from the literary agent Javelin Group, which has represented some of Washington's most prominent figures, like former FBI Director James Comey and former House Speaker John Boehner, in book negotiations. Gorsuch -- who authored a broad-audience book called \"A Republic, If You Can Keep It' in 2019 -- received $250,000 from the publishing company HarperCollins last year, according to his form. The income is listed as \"book royalties,\" but Politico reported Thursday that the amount was an advance for a new book judicial and regulatory policy. Javelin, which is also reportedly representing Gorsuch, did not respond to CNN's inquiry about his and Barrett's disclosures. Neither HarperCollins nor Sentinel, the imprint that is reportedly putting out the Barrett project, responded to CNN's inquiry. The Supreme Court's public information office also did not reply. Other members of the court authored books recently for which they received income last year, according to their disclosures. Justice Sonia Sotomayor received more than $115,000 in book royalties from Penguin Random House, which has published several children's books by the justice. Justice Stephen Breyer received $7,814.21 in royalty income last year from the publishing house, which published his 2021 book about the importance of an independent court.",

        "input": "(CNN)In their book, \"This Will Not Pass,\" New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns write of a dinner between Republican Sens. John Thune, Susan Collins and Rob Portman and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in early 2021. Collins had arranged the dinner following Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with a local West Virginia TV station in which she said that the country was facing a \"crisis of unbelievable proportions\" and that politicians needed to \"step up and stand for them.\" While she didn't mention West Virginia's Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, by name, it was very clear whom Harris was targeting with her words. And Manchin was upset. Sensing an opportunity, Collins, who had a close relationship with Manchin, invited him to dinner with her, Portman and Thune, the second-highest ranking Republican in the Senate. Manchin had rejected party-switching appeals in the past, so Thune pitched him on becoming an independent and caucusing with the Republicans, according to reporting from Burns and Martin. Here's the key passage from the book: \"Thune suggested Manchin would likely be rewarded for taking such a step: You could write your own ticket, the South Dakotan told him. Chair a committee, we'll help you raise money for your campaign. \"Manchin heard them out and gave Thune a politically deft response. \"John, he said, if you were the leader I would do it.\" Which, well, interesting, right? Yes! Absolutely! On Thursday, CNN Capitol Hill producer Morgan Rimmer asked Manchin about the comments. \"Not that I can remem -- no, we talk all the time, we have dinners together and all that. No, they're always kidding back and forth,\" Manchin said. Which isn't exactly a denial. Then Manchin added this: \"John Thune is the most decent human being, a good friend of mine. But no, they know where I'm at. And Mitch McConnell knows he's tried everything humanly possible. The bottom line is I am a West Virginia Democrat.\" Which, again, is not a denial that he told Thune that if the South Dakotan was the Republican leader, he would switch parties! For his part, Thune told reporters Thursday that Manchin's remark was made in \"good humor\" and that the West Virginia Democrat has \"never given any serious consideration\" to switching parties. Now, there is no way that McConnell is not the Senate Republican leader come 2023. But who's to say what the future holds? And Thune could be positioned to ascend to the top job whenever the Kentucky Republican steps aside. If Manchin is still in the Senate at that point, does his party-switching calculus change? For Democrat activists already leery of Manchin -- and for Democratic strategists perennially worried about him leaving the party -- his comments are something well short of reassuring that he's always going to be with them. This story has been updated with new comments from Thune.",

        "input": "(CNN)South Korea's latest Covid-19 wave has pushed the country's total infections past 10 million since the pandemic began, as funeral homes struggle to keep up with a sudden surge in deaths. Cases began rising in February, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The country is now seeing hundreds of thousands of new cases each day -- some of the highest daily averages in the world. Authorities reported 395,598 new cases on Thursday, pushing the total caseload to 10.8 million, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. That makes up about 20% of the national population -- meaning roughly one out of every five South Koreans have now been infected at some stage of the pandemic. And Wednesday saw the country's deadliest day so far, with 470 new Covid deaths -- the highest daily coronavirus death toll since the virus was first detected in South Korea, according to data released Thursday. But with almost 87% of South Korea's 52 million residents fully vaccinated and 63% of residents having now received booster shots, the country's infection and death rate is still far lower than many other nations. The recent spike in deaths has seen a demand for funeral arrangements rise. The health ministry on Monday instructed crematories nationwide to operate for longer hours. It also ordered 1,136 funeral parlors capable of storing some 8,700 bodies to expand their facilities. \"Crematories' capacity is increasing,\" ministry official Son Young-rae said. \"But there are still regional differences.\" Authorities have already boosted the combined daily cremation capacity from about 1,000 to 1,400 per day starting last week. But a large backlog of bodies continued to be reported in the densely populated greater Seoul area, Son said. Health ministry data showed that the 28 crematories in Seoul city were operating at 114.2% capacity as of Monday, while the ratio stood at about 83% in other regions such as Sejong and Jeju. The number of critically ill patients has been hovering above 1,000 for the past two weeks, but it could go up to 2,000 in early April, said Park Hyang, another health ministry official. Despite the surge, South Korea is easing its Covid-19 restrictions, and public opinion appears to support those moves. On Monday, the cap on private gatherings was upped from six to eight people; other relaxations include scrapping the seven-day quarantine for fully vaccinated international arrivals, except for those coming from \"high-risk countries\" including Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Myanmar. The government has also stopped enforcing vaccine passes and scaled back its once-aggressive system of contact tracing and quarantine. \"We see this could be the last major crisis in our Covid responses, and if we overcome this crisis, it would bring us nearer to normal lives,\" Son, the health official, said in a briefing last week.",

        "input": "Washington (CNN Business)Key parts of a Florida law restricting social media platforms' ability to moderate content likely violate the First Amendment, a federal appeals court ruled Monday, in a victory for the tech industry amid a wider battle over digital speech. The opinion by a three-judge panel in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals comes ahead of a hotly anticipated Supreme Court decision involving a similar Texas law. Both cases are viewed as a bellwether for social media and could determine the future not only of the tech industry, but all Americans' First Amendment rights. In a statement, one of the technology advocacy groups behind both lawsuits, the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the ruling was welcome news. \"When a digital service takes action against problematic content on its own site 一 whether extremism, Russian propaganda, or racism and abuse 一 it is exercising its own right to free expression,\" said CCIA President Matt Schruers. \"We will continue to fight for the First Amendment rights of digital services to engage in the editorial judgments they need to make to protect their users.\" Monday's decision upholds portions of a temporary injunction that had blocked the Florida law, SB 7072, from going into effect last year. The Florida law seeks to allow political candidates to sue social media platforms over allegations of censorship, and imposes a number of requirements on tech platforms' content moderation activities. According to the panel's opinion, the court held that \"the Act's content-moderation restrictions are substantially likely to violate the First Amendment,\" and that social media platforms are considered private actors that benefit from First Amendment protections against compelled speech. The court held as unconstitutional the Florida law's provisions with regard to social media companies' handling of posts by and about political candidates, as well as on the banning of candidates, and its requirements that tech platforms explain each content moderation decision. The court held that other provisions of the law were more reasonable and overturned the injunction against those provisions before sending the matter back to the lower court. \"We are pleased the court recognized the state's authority to rein in social media companies and upheld major portions of Florida's law leading the way in doing so,\" Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a tweet. \"We will continue to vigorously defend Florida's authority to demand accountability from Big Tech.\" The Supreme Court is poised to address similar questions about platform liability in an upcoming decision about whether to let Texas's law remain in effect. Texas's law enables any user in the state to sue social media platforms if they believe they've been silenced or censored. Texas and Florida have argued that the First Amendment has nothing to do social media platforms because their laws designate the companies as \"common carriers\" akin to phone companies and railroads. In Monday's decision, the Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument. \"We hold that it is substantially likely that social-media companies even the biggest ones are 'private actors' whose rights the First Amendment protects,\" the court said. It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will agree.",

        "input": "(CNN)A new law in New York State gives sexual assault survivors a one-year window to bring claims against abusers, setting aside the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits. Advocates praised the Adult Survivors Act (ASA), which was signed into law Tuesday by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat. It mirrors the 2019 Child Victims Act that expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more time to sue their abusers. The law applies to survivors of sexual offenses that occurred when they were over the age of 18, with the one-year window beginning six months from the bill signing and allowing claims regardless of the statute of limitations. \"To those who thought they got away with horrific crimes they committed, I just have one message: Your time is up. Your victims will see you in court and you will be brought to justice,\" Hochul told reporters Tuesday. Lawmakers and advocates said that, like the child victim's legislation, the new law is intended to help survivors who have kept sexual abuse secret for years beyond the statute of limitations out of shame and fear. \"It's not possible to show up fully in the world when you are hiding your truth to make space for your abuser's lie, so this is a watershed moment,\" Drew Dixon, a sexual abuse survivor and advocate, said in a statement, referring to the new law. \"The ASA will empower survivors to have their stories heard, scrutinized, and at long last, acknowledged.\" In 2019, the state extended the statute of limitations for adults filing civil claims for certain sex crimes to 20 years but the legislation only applied to new cases. \"For many survivors it takes years to come to terms with the abuses committed against them, let alone to summon the courage to come forward to report the abuse, to confront a boss or a trusted co-worker or family member in a protracted court fight,\" said New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat and sponsor of the bill. The Child Victims Act's lookback window was later expanded to two years due to the pandemic -- allowing victims of child sexual abuse to file a civil lawsuit against a person or institution, no matter how much time had passed since the abuse. The law also expanded the statute of limitations for potential child sexual abuse cases going forward. Previously, child sex abuse cases in New York could not be prosecuted more than five years after the crime occurred, and civil lawsuits had to be brought within three years after the victim's 18th birthday. The lookback window opened in August 2019 and closed in August 2021. More than 10,600 child sexual abuse lawsuits were filed in New York during that period, New York Courts spokesman Lucian Chalfen said in January.",

        "input": "(CNN)New details have emerged revealing how convicted murderer Gonzalo Lopez escaped a prisoner bus in Texas and what he did before killing a family of five, police say. Lopez's escape last month triggered one of the largest inmate search efforts in state history as hundreds of officers scoured the wooded area where he was believed to have been hiding. Authorities say the fugitive killed a family in their Leon County home last week, and he later died in a shootout with police. Just days before he killed 66-year-old Mark Collins and his four grandsons, Lopez broke into a neighboring property, according to spokesman Robert Hurst of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Collins and his grandchildren had been visiting the family's weekend ranch outside Centerville, Texas, located near where the inmate had escaped three weeks prior and within the perimeter police were searching following the escape, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Lopez broke into the neighboring home of the sprawling Collins ranch property \"24-48 hours in advance\" of his attack on the family, Hurst said. No one was home at the neighboring house at the time. Law enforcement officials did not appear to alert residents that there were signs of suspicious activity at the home next to the ranch , according to CNN conversations with local residents.  In response to questions about why locals were not alerted as soon as law enforcement suspected a break-in had taken place, a Texas prison spokesman said DNA testing was needed to confirm it was Lopez who broke into the home. Mark Collins and his four grandchildren were shot and stabbed to death, according to Crime Stoppers of Houston director of victim services and advocacy Andy Kahan, who says he met with the Collins family in the days after the killings. After killing the family, Lopez stole their truck and was quickly named by authorities as the prime suspect in the killings. On June 2, the fugitive was killed in a shootout with police officers in the town of Jourdanton, hundreds of miles from the Collins' home, DCJ said. Officers were able to disable the truck with a spike strip, causing Lopez to crash. He then engaged in a firefight with officers, DCJ said. \"He fired several rounds at officers and was armed with an AR-15 and a pistol,\" Jason Clark with the DCJ said, adding they believe the firearms were likely stolen from the home in Centerville where the family was killed. No officers were injured. The grandchildren killed by Lopez were identified as brothers Waylon, 18, Carson, 16, and Hudson, 11, and their cousin, Bryson Collins, 11. The family's pastor, Steve Bezner, called Collins and his grandsons an \"amazing family\" that was \"close-knit and of deep faith.\" Other prisoners created a distraction, state says The prisoner escaped on May 12 as he was being transported to a medical appointment in Huntsville, Texas, according to authorities. Lopez, 46, who was serving two life sentences for capital murder, attempted capital murder and aggravated kidnapping convictions, was in a \"separate, caged area of the bus, designated for high-risk inmates,\" according to a statement from Texas DCJ. As the bus approached Centerville, the 15 other inmates on the bus started causing noise and distraction, allowing Lopez to carry out his escape, Hurst told CNN. Inside the caged area, Lopez used a \"prison-made knife and key\" to break free from his handcuffs and to cut through the cage to reach the prison correctional officer who was driving the bus, according to Texas State Sen. John Whitmire, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice and routinely receives briefings from state law enforcement. DCJ authorities have previously said that the prisoner cut through the bottom of the cage before stabbing the driver with \"some sort of object\" and unsuccessfully attempting to grab the officer's service weapon. Lopez and the driver got out of the bus, and a second officer at the back of the vehicle got out and began approaching the prisoner, DCJ said. Lopez got back in the bus and drove a short distance, authorities said. The officers shot out the back tires, causing Lopez to crash a short distance down the road, according to authorities. The inmate then ran off into the woods along Highway 7 in Leon County. For three weeks, Lopez avoided police as a massive manhunt for him was underway. For the first two weeks of the search, prison officials held multiple briefings on search efforts that included about 400 officers on the ground, searching the wooded area where Lopez was believed to be hiding. \"We had no clue where he was,\" Hurst told CNN. \"How he managed to give everybody the slip was incredibly frustrating.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)Four states moved to curtail abortion access this week, with two of them advancing their own versions of a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy -- similar to the controversial Mississippi law before the US Supreme Court that's set up a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. Here's what you need to know. Kentucky abortion providers suing to block restrictive new law The only two clinics in Kentucky in which abortions are performed, Planned Parenthood and EMW Women's Surgical Center, are separately suing to block a new state abortion law, saying it amounts to a de facto ban on abortions in Kentucky. The law bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, restricts access to medication abortion and enforces more requirements for minors to obtain abortions in the state. The plaintiffs argue they can't comply with the new law, claiming Kentucky hasn't yet set up a system to meet its reporting requirements. \"It is arbitrary and unconstitutional to enforce penalties for noncompliance while failing to provide a means of immediate compliance. Plaintiff, in fairness, must be granted time to comply with these sweeping changes to the provision of abortion care,\" said the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Kentucky, on behalf of the EMW Women's Surgical Center, in its lawsuit, adding that patients will now be unable to obtain abortions in Kentucky or forced to seek them out of the state, unless the court intervenes. The measure went into effect this week after Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's veto of the bill. The governor had said the bill was \"likely unconstitutional,\" noting its lack of exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest and arguing it would cost the state an estimated near $1 million to enforce. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, said in a statement: \"We are prepared to earnestly defend this new law against the legal challenge from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU.\" Florida governor signs 15-week abortion ban into law Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure into law on Thursday that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The bill allows exemptions in cases where pregnancy poses \"serious\" health risks or fatal fetal abnormalities are detected if two physicians confirm the diagnoses in writing. It goes into effect on July 1. Oklahoma governor signs near-total ban Oklahoma GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill into law that makes performing an abortion illegal in the state, with an exception only in the case of a medical emergency. The law will take effect this summer, barring any legal challenge. Senate Bill 612, which cleared the state Senate last year and the House earlier this month, makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. Tennessee House passes bill that would restrict medication abortion The Tennessee Republican-led House passed a bill on Thursday that would allow only physicians to provide drugs used in medication abortions and bar the drugs from being sent via mail. The legislation, House Bill 2416, would establish criminal penalties and civil liability for offenders that would not apply to the patient who was provided the abortion drugs. It would also require physicians to examine patients in person before providing the abortion drugs and to schedule follow-up visits for the patients. The bill passed the House by 68-20 on Thursday. It now heads to the state Senate, where Republican lawmakers also have a majority.",

Security personnel deployed barriers to stop the intruders' vehicle, which arrived around 9 p.m. ET and failed to follow commands at the base's Main Gate, the release said. No shots were fired. Harris had arrived on the base at 8:47 p.m. ET via Air Force Two, according to pool reports, after a trip to Selma, Alabama, to mark the 57th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. The motive behind the incident was not immediately clear. In an update Monday morning, base officials said a full sweep of the area was conducted and evidence was found indicating the second intruder \"departed the installation.\" Both the vice president and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were in Marine Two around 8:51 p.m. ET, according to a pool report, and had left the base per a pool report around 9 p.m. ET. Harris' office told the pool that her staff and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, who were all traveling with Harris, were safely off the base, according to a pool report at nearly 10 p.m. President Joe Biden traveled directly back to the White House via Marine One after spending the weekend in Wilmington, Delaware. The TV pool that was traveling with Biden landed separately at Joint Base Andrews and saw people searching a wooded area with flashlights and several police cars traveling at high speed. The pool traveling with Biden was safely off the base as of nearly 10 p.m. ET. The pool that traveled with Harris was also off the base as of 11:55 p.m. ET. CNN has reached out to the US Secret Service for comment.",

A military judge on Tuesday sentenced Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley to give up $10,910 of his pay and allowances each month for five months, totaling more than $50,000 in fines. Based on his conviction, Cooley had faced a maximum punishment of dismissal from the Air Force, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for seven years, an Air Force release said. Cooley's court-martial marked the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the 75-year history of the military branch, the Air Force said in a statement. Cooley had pleaded not guilty. He was found guilty of forcibly kissing an unnamed civilian woman in a car after an evening barbecue in New Mexico in 2018, a release from the Air Force said. The general was convicted of one of three specifications of sexual assault: kissing the victim \"on the lips and tongue, with an intent to gratify his sexual desire,\" an Air Force release said. The judge found Cooley not guilty of the two other specifications. In court testimony, the victim alleged Cooley had pressed her against a car window and forcibly kissed her and groped her through her clothes after she had driven him home from the social event at his request. The Air Force does not name sexual assault victims, but the woman has allowed news organizations to disclose her relationship to Cooley without naming her. The victim's attorney, Ryan Guilds, praised the court-martial process as \"fair\" and commended his client's bravery through the trial. \"It is very hard to be a survivor in a criminal case,\" Guilds said in a statement. \"That is one of the many reasons you see so few of these cases go to court-martial.\" Lt. Col. Matthew Neil, lead trial counsel for the government, said in a media availability after Cooley's sentencing that he believes this conviction and sentencing show that the Air Force \"takes seriously allegations of sexual assault or sexual offenses that are committed.\" \"This was a historic court-martial. The first general officer that was court-martialed at a general court-martial in the Air Force's 75-year history,\" Neil said. \"The Air Force takes seriously allegations of sexual assault or sexual offenses that are committed, those are investigated, and, when appropriate, offenders are held accountable without fear or favor regarding someone's status.\" Daniel Conway, Cooley's defense attorney, said there is a \"sense of closure\" after the sentencing and that his client wants to repair relationships both within his family and with the Air Force. \"I think there is a sense of closure. There is some sense of relief, and there is some desire to again repair all of those relationships. He still is an extremely talented individual with a lot to contribute both to this family and to our nation,\" Conway said at the media availability. Cooley has served in the US Air Force for three decades and \"has an otherwise unblemished career,\" Conway said. The general hopes to continue serving and to retire from the service, \"but those questions about retirement are to come,\" Conway said. Based on his sentencing, Cooley will remain in the Air Force for now, but based upon his conviction, he is subject to administrative discharge, a US Air Force spokesperson said. The spokesperson could not say when a determination about a possible discharge would be made. Cooley also has the right to retire from the US Air Force, the spokesperson added.",

Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, is now likely to testify in person during one of the committee's upcoming hearings after she replaced her lawyer who had significant links to the former President, according to a source familiar with the matter The committee has previously said it considers Hutchinson a key witness in its ongoing investigation, and she has testified several times behind closed doors. Hutchinson told the January 6 committee that Trump had suggested to Meadows he approved of the \"hang Mike Pence\" chants from rioters who stormed the US Capitol, CNN has reported. She also testified that Trump complained about his then-vice president being hustled to safety while Trump supporters breached the Capitol, the sources told CNN. Hutchinson has answered the panel's questions during three separate sessions and went over \"new ground\" with the committee last month, though it was not immediately clear what was discussed during that deposition. Hutchinson was not willing to risk taking a contempt of Congress charge to impede the probe and the change in representation is a sign she is more willing to cooperate with the committee, the source familiar with the matter told CNN. Her former boss, Meadows, was referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal contempt charges, but the DOJ ultimately decided not to pursue such a case. Hutchinson was initially represented by Stefan Passantino, an attorney with significant links to people in Trump's orbit. She fired Passantino, the source said, and is now represented by Jody Hunt of Alston Bird.",

Alonso told reporters Monday he was driving his pickup to Mets camp in Port St. Lucie when he was hit by another driver who ran a red light. Alonso, who set the major league home run record for rookies in 2019, said he was uninjured after his Ford pickup truck flipped over \"probably three times.\" \"This is a really special spring training because yesterday was a really close experience to death,\" Alonso said. \"I'm just really thankful to be alive. \"I was coming here to work, coming to spring training, and the next thing I know I'm kicking my windshield in trying to get out of a flipped-over car,\" he said. Alonso said his wife, Haley, was following him in another vehicle when the crash happened. On Monday, Haley posted several videos and photos on her Instagram account of Alonso's mangled truck at the reported crash site. The Tampa Police Department told CNN the crash happened just before 6:30 p.m. and confirmed that another driver hit Alonso's truck after running a red light. There were only minor injuries reported and the other driver was issued a citation, Public Information Officer Jamel Lanee' said. \"Just really blessed to be here. Thankful nothing is wrong,\" Pete Alonso said. \"Also thank you, Ford, for having great engineering.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was accused Monday of comparing climate activists to Nazis, in allegations that his spokesperson said were \"completely absurd.\" Scholz was speaking at a Catholic Day panel event in the city of Stuttgart on Friday when protesters disrupted him, with one activist reportedly trying to get up on stage before being blocked by security staff. \"I'll be honest: These black-clad displays at various events by the same people over and over again remind me of a time that is, thank God, long gone by,\" he said in an exchange captured on camera. His remarks went viral on Monday on social media, where a number of users expressed anger over his comments. Scholz was speaking about the phase-out of coal-fired power generation and resulting jobs losses in open cast mining when he was interrupted. Many Germans have taken the leader's words as a reference to the Nazis' SS black-uniformed corps. \"I have also been to events where five people sat dressed in the same way, each had a well-rehearsed stance, and then they do it again every time,\" he said. \"And that's why I think that is not a discussion, that is not participation in a discussion, but an attempt to manipulate events for one's own purposes. One should not do this.\" Scholz's comments sparked furor, with climate activist Luisa Neubauer commenting that the chancellor \"compares climate activists to Nazis.\" \"Where does one begin? In just one half-sentence, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic relativizes the Nazi regime and, in a paradoxical way, also the climate crisis,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"He stylizes climate protection as an ideology with parallels to the Nazi regime. In 2022. Jesus. This is such a scandal.\" CNN has reached out to the German government for comment. A government spokesperson earlier denied Scholz was making the comparison, calling the accusation \"completely absurd.\" \"These statements by the Chancellor speak for themselves and I would not want to comment on them here. But I can say that such a comparison is, of course, completely absurd,\" federal government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said. \"The Chancellor has made climate protection a priority of this legislative period of his chancellorship and he is, of course, always ready to deal with this topic and to discuss it,\" she added. A journalist at the conference further pressed Hoffman on Scholz's comments, noting: \"'Dark times' in Germany usually refers to the Nazi-era. You're saying that is not what Scholz meant?\" Hoffmann replied: \"I didn't say what was meant or not meant, I just said that I'm not commenting on it and that the statements stand for themselves.\" Prominent German Climate scientist Friederike Otto commented that \"Scholz 'forgets' our worst history, dismisses every generation that comes after him as irrelevant & the audience just applauds.\" Scholz's appointment as German chancellor came just months after Germany suffered its worst climate disaster of recent years, after devastating summer floods killed nearly 200 people there and dozens more across the border in Belgium. The chancellor leads a three-party coalition with partners the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, and their pledge to improve climate change action was central to their campaign. The new government plans to phase-out of coal by 2030 -- eight years earlier than Merkel's party's previous 2038 target, and in March, the government brought forward its deadline for a full transition to renewables in its power sector by at least five years, to 2035.",

Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta, said he was attacked on Thursday during a train ride from Moscow to the city of Samara, when an unidentified individual poured red paint all over him and his belongings. Muratov, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless defense of freedom of speech in Russia, told CNN earlier this week that half the country's population was against the war in Ukraine. In a post on Telegram on Thursday, Muratov said: \"They poured oil paint with acetone in the compartment. My eyes burned terribly. Moscow-Samara train. Oily smell all over the car. Departure has already been delayed by 30 minutes. I'll try to wash off. (The attacker) shouted: 'Muratov, here's to you for our boys.'\" A spokeswoman for the newspaper, which last month announced that it was suspending publication until the end of the war in Ukraine, told CNN that Muratov's eyes \"seem to be ok.\" Earlier this week, Muratov told CNN's \"Amanpour\" show that his team were \"forced\" to stop operating due to \"military censorship.\" During the interview, Muratov said it was \"impossible to look at\" photos from scenes from Mariupol, Melitopol, Bucha and other Ukrainian communities, adding that: \"This will become a huge case study of what dictatorship means.\" For the past 20 years, Russian people have been subjected to \"total propaganda,\" he said, the effect of which was \"the same as radiation.\" \"This propaganda has won a victory but not over everyone,\" he added. Muratov said by the Kremlin's own estimation some 25 million Russians are against the \"special operation\" in Ukraine, but that his organization estimates that figure to be as high as half the population. As of July 2021, Russia's population was estimated at around 142 million. \"Those who refuse to be zombies, that half of the country is for peace and against war,\" he told CNN. Last month, Muratov revealed plans to auction off his Nobel Peace Prize medal to support Ukrainian refugees. In a statement published on the newspaper's website, Muratov said the droves of \"wounded and sick children\" requiring \"urgent treatment\" compelled him to offer up the prestigious medal.",

Cooper, 101, attended Storer College in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, from 1934 to 1938, but dropped out during his senior year when his family relocated to Philadelphia for financial reasons, Jefferson County Schools said in a statement. Storer College was established in 1865 to serve newly freed slaves in the wake of the Civil War, according to the US National Park Service. The school was one of the only educational resources for Black residents of West Virginia. It served more than 7,000 students before closing in the mid-1950s. At the college, Cooper studied Latin, biology, history, English, and mathematics. In 2018, after a long and accomplished career in the transportation industry, Cooper visited the school, which is now part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. There, he expressed to family members his regret over not earning a diploma. To help him realize his dream, his family reached out to park staff, who worked with local, regional and state partners to honor the centenarian with a ceremony and diploma on March 19. Jefferson County Schools, the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, the Storer College National Alumni Association, and the West Virginia Department of Education were all involved. \"Jefferson County Schools is committed to helping every student, young or old, fulfill their dreams,\" Bondy Shay Gibson-Learn, the school system's superintendent, said in the JCS statement. \"For Mr. Cooper, that meant receiving a high school diploma. We are honored to help make that dream a reality.\"",

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Chapek apologized for his \"silence\" on Florida's controversial bill dubbed \"Don't Say Gay,\" days after declining to condemn it. On Monday, Chapek had spoken out about   but did not directly condemn   the controversial \"Parental Rights in Education\" bill,  which would ban educators from discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms. Disney employs 75,000 people in Florida. \"Thank you to all who have reached out to me sharing your pain, frustration and sadness over the company's response to the Florida 'Don't Say Gay' bill,\" Chapek wrote in a letter to employees Friday that was obtained by CNN. \"Speaking to you, reading your messages, and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was.\" He added that this issue is not just about \"a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights...You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.\" Disney will also be \"pausing all political donations in the state of Florida\" to reassess. The backlash began Monday when Chapek declined to issue a public statement about the bill, noting that corporate statements are \"often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame.\" Instead, he said at the time, \"one of the ways Disney can make lasting change is through its content, citing films like 'Encanto' and TV shows like 'Modern Family.' These and all of our diverse stories are our corporate statements   and they are more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort.\" The pushback was immediate, and by Wednesday, Chapek spoke against the bill on the company's annual shareholder meeting and said that his original statement didn't \"quite get the job done.\"He also said he spoke Wednesday with Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, about the bill. \"The governor heard our concerns and agreed to meet with me and LGBTQ+ members of our senior team in Florida to discuss ways to address them,\" he added. And on Friday, the apology letter. In it, Chapek told employees that starting immediately, Disney is \"increasing our support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states\" and that the company is \"hard at work creating a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values.\" Chapek also told employees that there's much more work to be done and that the company will share updates on that progress in the coming weeks. \"I truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our LGBTQ+ community,\" Chapek said. \"I missed the mark in this case but am an ally you can count on and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility, and opportunity you deserve.\"",

        "input": "(CNN Business)Facebook-parent Meta on Monday said it would soon offer more transparency and information to researchers about how political and social ads are targeted to users on the platform, months before the US midterm elections. Starting later this month, Meta (FB) will provide \"detailed targeting information for social issue, electoral or political ads\" to \"vetted academic researchers\" who have registered to be a part of the company's research-sharing initiative, according to Jeff King, the company's vice president of business integrity The effort, dubbed the Facebook Open Research and Transparency project, was created to help qualified academic researchers study social media's impact on society with measures included to protect users' privacy, according to the company. Facebook has previously faced criticism from inside and outside the company about how highly-targeted political ads risk undermining political discourse. The data provided to researchers will include information such as the interest categories, which can include everything from \"environmentalism\" to \"frequent travelers,\" chosen to help target each individual ad. King said that, starting in July, Meta's publicly-available Ad Library will also include a summary of targeting information for political ads, including location, demographics and interests. For example, the Ad Library could show that over the last 30 days, a page ran 2,000 ads about social issues, elections or politics, and that 40% of its spend on these ads was targeted to \"people who live in Pennsylvania\" or \"people who are interested in politics.\" \"By making advertiser targeting criteria available for analysis and reporting on ads run about social issues, elections and politics, we hope to help people better understand the practices used to reach potential voters on our technologies,\" King wrote. Last year, some researchers at New York University accused Facebook of deplatforming their accounts after they attempted to study the political ads users see on the social network. The company previously said it took action because NYU's Ad Observatory project studied political ads using \"unauthorized means to access and collect data,\" violating Facebook's terms of service.",

        "input": "(CNN)The temporary head of the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence division, John Cohen, is stepping down this month as President Joe Biden's appointee awaits confirmation, according to an internal memo sent to the workforce and obtained by CNN. Cohen assumed the role last July after a series of controversies embroiled the office during the Trump administration, including coming under scrutiny for not producing a bulletin or warning about the potential for violence at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.  Under Cohen's leadership, the intelligence office has been trying to revamp its stature, putting more emphasis on analyzing online threats of violence and working to revive its state and local partner relationships. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis also created an intelligence gathering unit to monitor the movement of migrants journeying to the US southern border and help inform law enforcement activities. \"I am writing to inform you that I will be leaving the Department effective April 8, 2022 in part so I can better attend to long-standing medical issues involving a member of my family,\" Cohen said in his memo. \"Returning to the federal government on January 20, 2021 was a great honor. It has been among the greatest privileges of my career to work with all of you.\" Melissa Smislova, a career official, will helm the agency on a temporary basis, which she has previously done, according to a source familiar with the situation. In a memo to the Intelligence and Analysis workforce, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas commended Cohen for being \"one of our nation's foremost national security experts.\" Cohen is expected to start a new private center focused on combating disinformation by foreign intelligence services, terrorist groups, and criminal organizations, the source said. Late last year, Biden nominated attorney and former Bush administration appointee Kenneth Wainstein to lead the DHS intelligence division. Wainstein served in federal government for years, including as a former assistant attorney general and chief of staff to former FBI Director Robert Mueller. If confirmed, Wainstein will become the top intelligence official at DHS, taking the helm as Under Secretary of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. During the final year of the Trump administration, the Intelligence and Analysis Office became entangled in a series of public controversies, starting with a revelation that the office compiled \"intelligence reports\" about the work of two US journalists covering protests in Portland, Oregon, in 2020. An internal review, released last fall, found that insufficient supervision, improper collection tradecraft and the deployment of \"untrained, inexperienced\" collectors to Portland was in part to blame for the issues at the time. There was also a leadership shakeup, a scathing whistleblower report and accusations of retaliation. The office has not had a Senate-confirmed leader since David Glawe's departure in May 2020.",

Musk also runs electric car company Tesla (TSLA) and is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine. Twitter and its board, including Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, are also defendants. The lawsuit seeks to delay the merger's closing until at least 2025, declare that Twitter directors breached their fiduciary duties, and recoup legal fees and costs. Twitter declined to comment.

        "input": "Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the approach taken by the Department of Health and Human Services in calculating certain Medicare payments for hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients. The legal challenge targeted HHS' interpretation of the formula used to calculate Medicare's disproportionate share hospital adjustments, known as DSH payments. The high court said that the agency did not misinterpret the law with a policy it rolled out in the mid-2000s that dictated the payments hospitals received for treating a disproportionate share of low-income patients. \"Today, we approve HHS's understanding of the Medicare fraction,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the 5-4 majority, adding that \"HHS's regulation correctly construes the statutory language at issue.\" The case was closely watched for the potential that the conservative wing would use the case to rein in executive agency power, and it is notable that the court declined to do so. The majority was made up of an eclectic coalition of justices, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Amy Coney Barrett signing on to Kagan's opinion. Justice Brett Kavanaugh penned a dissent joined by the remaining members of the court. \"HHS's misreading of the statute has significant real-world effects: It financially harms hospitals that serve low-income patients, thereby hamstringing those hospitals' ability to provide needed care to low-income communities,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"In my view, HHS's 2004 interpretation is not the best reading of this statutory reimbursement provision,\" he added in a brief, 4-page dissent. Empire Health Foundation challenged HHS' interpretation of the Medicare statute that includes a formula used to calculate the payments, arguing that the methodology results in lower payments than the hospitals should receive. Billions of dollars are at stake. The \"disproportionate share hospital adjustments,\" known as DSH payments, are intended to offset hospitals' uncompensated costs for treating for Medicaid and uninsured patients and to improve their access to medical care. The payments also serve to help the financial stability of safety net hospitals that treat mostly lower-income Americans. HHS has changed its interpretation of the DSH payments' statue multiple times. The question in the Empire Health Foundation case is whether the HHS' 2004 interpretation of the rule is consistent with the statutory formula -- or, if the statute is unclear, whether the court should defer to the agency, according to the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. At issue in the case was whether the days patients spend in the hospital after their Medicare Part A benefits expire are factored into the hospital's DSH payment. The Supreme Court last week also said that HHS failed to follow the proper procedures in varying reimbursement rates for Medicare's 340B drug program. This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

In a joint stipulation filed with the court, attorneys for the Trumps and the New York attorney general's office agreed they would delay the deadline for the testimony, which would have been Thursday, to allow them time to prepare. RELATED: How the defense of Trump foretells a possible new GOP era of extremism The delay will also give the Trumps until Monday to seek a stay of the appeal court's ruling requiring them to sit for depositions. Last month a New York appeals court upheld a lower court ruling finding the Trumps needed to comply with the subpoena. If any court finds in favor of Trump, the attorney general's office agreed not to use the testimony in its investigation or any other. Judge orders Trump to submit more sworn statements before formally lifting civil contempt Separately Wednesday, a New York state judge ordered former Trump to produce additional sworn statements about the Trump Organization's document retention and destruction policy before formally purging a civil contempt order. Judge Arthur Engoron said, \"Leaving the contempt order in place is the simplest most effective way to get the job done.\" He has given Trump until June 17 to submit affidavits from the Trump Organization's accounting, marketing, hotel, golf and legal departments explaining the units' document destruction and retention policies. The order followed a feisty hour-long video hearing with Trump's attorney Alina Habba becoming exasperated over the New York attorney general's follow up requests for information related to a December 2021 subpoena for documents. \"We'll continue to comply as we always do. If you'd like an order to make everybody feel better, so be it. Quite honestly the contempt should be purged. My client Donald Trump has given all the information he has,\" Habba told the judge. \"I just don't understand why we're still in contempt.\" In April, Engoron held Trump in civil contempt for failing to comply with the subpoena. He lifted the contempt conditionally last month, freezing the fine at $110,000. Since then both sides have been engaged in a back and forth over whether Trump's further submissions have fully complied with the subpoena. Once Engoron is satisfied, he said, he will purge the civil contempt order. Before the hearing, the attorney general's office submitted records showing what records they have received from Trump that include his handwriting, a point of contention by the attorney general's office which has questioned whether it has been given all of Trump's files. The records were not addressed during the hearing. The word \"Great\" is written on five photos of professional golfers and \"OK\" in block letters with a \"D\" is inked in thick marker across three lease agreements for tenants at 40 Wall Street.

        "input": "Washington (CNN)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waded into fresh controversy on Tuesday with a proclamation honoring the collegiate swimmer who recently placed second to University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title. The Republican governor, already embroiled in a fight with Disney over the state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, claimed that the NCAA is \"perpetuating a fraud\" and declared University of Virginia freshman and Florida native Emma Weyant the \"rightful winner\" of the race. Weyant had finished about 1.75 seconds behind Thomas, who has come to personify the ongoing discourse on trans women's participation in sports and the balance between inclusion and fair play. \"The NCAA is basically taking efforts to destroy women's athletics,\" the Republican governor said in a news conference. \"They're trying to undermine the integrity of the competition and crown someone else.\" The NCAA currently requires trans women athletes to have one year of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to be cleared to participate in women's sports. Thomas said she started HRT in May 2019 and came out as trans that fall, and the NCAA has approved her participation in the women's field. Tuesday's proclamation comes against the backdrop of DeSantis' showdown with Disney over the controversial Florida bill that would ban classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity before fourth grade. A day after Disney CEO Bob Chapek publicly condemned the legislation -- which DeSantis has said he will sign into law -- the Florida governor ripped Disney as a \"woke corporation\" to a room of supporters. Unlike past GOP leaders, DeSantis has been unmoved by corporate pressure or threats of economic boycott over divisive policies. Rather, he has gained a national following by leaning into fights, no matter who is on the receiving end -- a strategy that was on full display Tuesday as he entered the debate sparked by Thomas' win in the women's 500-yard freestyle event. \"In Florida, we reject these lies and recognize Sarasota's Emma Weyant as the best women's swimmer in the 500y freestyle,\" he said in a tweet. While sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person's gender is an innate sense of identity. The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories. For this reason, critics have said the language of \"biological sex,\" as used in DeSantis' proclamation, is overly simplistic and misleading. A 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found \"no direct or consistent research\" on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, at any state of their transition, and critics say postures like DeSantis' will only add to the discrimination that trans people face, particularly trans youth. Still, the debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint in recent years, especially among conservatives. So far this year, Iowa and South Dakota have approved legislation banning transgender women and girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges. And last year, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia enacted similar sports bans, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue conservatives are creating an issue where there isn't one.",

        "input": "(CNN)In an amendment to their lawsuit filed earlier this spring, Gabby Petito's parents allege during the search for the young woman, Brian Laundrie's parents knew their son had killed her and knew \"the whereabouts of her body.\" The amended suit, filed by Petito's parents, alleges the Laundrie family went on vacation to Fort De Soto Park in Florida, while Petito's family was \"extremely distraught\" and attempting to locate her. CNN has previously reported that documents from Pinellas County, Florida, showed Laundrie's mother had made a camping reservation at Fort De Soto Park for the first weekend of September, only to change it to a later date and add another person. Records from the county show the new reservation was made by Roberta Laundrie on September 3, two days after her son returned home. The changed reservation was set to begin on September 6 for three people at Fort De Soto Park, about 75 miles from the family's home. The lawsuit alleges the Laundrie family went on vacation \"knowing that Brian Laundrie had murdered Gabrielle Petito, it is believed that they knew where her body was located, and further knew that Gabrielle Petito's parents were attempting to locate her.\" The Laundrie family attorney told CNN they are confident the case will be dismissed, adding in a statement, \"The allegations in the amended complaint may now conform to proper pleadings but they do not give rise to liability under the law.  Thus, we are still confident the Court will dismiss the action,\" Steven Bertolino said. Petito's remains were found in Teton County, Wyoming, in September, a little more than a week after her family reported her missing. The 22-year-old woman died by strangulation, a coroner ruled. She had been on a cross-country trip with Laundrie, who was her fiance. Laundrie returned to the couple's home on September 1 by himself, and left again roughly two weeks later and disappeared. Laundrie's remains were later found in a Florida reserve and a medical examiner ruled he died by suicide. Nearby, authorities found a notebook in which they said Laundrie claimed responsibility for Petito's death. The suit accuses Laundrie's parents of acting in an \"extreme and outrageous way\" for several reasons, including for failing to inform Petito's parents that she was dead and where her remains were located and taking a vacation with their son while the Petito family searched for the young woman. There is no specific monetary amount listed on the lawsuit, but Petito's parents are asking for damages that exceed $30,000.",

After being introduced and presented with the award by his daughter, Woods kicked off his speech emotionally: \"Thank you. Crap, I just lost a bet to [golfer Steve] Stricker that I wouldn't cry. Thank you, Sam.\" Woods then recalled the sacrifices of his parents, and the racism he faced as a young golfer. \"One of the things that Dad had instilled in me is that he grew up in an era, same era as Charlie Sifford [the first Black golfer to play on the PGA Tour] and why my son is named after Charlie, is that you had to be twice as good to be given half a chance,\" he said. \"I was not allowed in the clubhouses where all the other juniors were. The color of my skin dictated that. As I got older, that drove me even more. \"So, as I was denied access into the clubhouses, that's fine. Put my shoes on here in the parking lot. I asked two questions only, that was it: where was the first tee and what was the course record.\" During his career, Woods has broken many golfing records, establishing himself as arguably the greatest golfer of all time. He has won 15 majors -- surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus' 18 -- as well as a joint-record 82 wins on the PGA Tour. The American took 359 starts to achieve this milestone, according to the PGA Tour Stats Report, making for a record win percentage of 22.80%. Woods has not played on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Masters after sustaining serious injuries from a car crash in February 2021. While he is yet to set a date for his return to the Tour, he played with his son Charlie at the PNC Championship in December, finishing second. The importance of his family featured throughout Woods' acceptance speech. \"I know that golf is an individual sport, we do things on our own a lot for hours on end, but I didn't get here alone,\" he said. \"I had unbelievable parents, mentors, friends who supported me in the darkest of times and celebrated the highest of times. All of you allowed me to get here and I want to say thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.\" The ceremony also inducted former PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem, four-time major winner Susie Maxwell and course designer and architect Marion Hollins into the Golf Hall of Fame.",

        "input": "(CNN)Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak, who has been widely criticized outside Russia for wearing a pro-war symbol on a podium next to a Ukrainian athlete, says he would \"do exactly the same\" if given another chance , according to Russian state media. The 20-year-old was condemned by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for his \"shocking behavior\" at a gymnastics World Cup event in Doha, Qatar, last weekend. Kuliak wore a 'Z' symbol taped to his leotard while standing next to Ukrainian gymnast  Illia Kovtun on the podium -- Kovtun won gold and Kuliak picked up bronze in the parallel bars on Saturday. The 'Z' insignia has been displayed on tanks and vehicles used by the Russian military in its Ukraine operations and has since become a symbol of support for the invasion of Ukraine. Propaganda videos on social media appear to show supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin  wearing clothing featuring the 'Z' symbol, waving Russian flags and chanting pro-Russia slogans. \"If there was a second chance and I would again have to choose whether to go out with the letter 'Z' on my chest or not, I would do exactly the same,\" Kuliak is quoted as saying in Russia-controlled media outlet Russia Today.   \"I saw it with our military and looked at what this symbol means. It turned out [it means], 'for victory' and 'for peace.' \"I didn't wish anything bad on anyone, I just showed my position. As an athlete, I will always fight for victory and stand for peace.\" READ: Basketball star Brittney Griner is the latest American to be detained in Russia Having received expressions of support from the head of  his sport's governing body in Russia, the Artistic Gymnastics Federation of Russia (FSGR), Vasily Titov, Kuliak says he was annoyed by the Ukrainian athletes when they displayed their national flag at the event in Doha. Per FIG regulations  at the time, Russian gymnasts at the event were only allowed to compete as neutral athletes and could not display any national symbols. The FIG confirmed  in a statement it would ask the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF) to open disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak. The GEF told CNN that it couldn't comment on pending or potential cases as a matter of procedure. Since Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, including judges, are not allowed to take part in official FIG-sanctioned competitions following advice from the International Olympic Committee. It comes as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi estimates that  at least  two million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24, as fighting continues across the country.",

The mayor signed the emergency executive order which will empower the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to prevent price gouging for formula, a Sunday statement from his office announced. \"The nationwide infant formula shortage has caused unimaginable pain and anxiety for families across New York -- and we must act with urgency,\" Adams said in the statement. \"This emergency executive order will help us to crack down on any retailer looking to capitalize on this crisis by jacking up prices on this essential good. Our message to struggling mothers and families is simple: Our city will do everything in its power to assist you during this challenging period.\" More than 40% of retailers in the tristate area are out of stock of formula, said the mayor. CNN scanned large retailers in three New York City boroughs on Sunday for formula -- with mixed results. Two large supermarkets in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, had no formula on the shelves. A worker at one of those retailers told CNN some formula is kept \"in the back office.\" In Long Island City, Queens, a CVS was cleaned out except for six containers of Similac Alimentum, priced at $14.49 each. A smaller grocery store across the street in Long Island City with an otherwise very full section of baby food had only four cans of Similac For Spit-Up priced at $25.99 each. At a Target store in midtown Manhattan, the shelves were almost cleaned out except for three containers of Similac Alimentum priced at $14.69 each and three larger boxes of Enfamil Neuropro Sensitive. There were also a few varieties of toddler formula available. A sign warned customers that \"due to the industry-wide formula shortage, select formula items and sizes are currently not being produced,\" and directed shoppers to the company's website. \"The nationwide infant formula shortage is hurting parents and families across our city at a time when we're all still reeling from the crisis of past two years,\" said New York's Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom in the statement. New Yorkers who are overcharged for formula can file a complaint with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.",

        "input": "(CNN)Mortgage rates fell slightly this week, marking the third consecutive week of declines. But with rates hovering above 5% and home prices well above where they were this time last year, prospective buyers are finding it increasingly difficult to afford a home. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.09% in the week ending June 2, down from 5.10% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. It is still well above the 2.99% average from this time last year. \"Mortgage rates continued to inch downward this week but are still significantly higher than last year, affecting affordability and purchase demand,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. \"Heading into the summer, the potential homebuyer pool has shrunk, supply is on the rise and the housing market is normalizing. This is welcome news following unprecedented market tightness over the last couple years.\" Rising prices had already been pushing many prospective buyers to the sidelines. But as rates continued to rise this year, even more home shoppers have put their search on hold. \"The relentless rise in home prices and recent increase in interest rates slowed down buyer activity in April as shown by a month-over-month drop in existing home sales, new home sales, and pending home sales, as some buyers opted out of the market altogether,\" said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst at Realtor.com. \"Still, home buyers continued to contend with record-high home prices in May.\" At the end of May 2021, a buyer who put 20% down on a $375,500 home -- a price just below the median price for an existing home -- and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 2.99% had a monthly mortgage payment of principal and interest of $1,265, according to numbers from Freddie Mac. Today, a homeowner buying the same price house with an average rate of 5.09% would pay $1,629 a month in principal and interest. That is $364 more each month and $131,147 more in cumulative interest payments over the life of the loan, according to numbers from Freddie Mac. But, said Jones, there may be good news ahead with more homes coming onto the market. \"While inventory is still low by historical standards, it is starting to tilt in a more buyer-friendly direction,\" she said. \"This is likely to lead to slower price growth in the not-so-distant future as sellers compete for buyers, finally creating a more balanced market.\" Will mortgage rates keep climbing? Still, many buyers can't afford to buy a home that fits their needs with mortgage rates so high. \"Those who are currently home shopping will tell you that we're not there yet, as still-high interest rates and home prices are creating challenges in finding their ideal home,\" said Jones. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-Year US Treasury bonds. However, rates remained mostly flat last week even with an increase in 10-year Treasury yields. But rates are also indirectly impacted by the Federal Reserve's actions. The Fed has been seeking to tame inflation by raising interest rates over the past couple of months. And the central bank has signaled there are more rate hikes to come. Earlier this week, President Joe Biden met with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and voiced his support of the Fed's actions to rein in inflation and pledged to refrain from influencing interest rate decisions.",

        "input": "(CNN)The leaders of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus are ramping up pressure on their leadership in a new effort to bring a series of bills to the House floor that they argue already have bipartisan backing and could help bolster incumbents ahead of the midterm elections from attacks that Congress isn't working. In their plan, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania call on their leadership to move ahead on seven areas, including an energy plan aimed at helping to lower gas prices, legislation to invest in law enforcement, a bill to support veterans' mental health, lower prescription drug costs and invest in cancer research, and a more controversial push to block the administration on a key immigration decision. It's the latest example of members running for reelection in some of the toughest districts in the country trying to get major legislation across the finish line before the politics of the midterm election year overshadow what's possible on the floor. It also comes as efforts to resurrect a Democratic-only package on energy, taxes and prescription drugs seem tenuous at best in the US Senate. \"We need to focus on commonsense, bipartisan action that can actually get done and bring folks together,\" Gottheimer said. \"That's what I hear from folks back home. These are all areas where both sides can come together and actually get stuff done.\" The areas include several bipartisan pieces of legislation that members have already worked together on, bills that Gottheimer argues would have a good chance of passing of only they were to come to the floor for a vote. The members also call on leadership to move swiftly to block the administration's decision to end Title 42 on May 23, a flashpoint between some Democrats on Capitol Hill and the administration. The Trump-era immigration order, which has been used under former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, has allowed border officials to swiftly send migrants back to their home countries, citing a public health crisis. The order is expected to be reversed at the end of May, but the decision to end it has frustrated some front-line Democratic members, who have argued the administration still doesn't have a sufficient plan to deal with an expected uptick in migration once the order ends. Many of the moderate Democrats up for reelection have been hammered back home by Republican attacks on immigration. The issue of Title 42 has become a major flashpoint in the Senate, where the immigration policy delayed the passage of a $10 billion Covid-19 relief package before the recess. Republicans had insisted on a vote on an amendment that would have blocked the administration from ending the policy. But Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had refused to allow the amendment on the floor, arguing that the immigration policy and Covid-19 funding were separate issues. Moving ahead to block the administration on Title 42 would certainly be met with strong opposition from some progressives, who had been pushing the administration for months on the issue.",

        "input": "Davos, Switzerland (CNN Business)Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, hadn't left the country since Russia invaded three months ago. But he traveled hundreds of miles from Kyiv to Davos, Switzerland, to send a message to some of the world's biggest technology companies: We need you to do more. Fedorov said in an interview with CNN Business that he met directly with Nick Clegg, head of global affairs at Meta, Facebook's (FB) parent company, at the World Economic Forum. He also had meetings with representatives from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). \"Each of us can do even better,\" he said. Almost 500 tech companies have left Russia since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, by Fedorov's count. But he called out tech firms Cloudflare and SAP for continuing to operate in Russia, which he said undermines the effectiveness of the \"digital blockade.\" \"When a company is working in the Russian market, it pumps funds into the Russian budget from which money gets to the Russian army. This enables killing Ukrainians,\" Fedorov said. Germany's SAP, which makes business software, said in April it planned to exit Russia. But Fedorov said the company is slow-walking its departure and needs to move faster. \"I'm convinced eventually they will leave Russia, sooner or later   but sooner [is better] than later, because people are getting killed,\" he said. SAP said in a statement to CNN Business that it's having \"an ongoing dialogue with the Ukrainian government, which included conversations at Davos.\" \"SAP has stood in solidarity with the Ukrainians since the start of Russia's unjustified war, including by initiating the closure of our direct business in Russia and providing significant technological and humanitarian aid to Ukraine,\" the company said. \"The principles guiding our decisions included fully implementing sanctions as a responsible member of the global community, as well as going beyond those sanctions where and how we could.\" Cloudflare, meanwhile, has said it is still operating in Russia in order to protect the flow of uncensored information to Russians. \"They say they allegedly are there to defend some kind of democracy,\" Fedorov said. In a statement, the cloud services operator said it \"has minimal sales and commercial activity in Russia\" and has \"terminated any customers we have identified as tied to sanctioned entities.\" It said it \"has also worked diligently and donated services for free to Ukrainian websites, networks and critical infrastructure to help them stay online and secure.\" Fedorov emphasized that a \"digital blockade\" is an important tool to fight back against Russia, since it can set the country back \"two or three decades,\" encouraging engineers and other specialists to leave. \"We also want people in Russia to understand that 'Guys, something is wrong.' And they have to stand up against war,\" Fedorov added. In meetings with Meta and Google, Fedorov said he discussed countering disinformation, blocking propaganda channels and creating \"a green corridor\" for information from Ukrainian media outlets and bloggers so it doesn't get blocked. Ukraine's digital ministry also continues to push for direct donations to support the defense and reconstruction of the country. At Ukraine House, the delegation's hub in Davos, visitors can contribute via credit card, bank transfer or PayPal, or with cryptocurrency. On Wednesday, Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian winner of this year's Eurovision song contest, announced that it was raffling off its trophy to the highest bidder to raise money for Ukraine's military. Bids can be made in crypto. The recent rout in crypto markets has hurt the Ukrainian government's fundraising efforts. Fedorov said that a few weeks ago, the government had brought in about $70 million in crypto. Now, that number is between $60 million and $65 million, he estimated.",

        "input": "London (CNN Business)Russia's richest businessman has warned the Kremlin against confiscating assets of companies that have fled in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, saying such a step would set the country back more than 100 years. Vladimir Potanin, president of metals giant Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) and its biggest shareholder, said that Russia risked returning to the tumultuous days of the 1917 revolution if it slammed the door on Western companies and investors. He urged the Russian government to proceed with extreme caution regarding the seizure of assets. \"Firstly, it would take us back a hundred years, to 1917, and the consequences of such a step   global distrust of Russia on the part of investors   we would experience for many decades,\" he said in a message posted on Norilsk Nickel's Telegram account on Thursday. \"Secondly, the decision of many companies to suspend operations in Russia is, I would say, somewhat emotional in nature and may have been taken as a result of unprecedented pressure on them from public opinion abroad. So most likely they will come back. And personally, I would keep such an opportunity for them,\" he added. Potanin is Russia's wealthiest billionaire and still worth about $22.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, despite losing about a quarter of his fortune this year as shares in Norilsk Nickel crashed. The company's shares lost more than 90% in London trading before they were suspended this month, despite soaring prices for its commodities. Norilsk Nickel is the world's largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, as well as a major producer of platinum and copper. The company and its primary products have escaped punishing sanctions imposed by Western countries that have slammed the Russian economy. Dozens of American, European and Japanese companies have abandoned joint ventures, factories, stores, offices and other assets in the past two weeks in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions. They were joined by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan on Thursday, the first major Western banks to announce they will quit Russia completely since the crisis erupted in February. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he backed a plan to introduce \"external management\" of foreign companies leaving Russia. \"We need to act decisively with those [companies] who are going to close their production,\" Putin said according to a video posted by the Kremlin and aired on state media. \"It is necessary, then ... to introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who want to work,\" he added. Russia's consumer rights organization has drawn up a list of companies that have decided to leave and could be nationalized, according to a report in Russian newspaper Izvestiya later cited by state news agency TASS. The document that was reportedly sent to the Russian government and the Prosecutor General's Office, includes 59 companies, including Volkswagen, Apple, IKEA, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonald's, Porsche, Toyota, H&M, and can be updated with more brands, Izvestiya said. Potanin said it wasn't particularly expedient to talk about nationalizing Western assets, but the Kremlin's proposal could allow \"owners to keep property, and companies to avoid collapse, continue to produce products and pay money to employees.\" \"I understand that in light of the economic restrictions directed against Russia, there may be an understandable desire to act symmetrically,\" he wrote. \"But on the example of Western countries, we see that the economies of these countries suffer from the imposition of sanctions against Russia. We must be wiser and avoid a scenario where retaliatory sanctions hit ourselves.\" He also called for Russia to ease restrictions on foreign currency so that interest could be paid on foreign bonds and loans. Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion.",

        "input": "(CNN)A Singapore court on Tuesday rejected a final appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking, following a campaign by his lawyers who said the trial violated international laws as the man has intellectual disabilities. The ruling ends all legal avenues to stop his execution and supporters say he could be hanged within days. The case has drawn international attention -- including from the United Nations, Malaysia's Prime Minister and British billionaire Richard Branson -- and put the city-state's zero-tolerance drug laws back under scrutiny. Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a 34-year-old Malaysian citizen, was arrested in 2009 for bringing 42.7 grams (1.5 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2010. He appealed on the basis of mental disability and for his lawyers to start judicial review proceedings to halt the death sentence. \"The Court of Appeal has just dismissed the application and considered the appeal an abuse of process and that international law does not apply. Nagaenthran who is mentally disabled is due to be hanged possibly in the next few days,\" said M. Ravi, who was part of Dharmalingam's legal team, in a Facebook post Tuesday. In his ruling, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said there was \"no admissible evidence showing any decline in the appellant's mental condition after the commission of the offense.\" \"The case mounted by the appellant's counsel was baseless and without merit, both as a matter of fact and of law,\" Menon said, according to court documents. The court also dismissed a request for Dharmalingam to be assessed by an independent panel of psychiatrists. After his family were notified of his impending execution in October 2021, Dharmalingam's lawyers launched a last-minute constitutional challenge. The High Court dismissed their bid in November but granted a stay of execution so the decision could be appealed. That appeal hearing was then postponed because Dharmalingam contracted Covid-19. Tuesday's verdict on the appeal exhausts Dharmalingam's legal options. Anti-death penalty group Reprieve said Dharmalingam is facing imminent execution unless he is pardoned by Singapore's President Halimah Yacob. \"We are extremely concerned about rushed hearings and decisions in this case, in violation of Nagaenthran's fair trial rights. Nagaenthran should be protected from the death penalty because of his intellectual disability,\" Reprieve director Maya Foa said in a statement. \"The heart-wrenching fact that he believes he is going home to his family and talks about sharing home-cooked meals with them shows that he does not fully understand he faces execution and lacks the mental competency to be executed.\" Death sentence Singapore has some of the strictest drug laws in the world. Trafficking a certain amount of drugs -- for example, 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin -- results in a mandatory death sentence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. It was only recently -- and after Dharmalingam's case began -- that the law was amended to allow for a convicted person to escape the death penalty in certain circumstances. Dharmalingam's lawyers argued he should not have been sentenced to death under Singaporean law because he was incapable of understanding his actions. They said a psychologist assessed his IQ to be 69, which is internationally recognized as an intellectual disability. At his trial, the defense also argued he had severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline intellectual functioning, and severe alcohol use disorder. Dharmalingam has spent a decade on death row and during that time his condition further deteriorated, his lawyers said. \"He has not a very good sense of what is happening around him,\" N. Surendran, a Malaysian lawyer who is representing Dharmalingam's family, and adviser to Malaysian NGO Lawyers for Liberty, said in November. \"He is disoriented. He's got no real clue of what is going to happen to him.\" Surendran said executing Dharmalingam \"would be tantamount to executing a child.\" The court on Tuesday, however, said there was no admissible evidence showing any decline in Dharmalingam's mental condition. The judge ruled the lawyers' assertions of Dharmalingam's mental decline were \"self-serving\" and \"not supported by anything at all.\" Menon, the chief justice, said the defense proceedings were carried in a way intended to delay the execution, according to court documents. In January, rights group Amnesty International called the trial \"a travesty of justice\" and \"unlawful under international law.\" \"This includes the fact his sentence was imposed as a mandatory punishment and for an offense that does not meet the threshold of the 'most serious crimes' to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international law,\" Amnesty said.",

        "input": "(CNN)The parents of a 19-year-old man who was fatally shot by Pennsylvania state troopers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit, accusing troopers and two local prosecutors of attempting to \"coverup\" evidence the young man was pointing a pellet gun in the air when he was killed. Citing police statements at the time, lawyers for the parents say Christian Hall was having a mental health emergency on December 30, 2020, when he was shot on an interstate overpass in Monroe County following a 90-minute standoff that was captured on video. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, accuses state police officials -- including Commissioner Robert Evanchick -- and prosecutors of protecting the troopers by intentionally misleading the public about details of the shooting. Hall was standing in what the lawsuit called \"the universal stance of surrender\" -- with the gun pointed in the air -- when he was fatally shot. The lawsuit includes still images of Hall appearing to have his hands up at an angle as troopers pointed guns at him from behind their vehicle. The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) declined to comment on pending litigation. Monroe County District Attorney David Christian and Michael Mancuso, First Assistant District Attorney, are also named in the lawsuit. The state police statement issued the day of the shooting -- included in the lawsuit -- said Hall \"retrieved the firearm and began walking towards the Troopers. At which time, Hall pointed the firearm in the Troopers direction. As a result, Troopers fired striking Hall.\" The lawsuit said a video and audio recording of the shooting \"was redacted and pixelated\" and \"misleads the viewer into believing that ... Christian pointed the perceived handgun at Troopers while advancing on Troopers.\" Hall family attorney Devon Jacob subpoenaed unedited video of the encounter from the state police. The unredacted video obtained by Hall family attorneys shows the young man \"kept his hands in the air even while bullets were impacting his body\" and provides \"undisputed evidence\" of an attempt to \"coverup the unlawfulness of the homicide,\" according to the lawsuit. Mancuso, in a statement, said the lawsuit failed to state a valid claim against prosecutors. \"The circumstances surrounding the use of deadly force demonstrate that such force was justified under the circumstances known to the officers,\" Mancuso said. \"The attempts by the attorneys to mislead the public and now the filing of a frivolous suit against the DA's Office is yet another example that they are motivated not by the pursuit of justice but the allure of monetary gain,\" he added. Mancuso said the DA conducted an \"independent investigation\" into the shooting and the state police's own probe \"did not interfere or impede the DA's investigation.\" The statement called Hall's death a \"tragic incident\" that \"was not due to the unjustified use of deadly force by law enforcement.\" Attorneys Ben Crump and Jacob, who are representing Hall's parents, Gareth and Fe, said in a statement: \"What happened to Christian and his parents is not excusable. Government should always be accountable to the people.\" The lawsuit said the state police issued a \"false statement\" intended \"to thwart public oversight and pressure\" and \"undermine the homicide investigation.\" The suit also said local prosecutors created a misleading PowerPoint presentation \"to support the PSP's factually incorrect statement.\" In November, CNN reviewed the unedited video -- provided by Jacob -- and Hall is not seen pointing his weapon at police, as state police stated in their December 2020 statement, before troopers fired on him. The state police did not respond to a request for comment at the time. Hall does, as police and the DA's office described, ignore dozens of police orders to drop his weapon. After what appears to be warning shots fired by one of the officers, \"Hall then raises the gun outward toward his side and then upwards by bending his elbow at a ninety-degree angle,\" according to the DA's report, CNN reported in November. \"After ignoring further commands to drop the gun, both Corporal #1 and Trooper #1 fire a total of approximately eight shots striking Hall who falls to the roadway,\" the DA's report stated. The edited version of the video released by the DA's office in March blurred the moment of Hall's death, but his physical gestures and actions appeared to be accurately reflected in their report, according to CNN's review. The troopers were responding to \"a report of a distraught and suicidal male\" standing on a bridge in Hamilton Township. \"If he doesn't drop it, just take him,\" the lawsuit quoted one of the troopers as saying.",

        "input": "New York  (CNN Business)As Russia's assault on Ukraine continues, American bar and restaurant owners are hoping a small word change will help show their solidarity with the Ukrainian people. In a move reminiscent of the \"freedom fries\" fad of the early aughts, they're taking Moscow Mules off the menu and replacing them with Kyiv Mules. Small American businesses, such as independent bar or restaurant owners, may not have any direct business ties to Russia, but many feel strongly about the violent attack on Ukrainian cities and citizens. Replacing \"Moscow\" with \"Kyiv\" in their vodka-ginger-lime cocktails is one way to show support for Ukraine. Bond Bar, in San Francisco, has renamed its Moscow Mule the Kyiv Mule. \"It's just a little token of acknowledgment to the Ukrainian people,\" said owner Andrea Minoo. \"We're just trying to raise awareness, and to let people know, we're in support [of Ukraine].\"  She wants Ukrainians to know that \"we see what's happening, we wish we could do more.\" Bond Bar doesn't serve Russian vodka, Minoo noted, so it's not replacing any ingredients in its Kyiv Mule. Madrone Art Bar, also in San Francisco, did serve Russian vodka until this past weekend, when owner Michael Krouse decided to take it off the menu. First, he had to figure out which of the roughly 10 vodkas he carries were actually Russian. Many top-selling vodka brands that trace their origins to Russia are now distilled in multiple countries, including the United States. Stoli Vodka, for example, is actually made in Latvia, and the company's headquarters are in Luxembourg. After some research, Krouse removed Russian Standard, one of the few vodka brands that actually is Russian-made, from his bar. Then he decided to rename Madrone's Moscow Mule the Kyiv Mule and looked for a Ukrainian vodka to make it with. The bar unveiled the reconstituted cocktail on Instagram this week. \"Introducing the 'Kyiv Mule' made with Prime Ukrainian vodka!,'\" a Wednesday post reads, adding that  \"$2 of each Kyiv Mule sale will be donated to the Ukraine Crisis Fund.\" The Kyiv Mule costs $12. Krouse said he was feeling sad and helpless about the situation in Ukraine when he decided to make those moves. Those changes were \"at least something that we could do,\" he said. Making a gesture Em Chamas Brazilian Grill in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a Facebook post last week that its Moscow Mule will be replaced by a \"Snake Island Mule,\" in \"support of the Ukrainian resistance and in honor of the brave soldiers of Snake Island.\" Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, sits about 30 miles off the southern tip of the Ukrainian mainland in the northwestern Black Sea. Last week, a handful of Ukrainian fighters on the island stood up to Russian warships. They were feared dead, but the Ukrainian Navy released a statement Monday saying the troops were \"alive and well\" after being forced to surrender \"due to the lack of ammunition.\" Back in Kansas City, the Em Chamas post also urged customers against \"directing animosity towards local restaurants or businesses that are Russian-themed and/or are owned/operated by those of Russian [descent].\" The eatery, which charges about $11 for cocktails, plans to donate profits from the Snake Island Mule to a Ukrainian charity, according to the Facebook post. Ronnie Heckman, owner of Caddies on Cordell, a bar and grill in Bethesda, Maryland, has not only swapped out Moscow Mules for Kyiv Mules, he's gone so far to replace Black Russians and White Russians with Black Ukrainians (vodka and Kahlua on the rocks) and White Ukrainians (made with vodka, Kahlua and cream). \"It's a gesture,\" he said. Caddies is also donating part of the revenue from those drinks to Ukrainian aid, he said. Heckman hopes that if enough restaurant and bar owners take references to Russia off their menus, they can send a message to Russian leadership. The attack on Ukraine \"makes no sense,\" he said. \"It's wrong.\"   CNN's Jordan Valinsky, Brad Lendon, Tim Lister and Josh Pennington contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN)Kudos to the Paramount marketing department, because every good scene in \"The Lost City\" can be found in the preview trailer, and it's pretty slim pickings beyond that. A romantic-comedy/action vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, the movie's throwback feel is breezy but barely enough to justify \"Lost\" being found. At first blush the derivative streak actually seems almost like an asset, evoking shorthand memories of \"Romancing the Stone,\" another story about a romance novelist forced out of her comfort zone and into an exotic adventure that resembles her windblown stories. The twist here, on its face fertile but not particularly as executed, is that the plot throws her together with the Fabio-like cover model from her 20 books, a muscled fellow named Alan (Tatum), who has harbored thinly veiled feelings for Bullock's widowed Loretta Sage even though she dismisses him as a shallow himbo. The two meet up promoting Loretta's latest book, which she wants to mark the final entry in the series. But her background as an academic has led to her incorporating references to a priceless treasure that garner the attention of a wealthy heir, Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe, a bit of casting that doesn't turn out to be as inspired as it looked), who thinks she's the only person who can help him locate the Hitchcockian MacGuffin. Soon enough, Loretta and Alan are in survival mode on a remote island, trying to evade Fairfax and his minions. While Alan might look the part, he's woefully out of his element, eager to be perceived as a hero in her eyes -- \"I want her to see me as more than a cover model,\" he says, for anyone who missed the point -- but understandably terrified being shot at and chased. As promising as that sounds, the result is for the most part pretty flat. Enlivened briefly by Brad Pitt's cameo as the savvy rescuer that Alan initially enlists, the rest mostly boils down to Bullock and Tatum bantering and bickering, weathering enough near-fatal encounters to create the requisite adrenaline to bring them closer together. Directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, who collaborated on the script with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, \"The Lost City\" owes its most direct debt to \"Romancing the Stone\" but recalls any number of romantic pairings in exotic locales, a la \"Six Days, Seven Nights.\" Yet it's the uninspired writing, more than the general template, that keeps the movie from finding its stride. On the plus side, the scenery's nice, and for those who've already seen \"The Batman\" there's nothing wrong with a little mindless escapism. In that sense, it's not that the movie's bad, but rather given the elements and that aforementioned trailer, that it could have been so much better; instead, they built this \"City\" on a flimsy foundation. \"Jungles eat people like us,\" Loretta tells Alan. Underdeveloped scripts, it turns out, do too. \"The Lost City\" premieres March 25 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",

        "input": "(CNN)A federal appeals court struck down a California law prohibiting sales of semiautomatic firearms to anyone under 21 years of age, according to a decision filed Wednesday. The law, which had been in effect since July 1, 2021, also restricted purchases of semiautomatic weapons to one per month for all ages. Judge Ryan D. Nelson of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in his opinion that the law infringed on the Second Amendment rights of those ages 18 to 21. \"America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army. Today we reaffirm that our Constitution still protects the right that enabled their sacrifice: the right of young adults to keep and bear arms,\" Nelson wrote. Judge Kenneth K. Lee concurred, writing, \"We cannot allow good intentions to trump an enumerated and 'fundamental right' deeply rooted in the history and tradition of this country.\" State Attorney General Rob Bonta's office said it was reviewing the 2-1 decision. \"California will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent and reduce gun violence. We remain committed to defending California's commonsense gun laws, which save lives and make our communities safer,\" a statement from his office read. The Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights nonprofit, was among the groups that brought the case. \"Today's decision confirms that peaceable legal adults cannot be prohibited from acquiring firearms and exercising their rights enshrined in the Second Amendment,\" Adam Kraut, coalition vice president of programs, said in a statement. The decision did not affect an existing California law that requires adults over 18 but under 21 years of age to have a valid hunting license to purchase rifles or shotguns. California Sen. Anthony Portantino, who authored both bills, said in a statement to CNN, \"Though I'm disappointed to have the semiautomatic centerfire rifle provisions struck down by the court, I'm pleased that the general provisions of SB 1100, raising the firearm purchase age to 21, is still the law in California. I remain committed to keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. Student safety on our campuses is something we should all rally behind and sensible gun control is part of that solution.\"",

        "input": "(CNN)An unidentified child who was found dead in a suitcase last month in southern Indiana died from electrolyte imbalance, officials said Friday. The autopsy of the boy, believed to be about 5 years old, shows that the electrolyte imbalance was likely caused by viral gastroenteritis, the Indiana State Police said in a news release. The condition is otherwise known as vomiting and diarrhea, which can eventually lead to dehydration, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The boy's blood toxicology was negative, the news release said. The autopsy report also indicated there was no significant traumatic injuries, meaning there was no anatomical cause of death, the police said. \"Detectives also stated they have no evidence which leads them to believe the child was alive when placed into the suitcase, and that the child was clothed and clean,\" police said in the news release. The child's body was found in rural Washington County inside a hard-shell suitcase with a \"distinctive Las Vegas design on its front and back,\" police said at the time. State police were called to investigate after a resident who was mushroom hunting discovered the suitcase on April 16 and immediately called 911, the agency said. Since then, police have been seeking the public's help to identify the boy, who was described as Black, between 5 and 8 years old, about 4 feet tall, with a slim build and a short haircut. Police said the child died at some point within the week prior to his body being discovered. Police said they received hundreds of calls so far, but still to no avail in identifying the boy. \"Investigators are not ruling out the possibility that the child could be from out of state or even out of the country,\" police said. Police are looking for people who might have first-hand knowledge that could lead to the child's identification and clarity on the circumstances of his death, Sgt. Carey Huls with the Indiana State Police told CNN earlier this month. Investigators hope the photo of the suitcase will lead to tips. Those who have information can call the toll-free tip line 1-888-437-643.",

Biden told reporters earlier Sunday he had \"not yet\" spoken with victims' families and was \"trying to work out the schedule\" to make a trip to the area. He also spoke by phone with Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday. Biden expressed condolences for the families during remarks Sunday at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and said he was receiving regular briefings from his team. \"We're still gathering the facts, but already, the Justice Department has stated publicly that it's investigating the matter as a hate crime, racially-motivated act of white supremacy and violent extremism. As they do, we must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America. Our hearts are heavy once again, but our resolve must never waver,\" the President said Sunday. The 18-year-old suspected of opening fire at a Tops Friendly Markets store in a predominantly Black neighborhood told authorities he was targeting the Black community, according to an official familiar with the investigation. The alleged gunman made disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, the official said. He traveled from another New York county hours away and livestreamed the attack on the social media platform Twitch. The US Department of Justice is investigating the mass shooting \"as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism,\" according to a statement from US Attorney General Merrick Garland. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, Stephen Belongia, special agent in charge of the FBI Buffalo field office, said at a news conference after the shooting. Saturday's massacre in Buffalo is the latest high-profile mass shooting in which authorities have said the suspect was motivated by hate, including attacks at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh; Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Biden had condemned the shooting in Buffalo in a statement on Saturday night. \"Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America,\" he said. \"Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.\" This story has been updated with additional details.",

Zelensky will appear via video conference and be introduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after she gavels in the session. He is expected to speak for approximately 15 minutes. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the expected appearance in a letter to members on Monday, writing that \"as war rages on in Ukraine, it is with great respect and admiration for the Ukrainian people that we invite all Members of the House and Senate to attend\" the address. There is widespread bipartisan support among US lawmakers for aid to Ukraine. Zelensky is likely to make fresh calls for steps like a no-fly zone and help acquiring fighter jets in his address to lawmakers. President Joe Biden has so far rejected those steps as potentially dragging the US into conflict with Russia, but, according to the White House, the President is intent on demonstrating the support the US is providing and will detail it in a separate speech later Wednesday. What time is the Ukrainian President's address? Zelensky's remarks are set to air live at 9 a.m. ET. Where can I watch it? A livestream of Zelensky's speech to Congress will be featured on CNN.com without requiring a login.

        "input": "(CNN)The accused Colombian narco-trafficker Dairo Usuga, also known by the alias \"Otoniel,\" was extradited to the United States on Wednesday to face drug trafficking charges, a source within the Colombian National Police told CNN. On Thursday, he pleaded not guilty to charges of participating in an international cocaine manufacturing and distribution conspiracy, among other charges, in federal court in New York City. Usuga is widely considered to be the boss of the \"Clan del Golfo,\" a powerful drug cartel that controls cocaine routes into Mexico and the United States. He is being held at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City. Usuga was charged in a three-count superseding indictment with leading a continuing criminal enterprise from June 2003 through October 2021 and participating in an international conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine, knowing and intending that the narcotics would be illegally imported into the US, according to the indictment. Usuga was captured by Colombian authorities in October in a rural area of the northwestern Uraba region in Antioquia province, a feat President Ivan Duque celebrated as \"the biggest arrest of a narco-trafficker by the Colombian police since the days of Pablo Escobar.\" At the time of his arrest, the alleged cartel leader was facing at least 122 charges for drug trafficking, criminal association, murder and money laundering, according to the Colombian Attorney General's office. His extradition was approved by presidential decree after the Colombian State Council denied an appeal by several victims of Usuga's alleged crimes who wished to see him tried in Colombian court. The State Department previously offered up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction. The so-called Clan del Golfo consists of former members of terrorist organizations and \"uses violence and intimidation to control the narcotics trafficking routes, cocaine processing laboratories, speedboat departure points, and clandestine landing strips,\" according to the State Department. On Thursday, at least one person was killed in Cerete, northwestern Colombia, amid an escalation of violence in several Colombian districts, the country's Ombudsman Carlos Camargo said in a statement. The escalation follows the imposition of an armed curfew by a powerful drug cartel in retaliation for the extradition to the United States of Dairo Usuga, also known as \"Otoniel,\" he said. Early on Thursday, pamphlets allegedly from the Clan del Golfo began circulating on Colombian social media calling for citizens in several departments in northwestern Colombia to stay home and suspend any economic activity in the area for four days due to Duque's order to extradite Usuga.",

Clayton was 67. \"John was a pioneer as an NFL insider but also one of the kindest men you could ever work with,'' ESPN vice president and executive producer Seth Markman said, according to the network. \"He literally never said no to a show that asked him to come on -- from 6 a.m. to midnight, if you asked for the Professor, he was there for you. I'll also personally remember how he loved and cared for his beloved wife Pat as she has battled multiple sclerosis. We will all miss John greatly.'' Clayton, a native of Pittsburgh, began his sports reporting career in 1972 covering the Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Sports reported. \"We are very saddened to learn of the passing of John Clayton,\" the Steelers said in a tweet. \"He was a Pittsburgh media icon who covered the Steelers for over a decade in the 1970s and 1980s ... Our thoughts are with his wife, Pat, during this difficult time.\" Later in his career, Clayton would cover the Seattle Seahawks for the Tacoma News Tribune, said the Seahawks, who said they were \"heartbroken\" to have learned of his passing. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, of which Clayton was a selection committee member, expressed its condolences on Instagram, saying Clayton's, \"impact and contribution to the game of football will be missed.\" Russell Wilson, the former star quarterback for the Seahawks, said he would miss Clayton's \"words and brilliance.\"",

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)Theaters needed a hero, and they got one in a big way this weekend. \"The Batman\"   which stars Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader and Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman   notched an estimated $128.5 million at the North American box office this weekend, according to its studio Warner Bros. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.) The opening flew past industry expectations that had the movie making closer to $100 million. It stands as the best opening of 2022 so far. The total also represents one of the largest openings for the Dark Knight. And that's saying something considering that Batman is one of cinema's most popular brands. Films based on the character have hauled in more than $5 billion at the worldwide box office since 1989's \"Batman.\" On a symbolic level, this type of opening is exactly what both Warner Bros. and theaters needed right now. For the studio, \"The Batman\" marks a return to the exclusive theatrical experience following a year of releasing films on its streaming service, HBO Max, and in theaters at the same time. This weekend's numbers show there's still a lot of strength in releasing a film exclusively to theaters. As for the theater industry, \"The Batman's\" box office is another step towards normalcy after two years of stops and starts because of the pandemic. \"The Batman\" making $128.5 million is also impressive considering that the film was both lengthy   and decidedly grim. Clocking in at two hours and 56 minutes, it's one of the longest superhero movies ever made. That extended run time makes it hard to maximize screenings, and thus tickets sales. Also, the film's violent, dark tone isn't exactly family friendly, so that likely kept some ticket buyers from bringing kids to the movie. Despite all of that, it clearly found an audience, likely helped by the stellar reviews. \"The Batman\" notched an 85% score on Rotten Tomatoes and an \"A-\" CinemaScore from audiences. CNN's Brian Lowry wrote in his review that the film is \"a dark and serious epic.\" \"'The Batman' presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired,\" he said. So what's next for the box office adventures of \"The Batman\"? Likely more money. March is wide open for the film since there's really not much competition for the rest of the month. The next potential big money-maker, Sony's \"Morbius,\" doesn't hit theaters until April 1.",

        "input": "(CNN)In a promotional video from a documentary that is of interest to the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, former President Donald Trump is heard being asked about the day of the attack on the US Capitol. The trailer does not include additional footage of the interaction with Trump beyond him saying, \"Yes.\" The trailer will be released by Discovery Plus, which is owned by CNN's parent company, and is the first video from the documentary released publicly. The interview was shot by Alex Holder, a British documentarian subpoenaed by the committee who has turned over raw footage of his interviews with Trump, members of the Trump family and former Vice President Mike Pence, according to a statement he released earlier this week. The footage is a new development in the ongoing January 6, 2021, investigation and two criminal probes related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A Discovery spokesperson confirmed to CNN's Brian Stelter that the project is owned by the company. \"Alex Holder's 'Unprecedented' three-part docuseries about the 2020 election will be released on discovery+ later this summer. Featuring never-before-seen footage of the Trump family on the campaign trail and their reactions to the outcome of the election, the docuseries will offer intimate and unprecedented interviews with Trump, his family and others who were in the White House,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. Trump and his family -- including daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, both former Trump White House senior advisers -- are speaking directly to camera in the footage. A short snippet of Ivanka Trump's interview was first reported Tuesday night. Trump and his allies have yet to react publicly to news that Holder was subpoenaed by the committee or to the revelation of what Ivanka Trump said in one of her interviews now in the panel's possession. Holder is expected to appear behind closed-doors for a deposition with the committee on Thursday where he will likely face questions about what he observed over the course of nearly six months when he had behind-the-scenes access to key Trump figures and even the former President himself. He also has longer clips, parts of which are in the documentary and parts of which were given to Congress. In addition to the footage itself, Holder also has anecdotes and stories from his time with the Trump team that have never been told and could shed new light on what was happening behind the scenes both in the lead-up to and after January 6, 2021. The committee is reviewing the footage Holder has already handed over and the panel's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, on Wednesday characterized it as \"important.\" Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, also said that the committee has delayed its hearing schedule after Thursday, in part, because it needs to examine all the footage provided by Holder, as well as other evidence the panel continues to receive. This story has been updated with additional details.",

The announcement comes as Ukrainian leaders have called for a boycott against the company, and accused Renault of \"sponsoring Russia's war machine.\" Just one day earlier, Renault had said it was resuming production for three days only. Regarding its involvement in major Russian car manufacturer AvtoVAZ, owned by Renault, the French carmaker said that it's \"assessing the available options, taking into account the current environment, while acting responsibly towards its 45,000 employees in Russia.\" The company also said it is \"already implementing the necessary measures to comply with international sanctions.\" AvtoVAZ's brand Lada represented nearly 21% of the Russian market in 2021, according to Renault Group's financial results. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called out major French companies, including Renault, by name for continuing their operations in Russia. \"Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others must stop being the sponsors of Russia's war machine,\" Zelensky said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba went further, calling for a global boycott of the carmaker. \"Renault refuses to pull out of Russia. Not that it should surprise anyone when Renault supports a brutal war of aggression in Europe,\" Kuleba said in a tweet. \"But mistakes must come with a price, especially when repeated. I call on customers and businesses around the globe to boycott Group Renault.\" Renault declined to comment when asked by CNN if the decision to suspend its activities at the Moscow factory is connected to the strong words from Ukrainian leaders. Renault said in the statement that the value of its consolidated intangible assets, property, plant, equipment, and goodwill in Russia amounted to more than $2.41 billion at the end of 2021.",

The child was placed in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, according to police. In a statement following the shooting, State Attorney for Orange and Osceola Counties Monique H. Worrell said her office has began reviewing the case and will \"consider all of the facts, including the age of the child, and all of the surrounding circumstances, when making a charging decision.\" \"We want to be clear in stating that no charging decision has been made by our office,\" the state attorney's statement said, adding the incident was \"one of the most tragic cases I have seen in my 22-year career.\" The child's mother is also in custody, according to Orlando police. Witnesses told police the shooting occurred on the night of May 30, when the child's mother and the victim, Lashun Denise Rodgers, 41, began arguing outside an apartment complex, according to an arrest report. The child was with her mother at the time of the argument, according to the arrest report, which cited witnesses. The mother allegedly initiated a physical altercation by punching Rodgers, who retaliated by punching her back, the arrest report says, citing Rodgers' boyfriend as one witness. The boyfriend told authorities he attempted to break up the fight, but the victim tried to \"re-engage\" with the mother, according to the report. He then allegedly saw the child holding a black firearm before firing \"one to two shots\" at Rodgers, an arrest report shows. The child then allegedly yelled \"she shouldn't have hit my momma,\" the boyfriend told police. Rodgers was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center where she later died, according to police spokesperson Heidi Rodriguez. The girl's mother was taken into custody and the child was placed in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, police said. CNN has reached out to the attorney for the child's mother, but has not received a response. CNN has not been able to obtain attorney information for the child involved. Police said the investigation is ongoing.",

From 1964 to the present day, the country has registered more than 100,023 people missing, of which more than 24,700 are women, and more than 74,700 are men. The gender of 516 people is unknown. The figure has risen by more than 20,000 people in the past two years alone, according to the data, which was met with outrage and urgent calls for better systems for search and rescue. Only 35 of the disappearances recorded have led to the conviction of the perpetrators, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement Tuesday. \"No effort should be spared to put an end to these human rights violations and abuses of extraordinary breadth, and to vindicate victims' rights to truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-repetition,\" said Bachelet. Marlene Harbig of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) discussed the trauma suffered by families with missing persons. \"The first few hours are the most important, when someone disappears, their relatives have the right to know what has happened,\" said Harbig in a news release. \"Knowing the fate of disappeared persons is primarily a humanitarian act.\" Despite the numbers, Bachelet highlighted progress made by the Mexican government, recognizing Mexico as the first country to allow a visit by the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances to work with authorities in 13 Mexican states. Both the ICRC and the UN have called for family members to be allowed to work with government authorities in working to find their loved ones. According to a statement to the media, Michele Bachelet requested the government \"to place the families of those who have disappeared at the center of their efforts, and to make the necessary resources available for investigations and searches to be effective.\"",

        "input": "New York (CNN Business)The House Oversight Committee launched a probe Monday into Credit Suisse, demanding documents linked to the bank's compliance with sanctions on Russian oligarchs. In a letter to Credit Suisse CEO Thomas Gottstein, US lawmakers asked the bank to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients, potentially including sanctioned Russian individuals. In particular, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Stephen Lynch, chair of the Subcommittee on National Security, expressed alarm over Credit Suisse asking hedge funds and other investors to \"destroy documents\" related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank's clients. \"Giving the timing of this request and its subject matter,\" the House Democrats wrote, \"Credit Suisse's action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information\" about whether participants in the deal may be \"evading sanctions\" imposed by the West after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, asks Credit Suisse to produce a series of documents by April 11. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the letter, referring inquiries to previous statements from the bank. The focus on Credit Suisse began after a recent Financial Times report, which said the bank had trimmed some of its exposure to $2 billion of loans made to wealthy clients to finance private planes and yachts. The FT later reported Credit Suisse asked investors to destroy deal documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans. Credit Suisse confirmed in a March 3 statement that it did ask non-participating investors in a November 2021 transaction to \"destroy documents,\" but that this was \"in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions, with which we are fully compliant.\" The bank said the documents shared with investors did not contain any client names and/or asset identifiers and \"no data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse.\" \"Reminding parties to destroy confidential information is good housekeeping and good data hygiene,\" Credit Suisse said in the statement. \"The transaction and the request to non-participating investors to destroy confidential data are entirely unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.\"",

In a memo arguing that the two men should remain detained pending trial, prosecutors wrote that Arian Taherzadeh and Haider Ali compromised federal law enforcement operations and created a potential risk to national security. \"The Defendants were not merely playing dress-up,\" prosecutors wrote in the memo filed on Friday. \"They had firearms, they had ammunition, they had body armor, they had tactical gear, they had surveillance equipment.\" Taherzadeh and Ali were arrested earlier this week and charged with impersonating Department of Homeland Security agents for more than two years. They gave expensive gifts to federal agents and provided them apartments in Washington, DC, according to the detention memo. Taherzadeh allegedly offered to purchase a $2,000 assault rifle for a Secret Service agent on the first lady's protective detail, according to an affidavit. Prosecutors have not provided an alleged motive or the purpose of the fake operation, nor have authorities identified a source of the money that funded it. The two men will appear at a detention hearing Friday, and prosecutors have indicated in court that they may add additional charges for \"conspiracy.\" \"Neither Defendant is even employed by the United States government. But their impersonation scheme was sufficiently realistic to convince other government employees, including law enforcement agents, of their false identities,\" prosecutors wrote. \"They pretended to recruit other individuals to law enforcement and their fake operation... and leveraged their phony law enforcement status to ingratiate themselves to other law enforcement agents in sensitive positions.\" After their arrest, prosecutors say Taherzadeh told investigators that Ali funded most of their day-to-day operation but Taherzadeh said he did not know where the money came from. The pair were also in possession of \"immigration documents for a number of individuals,\" according to the memo from prosecutors, and had significant access to information about other tenants in the Washington, DC, apartment complex where they and a number of law enforcement officials resided, including the electronic access codes and a list of each tenant. In addition, prosecutors said the pair had a machine to make \"Personal Identification Verification\" cards as well as passport photographs. Witnesses saw Taherzadeh with a PIV card he used to log in to his laptop that had a \"DHS\" label on it, according to the memo. Taherzadeh had multiple copies of his driver's license and various ID cards, and Ali had traveled to Iran and had two visas from Pakistan and one for travel to Egypt. According to the memo, Taherzadeh and Ali were stockpiling weapons and law enforcement equipment in multiple apartments they leased in a DC apartment complex. In one apartment, which investigators said was used for storage, investigators found a loaded Glock 19 handgun and a Sig Sauer handgun, parts to a long gun, scopes, and multiple rounds of ammunition. In other apartments, investigators discovered surveillance equipment, including 30 hard drives, hard drive copying equipment and a \"high-end drone,\" as well as clothing with police insignia, police parking placards, a latent fingerprint kit and a lock picking kit, according to the detention memo. Taherzadeh pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and battery of his wife in Virginia court in 2013, prosecutors noted, and is prohibited from owning firearms.
