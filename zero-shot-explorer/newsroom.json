        "article": "Sitting in the third-floor lounge of a hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Masanori “Mashi” Murakami leaned forward in his chair and hummed the melody to the Sukiyaki song.  He was relaxed. Not like 51 years ago, on September 1 1964, when he began humming the famous Kyu Sakamoto song as he came out of the Shea Stadium bullpen in the eighth inning, with nearly 40,000 fans watching.  “I go to the fence and the door opens, and I go in,” Murakami recalled. “I’m walking to the mound, that time, wow. But [being] inside [the field] is very different. Maybe if I get nervous, it’s not good. Now, I think OK, make me relax. The stands, the people. I can hear, but I don’t know what they’re saying. I understood a little English.”  Mashi began to ease up as he hummed the Sukiyaki song to himself on his way to the mound, then pitched an inning of relief and struck out two batters.  What 20-year-old Mashi didn’t realize then was the gravity of the situation, as he had just became the first Japanese player in Major League Baseball history.  Mashi pitched to a 5-1 record with a 3.43 earned-run average and 100 strikeouts in 54 games with the Giants over parts of the 1964 and 1965 seasons before returning to Japan to honor his contract with the Nankai Hawks.  On Monday, Mashi, 71, visited Fenway Park to share his story at an event hosted by the Japan Society of Boston, alongside Robert Fitts, author of the biography, Mashi: The Unfulfilled Baseball Dreams of Masanori Murakami, the First Japanese Major Leaguer, and Yuriko Gamo Romer, director of the documentary Diamond Diplomacy.  “I was never thinking of the major leagues,” Mashi said before the event. “I just wanted to pitch.”  Mashi surprisingly pitched with great success, but his only regret is that he didn’t pitch longer in the United States.  The start of his 1965 season was delayed, as the Giants and the Hawks worked over a contract dispute. Mashi was ultimately allowed to play with the Giants, only if he honored the promise he would return to the Hawks after the season.  Once he did, another Japanese player did not play in the MLB for 30 years until Hideo Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995.  As Fitts writes in his book: “The dispute over Murakami’s contract would ignite an international incident that ultimately prevented other Japanese players from joining the Majors for 30 years.”  But for the short time he pitched in the Majors, Mashi was making a profound impact, even if he didn’t know it yet.  “I wasn’t thinking about all of that other stuff. And I was stupid,” Mashi joked.  “When I went to the mound, I was never scared. I didn’t think about who was coming up at bat. Who is Hank Aaron? Who is Pete Rose? Who is [Roberto] Clemente? I didn’t know. I didn’t care. I pitched my same style as in the minor leagues.”  After Mashi signed as a 19-year-old with the Nankai Hawks of the Japanese Pacific League, they sent him to the United States to hone his skills.  He arrived at Giants spring training with an English dictionary in one hand and a Japanese dictionary in the other, the only way he could communicate with new teammates like Willie Mays, Gaylord Perry and Juan Marichal.  “It was good for me because I learned fast,” Mashi said. “With an interpreter, [you learn] nothing.”  Mashi began the season in Fresno, where he pitched to an 11-7 record in 106 innings, with 159 strikeouts and a 1.78 ERA.  He played his last game in Fresno August 29, before Fresno manager Bill Werle told him he was promoted to the San Francisco Giants.  The Giants sent him to New York with a one-way ticket, a daunting trip for somebody in a foreign land.  After he arrived at JFK airport, Mashi went to the Roosevelt hotel and headed to the concierge desk to check in, only to find out his name wasn’t on file. Mashi asked the concierge to check again, but still there was no name.  He grabbed his bags and sat in the corner, wondering if he would ever join his San Francisco Giants teammates.  “I’m thinking: if nobody comes, what do I do?” Mashi said. “Maybe tomorrow morning somebody might find me in the Hudson river.”  Of course, the Giants eventually came for Mashi. When he got to Shea Stadium and practiced before his debut, Giants GM Chub Feeney had Mashi sign a contract – although he couldn’t understand what exactly was written on it.  What he did understand is that if he didn’t sign it, he couldn’t play.  There’s a watershed moment of sorts for Mashi and his impact on the Japanese American culture when he played in the United States. During a game against the Dodgers, Mashi tried voicing his displeasure with the home plate umpire after a call he didn’t agree with.  The only problem was Mashi couldn’t argue because he didn’t understand enough English. Instead, he angrily tossed the Rosin bag in the air before he threw his next pitch.  Later in San Francisco, a man came up to Mashi in a restaurant and thanked him after watching the game on television.  “He said by doing that one little action, in some ways for this generation of Japanese Americans, it relieved many years of upset and oppression,” Mashi explained with the help of Gamo, who translated.  “I don’t know name, but he was emboldened by this action.”  Even then, Mashi didn’t fully understand the impact he was having.  As he sat at the hotel Monday, Mashi reflected on his career and the passageway he opened for future Japanese major leaguers, even if it was cut short.  “He has some understanding [now] that there was a purpose, that it had some impact,” Mashi explained via Gamo’s translation. “But he has some concern it caused some trouble.”  “Every player that can come over here and play baseball, I think is very good,” Mashi said. “Each man only has one time at life…to reach the [highest level] of baseball.”",

        "article": "A week after the death of Fidel Castro, the jubilant mood among Cuban exiles in Miami’s Little Havana neighbourhood is slowly giving way to one of measured contemplation, along with some apprehension about what will happen to their homeland when Donald Trump becomes US president in January.  News of Castro’s demise sparked a giant street party along Calle Ocho that by Wednesday night had morphed into a rally attended by hundreds at the Bay of Pigs monument, demanding a restoration of human rights and political reforms in Cuba.  The shifting emotions reflect what community leaders say is a renewed hope for change on the island among Miami’s almost one million Cuban Americans – the majority of whom left the country because of their opposition to Castro’s regime –sparked by Castro’s death and Trump’s election in the same month.  “Fidel Castro was more than just a symbol. His physical disappearance will be far-reaching, past the celebratory atmosphere in south Florida and of so many who see his death as a burial of the worst of Cuba,” said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation.  “It will unleash the shackles from those within the regime of a different generation who want change, who want to project Cuba to be part of a group of nations that function. I’m hopeful that the Cuban exile community sees our role as helping Cubans on the island, to empower them and be the architects of change for Cuba.”  Trump followed a well-trodden path as he courted the votes of Miami’s Cuban Americans this year, with a photo-op with a cafecito and pastelitos at Calle Ocho’s famous Versailles Bakery and a platform at the Bay of Pigs museum in Little Havana upon which to deliver a fiery denunciation of Barack Obama for thawing relations with the Cuban president, Raúl Castro, who formally succeeded his brother as leader in 2008.  “If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal,” Trump tweeted two days after Fidel Castro’s death. But with other priorities now consuming the attention of Trump’s transition team, Cubans in south Florida wonder if the president-elect really intends to deliver on the pledges he has made to rein in Obama’s new accord.  Guillermo Grenier, professor of sociology at Florida International University’s Cuban Research Institute, is sceptical. “When Trump began to see that the Cuban vote might be significant in Florida, he did what every other politician since 1959 has done, come to the Cuban community and said, ‘Next year we’re going to do something about the Castro government, next year we’re going to be hardline,” he said. “There’s no strong consensus Trump knows what to do about Cuba. There’s no compelling reason to mess around with Cuba and I don’t think Trump will do anything about Cuba.”  Trump has yet to appoint a secretary of state who will help steer the direction of the new era in Washington-Havana relations, and aside from appointing Mauricio Claver-Carone, executive director of a political action committee opposed to Cuban engagement, to his transition team for the treasury department, the president-elect has offered few clues.  And there is a generational divide among Cuban Americans on the rapprochement with their former homeland, Grenier said. “Younger Cubans, the new arrivals, the second-generation Cubans born in the US that voted for Trump, almost all are for engagement. You still have that older generation, a smaller part of the community today but nevertheless wealthier and more politically connected and influential, the same old guard saying we should have a reeling back … The ones who have the megaphone are the ones that are going to be heard.”  Nevertheless, Trump’s hard line seemed to resonate with many of Florida’s 1.2 million Cuban Americans in last month’s presidential election, with 54% voting for him, according to Pew Research, up from the 47% who backed Mitt Romney in 2012.  Among them was Juan Fiol, a Miami-based realtor who was born in the US to Cuban immigrant parents, who believes the majority of his community backed Trump because they thought he would stand up to Raúl Castro.  “That’s the reason we vote heavily for the Republicans, not Democrats,” he said. “Cubans know what a socialist is. The Democratic party is a socialist party; they have the same thinking and style.”  Mas was optimistic about future relations between the US and Cuba. “Some of the elements of what Obama did will continue under President Trump, there will be renewed emphasis on human rights and a potential renegotiation based on the experience of the last two years, which has seen little to no investment from US companies in Cuba,” he said.  “Cuba has to move, it has to make reforms, it has to do things to entice investment and free enterprise. [But] the death of Fidel Castro has lifted a dark veil. People here have hope and expectation for a better future. Now the work begins.”",

        "article": "\"We weren't expecting the rapid growth. We opened our first location in 2012 and less than six months later, due to the great response from the people, we opened our second location,\" said Eladio Montoya, 35.  He and his wife, Judith, 33, became entrepreneurs when they conquered their fears three years ago and opened the doors of Los Mangos with $5,000 in savings. Today, they own seven locations across the Chicago metropolitan area and employ more than 50 people, with an eighth store on the way.  \"It was very scary,\" Judith said about expanding to a second and then third location. Eladio finished her sentence with a smile and said, \"We decided to take that challenge and it worked out.\"  But now they face another fear: what Donald Trump's rhetoric about ending birthright citizenship means for them and their extended family and friends, who include people who were born in America to undocumented immigrants.  They are particularly troubled by his intimations that he would revoke the citizenship of those who have already received it.  Donald Trump: Birthright babies not citizens  Trump said last week that he doesn't think people born in the United States to undocumented immigrants are citizens.  \"I don't think they have American citizenship, and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers -- and I know some will disagree, but many of them agree with me -- and you're going to find they do not have American citizenship. We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell,\" the Republican presidential front-runner told Fox News on Tuesday night. Trump said he would \"test it out\" in the courts.  Trump has called for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants living in the United States, about 11 million people, and then allowing the \"good ones\" to return through an expedited legal process.  On Wednesday morning, he was questioned by CNN's \"New Day\" co-host Chris Cuomo about his call to end birthright citizenship as granted under the 14th Amendment, which states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside.\"  \"The 14th Amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over, have a baby and immediately that baby is a citizen,\" Trump told Cuomo.  Trump didn't answer Cuomo's question about the retroactive application of his proposed policy, which if carried out, would mean Judith's two brothers, who were born to undocumented parents, could be stripped of their citizenship.  Judith said she doesn't feel safe, either, even though by the time she was born, her parents had obtained legal residency through a granting of amnesty in the 1980s.  Eladio and his family obtained legal residency in the 1980s through the amnesty, too, but he also thinks he could be affected if Trump's policy was imposed retroactively.  Eladio said he was 6 years old when his mother crossed him and three of his siblings illegally from Mexico's northern state of Sonora into Arizona. He was the youngest of the group, but remembers the details of the voyage very well.  \"We crossed a fence that was broken. The person who was taking us, he guided us to the entrance and we just crossed,\" said Eladio, who remembers his mom maintaining a tight grip on his hand, because \"she was scared.\"  \"We had nothing in Mexico,\" recalled Eladio, explaining that they had left for better opportunity. \"We lived on a small ranch. There were 11 houses in that ranch.\"  He said he and his family boarded a plane to Chicago shortly after crossing the broken fence and arrived in the city's Little Village, a neighborhood that today is predominantly Latino.  Eladio wondered how Trump's suggestion of allowing the \"good ones\" back after deportation would work.  \"I consider myself good,\" said Eladio, but he pointed out that no one really knows what constitutes a \"good\" immigrant.  \"Where does it stop?\" Judith asked. \"He said he's not going to separate families, that he's just going to send them back together, but where does it stop?\"  Trump's focus on immigration is forcing his Republican competitors to take a stand.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have sided with Trump on the issue of birthright citizenship, though they acknowledge that changing it would be difficult.  Still, they and other detractors argue that the country must enforce immigration laws and not unfairly reward those who break them by granting citizenship to their children -- and then potentially to the undocumented immigrants themselves who can then claim status through their children.  In addition, they contend that the birthright citizenship clause, an outlier in the developed world, encourages more people to take the risk of entering the United States without permission in order to secure citizenship for their children.  Not all Republicans want to rescind the practice. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush oppose the repeal of the 14th Amendment.  But for the present time, Trump is gaining momentum and continues to lead the Republican race. Should his immigration policy come to pass, it could be life-changing for the Montoyas and their extended family.  \"Our life is here. Our homes are here,\" Judith said.  \"What is going to happen to our business? What's going to happen with our kids? What's going to happen to our employees?\" Eladio asked, contemplating the prospect of losing his citizenship. \"I would be forced to shut down our business that's creating jobs and feeding families.\"  But the Montoyas say they are willing to put Trump's comments about Mexicans being \"rapists\" and \"killers\" aside and invite the real estate mogul to any one of their Los Mangos locations, where everyone, they say, is welcomed with a smile.  \"I want him to come here to my business and see that we are not criminals. We didn't come here to rob anybody,\" Eladio said. \"We are not taking anybody's job.\"  If Trump were to come, Eladio has a message for him: \"We are making America great.\"",

        "article": "DENVER  A Utah couple and a woman who wants to become the second wife in their family are asking a Denver-based federal appeals court to overturn Utah's ban on polygamy, saying it violates their rights to religion, association and privacy.  A Salt Lake County clerk refused to issue a marriage license in December 2003 when G. Lee Cook and the second woman — accompanied by Cook's wife — applied. About a year later, a federal judge dismissed their lawsuit, saying the clerk properly followed state laws and rejecting arguments that those laws violate the rights of people who believe in plural marriage.  On Monday, a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals formally accepted written arguments submitted earlier this year. There was no indication when they might rule.  The case is being watched by adherents of plural marriage, who hope it will be eventually taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court, which last considered the issue in 1878, said Mary Batchelor of Sandy, Utah, executive director of the group Principle Voices.  \"It's time for it to be readdressed,\" she said in an interview. \"We live in a society of family arrangements that simply are, no matter how people want to define them. They are not labeled criminal and we don't believe our family arrangements should be labeled criminal either.\"  Attorney Brian Barnard, who represents the Cooks and the other woman, identified only as J. Bronson, wrote that Utah's ban on polygamy is unconstitutional despite numerous court rulings, including an 1878 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the polygamy conviction of George Reynolds, personal secretary to Mormon leader Brigham Young.  \"The sincere and deeply held religious beliefs of J. Bronson, D. Cook and G. Lee Cook are that the doctrine of plural marriage, i.e., a man having more than one wife, is ordained of God and is to be encouraged and practiced,\" Barnard wrote.  He argued that the state's ban unconstitutionally targets one religion, and that under a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking Texas laws banning sodomy, polygamy is a private interest that should not be prosecuted.  \"The [Supreme Court] found no compelling state interest in criminalizing homosexual sodomy based on a long history of states and/or a majority of society finding the practice immoral. Similarly, the state of Utah can offer no compelling justification for criminalizing polygamy,\" Barnard wrote.  \"Utah's criminalization of religious polygamy, even if the crime is rarely prosecuted, brands plaintiffs as criminals and sanctions public and private discrimination based on plaintiffs' religious based choice of marital relationship,\" he wrote.  In her brief, Assistant Utah Attorney General Nancy Kemp said the state's anti-bigamy law affects all residents, not just members of fundamentalist Mormon sects who continue to hold those beliefs despite a decision by the mainstream Church of Latter-day Saints to abandon the practice more than 100 years ago.  \"Nothing in the statute suggests that it is to be applied only in the context of religiously motivated plural marriage, and, in fact, it has been applied outside the context of religion,\" Kemp wrote.  Polygamy has been practiced in Utah since the 1800s, when early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settled the Salt Lake valley. The faith officially abandoned the practice in 1890, although it continued among members who splintered away from the main church.",

        "article": "The Federal Reserve left its interest rates unchanged this afternoon, betting once again that inflation will remain contained as the economy cools.  After a two-year march of uninterrupted increases, the Fed has now held rates steady for two months running. As the economy heads into a period of what is expected to be much slower growth, the Federal Reserves chief policy goal under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will be to engineer a soft landing  without run-ups in either inflation or unemployment.  In a statement this afternoon explaining its decision to keep overnight lending rates at 5.25 percent, the Feds polity-setting committee pointed to the slowing economy. The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market, the committee said.  Most economists expected todays decision; many believe the Fed will leave its benchmark short-term rates as they are through the end of the year or longer. And a growing number now predict that when it comes, the Feds next rate change will be downward, not upward, as the threat of inflation subsides.  Investors expected the decision as well, and the stock market barely moved after the Feds decision was announced at 2:15 p.m.  In the last week, a number of statistical reports have borne out the Feds outlook on the economy. Consumer prices rose less in August than in the previous four months, producer prices rose only modestly, and the housing market is continuing to cool.  If those trends continue, the Feds attention will shift before long from keeping a lid on inflation to preventing too much slackening in the economy, particularly in the job market  and begin to consider rate decreases.  The economy grew at just a 2.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, compared with a 5.6 percent rate in the first. Forecasters say the figure for the third quarter will be smaller still, and with new evidence appearing each week that the housing market is slowing more rapidly than expected, they have lately been revising their forecasts downward.  When economic growth slows, job growth is likely to follow.  What happens to the labor market will probably be of the utmost concern to the Fed, said John Lonski, chief economist with Moodys Investors Service. Its more likely well have the unemployment rate move up to 5 percent rather than move down. The weight of the evidence favors a further slackening of the U.S. economy, including the labor market.  In its statement today, the Fed once again left itself room to raise rates should inflation again be a cause for concern. It is not certain whether prices have stopped their steep climb of the past few months. In fact, there are signals that inflation could again tick back up. In particular, unit labor costs, which have played a large role in past inflationary spikes, are rising rapidly.  These concerns were apparently strong enough to keep one member of the Feds policy-setting committee from voting to keep rates stable. Jeffrey M. Lacker voted today in favor of a quarter-point increase in rates. Mr. Lacker also voted to raise rates last month.  The statement from the committee at large repeated verbatim the comments from last month that the threat from inflation has not yet entirely disappeared. Some inflation risks remain, the statement said. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.  One factor that the Fed does not think will play a large role going forward is energy prices. In months past, the Fed has noted that soaring energy costs were pushing inflation upwards. But in a shift, the statement today said the Fed expects a reduced impetus from energy prices. That, along with the continuing effects of past interest rate increases, will help hold prices down, the Fed said.  Though the Feds statement was largely identical to the one issued last month, some economists said that small changes in the language bespoke a waning concern over inflation. Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics, called the statement more dovish than the last.They want to leave their options open, just in case, he said, but the reality is they are done hiking.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON — Congressional negotiators introduced a sweeping year-end spending and tax-break package early Wednesday that busts through previously agreed budget limits with $66 billion in new spending for 2016 and that makes permanent an array of tax benefits at a cost of adding more than a half-trillion dollars to the deficit.  The $1.1 trillion spending measure includes a provision to end the 40-year ban on exports of crude oil from the United States — a major priority of Republicans — and also provides a large increase in funds for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. It also reauthorizes and expands federal aid for emergency workers suffering from health ailments related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York City.  After weeks of tense negotiations, congressional Democrats and the White House succeeded in beating back policy amendments that Republicans had sought to attach to the spending measure. Those included efforts to scuttle an environmental rule expanding federal oversight over domestic waterways, new conflict of interest rules for financial advisers and a labor provision that would have made it more difficult for employees of fast-food restaurants to join unions.  The spending bill also includes new restrictions to the visa-waiver program, a fast-track process used by millions of visitors to enter the United States, that lawmakers pursued because of concern after the recent terrorist attacks carried out by the Islamic State. The bill also incorporates a measure that expands the sharing of information between private firms and federal security agencies to prevent cyberattacks.  The spending measure notably does not include tighter restrictions on admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees that had been approved overwhelmingly in a separate measure in the House; the Obama administration and Senate Democrats said they would block it if added.  The tax portion also delays some important provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive private health insurance plans.  While Republican leaders in Congress characterized the year-end package as representing a hard-fought compromise that would keep the government open and provide large-scale investment and tax breaks, it poses a challenge for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who had promised a more open and inclusive legislative process.  Republicans posted the spending measure, which contains 2,009 pages, at 1:34 a.m., missing a midnight deadline. That forced Mr. Ryan to delay a vote on the proposal that he had initially planned for Thursday.  Some conservatives immediately complained that they were once again rushed into making a decision on major legislation. The 233-page tax measure was released just before midnight, and House leaders said a Thursday vote on that portion would proceed as planned. Still, Mr. Ryan was left effectively apologizing, and described himself as equally annoyed by the way the process had played out.  “Let me be the first to say, I don’t think this is the way government should work,” Mr. Ryan said at a news conference Wednesday morning at the Capitol. “This is not how appropriations should work.”  The House is expected to vote on the spending bill on Friday, then go to the Senate where the two measures may be combined into a single piece of legislation.  While the overall deal is expected to be approved, shepherding the package into law will not be easy.  The votes of House Democrats are almost certainly needed to pass the spending measure, but many of them oppose the tax package. Many Republicans support the tax cuts, but some conservatives object to the additional deficit spending.  The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, of California, voiced outrage on Wednesday over the tax-break bill, which she said would unfairly benefit big business over the middle-class and working-poor Americans. At a brief news conference, she called it “practically an immorality.”  In the Senate, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, urged his colleagues to read the legislation and prepare for debate.  The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said, “This was not an easy process,” but noted, “no legislation is perfect. This is good legislation that is truly the art of compromise.”  At the White House on Wednesday, the press secretary, Josh Earnest, praised the result, suggesting that Mr. Obama would sign the package into law. Mr. Earnest happily listed the many riders championed by Republicans that he had been asked about repeatedly in recent weeks that were not in the final legislation, including provisions to curtail the Dodd-Frank financial industry regulation law and an effort to cut off financing for Planned Parenthood.  “We feel good about the outcome,” Mr. Earnest said, adding: “The president would be pleased to sign the bill.”  To get to that point, however, Congress will need to extend a stopgap spending measure that has kept the government functioning since Friday, when lawmakers missed an initial deadline to complete the spending package. Congressional leaders said they would keep the stopgap in place until Tuesday.  Mr. Ryan said he hoped to begin the regular appropriations process early next year, offering enough time to debate the bills. A budget agreement reached in October with Democrats and the White House may make that easier, but the current negotiations showed that even with overall spending limits set, Democrats and Republicans have such fundamentally different views that it is difficult to find consensus on anything but the most basic priorities of government.  Mr. Ryan also noted that he had become speaker at a point when negotiations over the omnibus spending bill had already begun between Democrats and his predecessor, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio.  “We played the cards that we were dealt with as best as we possibly could,” Mr. Ryan said. “I believe we’ve made the best of it.”  For weeks, negotiations focused on the policy changes, or so-called riders that lawmakers in both parties — especially Republicans seeking to thwart the Obama administration — had hoped to attach to the spending measure.  Democrats, for their part, had hoped for a rider that would have ended a ban on federal financing for medical research into gun violence. No riders related to gun control are in the bill.  One area of notable compromise was the increase in financing for the National Institutes of Health, by $2 billion.  Health advocates applauded the increase for N.I.H., which saw funding decline several years ago under budget cuts commonly referred to as the sequester. Researchers complained that the cuts delayed grants and made it more difficult to do government-funded scientific work in the United States.  “This is huge,” said Christopher W. Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, an advocacy group. He said the increase restored the cuts that were part of the budget controls, and increased N.I.H. funding by an additional 4 percent. “We’re going to have a lot of people who will survive because of this.”  Robert Pear, Jennifer Steinhauer, Sabrina Tavernise and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting from Washington.

        "article": "Timothy Egan on American politics and life, as seen from the West. You must remember this: “He worked as a community organizer.”  Timothy Egan on American politics and life, as seen from the West.  Rudolph Giuliani paused to choke on the words in his speech at the 2008 Republican convention, followed by a gasp, waves of laughter and more ridicule.  It became a punch line, the part of Barack Obama’s résumé that had him working with Roman Catholic parishes on Chicago’s South Side to help the unemployed. The kicker was delivered by Sarah Palin when she touted her own credentials. “I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer except that you have actual responsibilities.”  On paper, the war hero with decades of political experience is far more qualified to make life-and-death decisions than a candidate yet to be scuffed by conflict. “You’re hiring someone to do a job,” said Giuliani, in framing the choice that year, “a job that has to do with the safety of your family.”  Turns out, having a community organizer in the White House Situation Room was not a bad thing. Perhaps better than a senator who was afraid to offend an ally. And surely better than a governor who couldn’t even finish her one job with actual responsibilities. Among other things, the most critical 40 minutes of the Obama presidency prove a point backed by history: judgment and temperament are far more important than a résumé.  Harry S. Truman was ridiculed as a haberdasher — a wonderful old word that fell out of use as men’s clothiers gave way to big-box retailers. He was also the only 20th-century American president without a college degree.  Yet Truman finished the war against Nazi Germany and imperial Japan and oversaw plans that got Europe back on its feet. He racially integrated the armed forces by executive order. History has been kind to him. And, by the way, he was a failed haberdasher at that; his store went bankrupt.  Ronald Reagan, that B-list actor — what could he know about running the most powerful nation in the world? Instinctively, he knew enough to make peace with a cold war adversary at the right moment rather than push him into a nuclear corner.  It was the most seasoned of Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who initially raised doubts about whether Americans could count on an untested Barack Obama to answer the dreaded 3 a.m. phone call.  And this theme continued in the general election when Senator John McCain pummeled Obama for saying he would go into Pakistan to take out Osama bin Laden, diplomatic formalities be damned. “Will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate who once suggested bombing our ally, Pakistan?” asked McCain.  To their credit, both Giuliani and McCain have since been gracious in commending Obama on his order to get the world’s most wanted mass killer. Giuliani even toured ground zero with the president on Thursday, looking mighty pleased to be with the former community organizer in his moment of triumph.  Other Republicans — not so good. Newt Gingrich, just to pick a paragon of bad judgment out of the hat, is a college term paper on how a résumé does not make a leader. Gingrich, who is officially, formally, finally, and forever announcing that he is sort of, kind of, maybe, oh-what-hell-why-not running for president on Wednesday, had an interesting take on the airstrikes in Libya.  First, he criticized President Obama for not imposing a no-fly zone. Then he hit him for imposing a no-fly zone. In two weeks’ time, he went from saying he would intervene “this evening” to saying, “I would not have intervened.”  Just before the worst oil spill in history, he started a campaign to unfetter the oil industry, with the slogan, “Drill here, drill now.”  For historical perspective, Gingrich said President Obama and the Democrats pose “as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.” This was in one of his books, a product of deliberative phrasing, not some word spasm for the birther set. Imagine that temperament in the Situation Room.  There’s no telling, really, if Obama’s time trying to help people with rental leases and job applications did him any good in the hunt for Bin Laden. As president, he has shown himself to be a thoughtful ditherer, someone who encourages opposing views, even when others are clamoring for him to Do Something Now! In this case, it was nine months of containing the biggest secret in the world that ended with one of “the longest 40 minutes of my life,” an operation he thought had only a 55 percent chance of succeeding.  But the man who walked out of the Situation Room with the words “We got him” showed that he had learned, somewhere, that patience can pay off. No doubt, those many thankless days with the South Side poor were instructive.  This column appeared in print on May 10, 2011.",

        "article": "When Yousef was knocked down by what he describes as a powerful explosion in the small Syrian town he calls home, the injury was bad. His back was torn open, he was bleeding.  But three years of brutal civil war meant Yousef’s options for medical treatment were dire, at best. There were no doctors or nurses in the village to help. He couldn’t be taken to a hospital in a larger centre, because he’s on the wrong side of the conflict.  So, members of the Free Syrian Army got in touch with the enemy. Not Syrian forces, the other enemy: Israel.  They arranged his transfer over the long-contested border in the Golan Heights, and Yousef was brought to the Ziv Hospital in the northern Israeli community of Safad. (Every Syrian patient I spoke to at the hospital requested the use of their first names only, out of fear of attack upon their return to Syria.)  Dr. Amer Hussein (left), head of Emergency Medicine at Ziv Hospital, is an Israeli-Arab who speaks Arabic. He says some of his Syrian patients are shocked to find someone who speaks their language offering them treatment in Israel. (Derek Stoffel/CBC)  ​Yousef arrived in Israel suffering not only from severe injuries to his back, but also a life-threatening stomach infection contracted while he was offered stabilizing medical treatment in Syria. His condition was grave.  But more than two weeks later, his prognosis has improved.  Yousef occupies one of the two beds reserved for Syrians in the Intensive Care Unit at Ziv Hospital. When I first arrived, he was sleeping. Medical monitors beeped as he slumbered.  When he woke up, I asked Yousef if he knew where he was.  “No,” he told me, groggy from the pain medication he’s on. He denied knowing he was in Israel three times.  Syria and Israel have officially been at war since 1948. Syrians are surrounded by state propaganda, taught to hate Israel and blame the Jewish state for all that is wrong in their country.  But Israel has quietly offered state-of-the-art medical treatment to more than 700 Syrians in the past 13 months, at a cost of about $20 million, according to documents obtained by the Jerusalem Post. Several Syrian babies have also been delivered in Israel.  Israel and Syria are officially at war, and the rooms at Ziv Hospital where most of the Syrian patients are treated are guarded by members of the IDF (right), Israel's army. (Derek Stoffel/CBC)  Most of the patients are believed to have been civilians, though Ziv Hospital staff say many of the men treated are rebel fighters. When I ask Yousef if he’s with the Free Syrian Army, he denies it, but one nurse says he has privately confided this fact to hospital staff.  Two hundred and forty one Syrians have been treated at Ziv Hospital. Others have been taken to medical centres in various northern communities, while the Israel Defence Forces have operated a field hospital offering medical care to Syrians, though it’s believed that facility is currently closed.  “I think this is [a] bridge for peace,” said Dr. Amer Hussein, the chief of emergency medicine at Ziv Hospital.  Dr. Hussein is an Israeli-Arab who speaks Arabic. He admits that some of his Syrian patients are shocked to find someone who speaks their language offering them treatment in Israel.  “At the beginning [the patients] were very surprised and stressed. But now they heard about this and they don’t stress.”  Nasser, another patient, was brought to Ziv Hospital last September after being involved in a car accident near the Syrian city of Dera’a, not too far from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. His situation was similar to Yousef’s: no medical staff nearby and he was unable to seek treatment in the local hospital, which is controlled by the Syrian regime.  So Nasser was brought to Israel, where he’s had several operations to treat a severe injury to his left leg.  “If I were to have stayed in Syria, I would have died. Or the war would have killed me. I came here, taking a risk, but in Israel there’s a chance to get treatment. And thank God that’s what happened,” he said from his hospital bed.  Nasser’s road to recovery remains long, but he does worry about going home. He’s heard the stories of Syrians who have been attacked for seeking treatment in Israel. Yet, he does want to go back to his village.  Foad Hanna (right), the head nurse at Ziv Hospital’s ICU, says it's difficult to say goodbye to Syrian patients he has treated, knowing the conditions in the war zone they're returning to. (Derek Stoffel/CBC)  “I want to see my family. I want to see my friends. And I want to be on my land.”  There are some who think Israel has an obligation to protect those Syrians who do not want to return, while the civil war continues unabated. More than 140,000 Syrians have died in nearly three years of fighting.  The organization Physicians for Human Rights - Israel has recently taken up the cause of those Syrians receiving treatment in Israel.  The group’s director of public outreach, Hadas Ziv, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that a system should be developed “that would ensure every injured Syrian receive a meeting with a representative of the Red Cross or the UN refugee agency, and that each and every patient be informed of the possibility of remaining in Israel as an asylum seeker.”  Foad Hanna, the head nurse at Ziv Hospital’s ICU, says the patients treated in Israel should, at least, be given more options. “When I say goodbye to people, I always think of the war zone they’re going back to. And that is hard for me.”  Yousef tells me he wants to go back to Syria when he is well enough. “I have a family to take care of.”  Years of being taught that Israel is the enemy may have made it hard for him to acknowledge where he is being treated, but when I ask him about the doctors and nurses at Ziv Hospital, he manages a small smile.  “I am getting the best medical treatment here. [To the medical staff] I say thank you and God will reward you for helping me.”",

I've been to a bunch of weddings and family events this year and I took hundreds of photos at each of them. It takes me forever to find my favorites now. Help!  A. You need a photo organizing program that helps you group and tag photos so you can find specific events and people in seconds. It will also help you with basic editing like cropping, rotating and red-eye removal, and help you upload your favorites to Facebook or other social media. For PC, Google's free Picasa is a solid option and Mac users, of course, have the excellent iPhoto installed by default. Click here to learn more about using these programs and tricks for organizing your photos so you always have the ones you want at your fingertips.  Simple step for big savings  Q. I'm trying to cut down on how much I'm spending every month and I've heard you can get grocery coupons online, but I don't know where. Can you help?  A. There are several sites that offer printable grocery coupons and coupons for non-grocery stores as well. Coupons.com, for example, covers more than 52,000 stores, and can help you find deals near you. Valpak is a name you're probably familiar with from your mailbox and it has digital coupons as well. Click here for even more coupon sites, along with apps that mean you don't have to print out coupons to use them in the store.  Signs of a dying computer  Q. My computer is acting strange, and it's pretty old, so I think it might be dying. How can I tell for sure?  A. Computers can die unexpectedly, but most will give you some signs first. If several programs are freezing or causing problems, that's a sure sign something is wrong. The same goes for hardware problems like a misbehaving mouse, odd glitches on your monitor, or loud noises coming from the computer that you haven't heard before. I would make sure your important information is backed up and start saving up for a new computer. Click here for more sure signs your computer is dying and how to tell if it's a problem you can fix yourself.  Safety app you need on your phone  Q. My daughter is away at college and I worry about her safety at parties and wherever else she goes. Is there an app she can put on her smartphone to let me know if she needs help?  A. Tell her to take a look at KiteString. She can tell the free service to check in on her via text at a certain time. If she doesn't respond, KiteString will alert you with her location. This leaves your daughter in control of her safety (which is important), and you don't have to worry unless she's actually in trouble. Of course, there are other safety apps that are also great for college students and anyone else. Click here for two more must-have safety apps: one that makes it easy to get help from friends and the other that puts the police on standby in tense situations.  Q. I accidentally deleted a folder of family photos, and they weren't backed up. Can they be rescued?  A. They should be in Windows' Recycle Bin or Mac's Trash. Go to the Recycle Bin on the Windows desktop or the Trash icon on the Mac dock. In Recycle Bin, right-click on the folder and select \"Restore.\" In Trash, drag the folder back to your Pictures directory. If for some reason you emptied the Recycle Bin or Trash with the folder in there, hope is not lost. Even after you delete files, they stay around on the hard drive until new files replace them. A free file-recovery program like Recuva might help you recover some of them if you move fast.

The Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Phanfone was off the coast of Shikoku in southwestern Japan on Sunday night, local time, packing winds of up to 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour after hitting the southern regions of Okinawa and Kyushu. The typhoon was downgraded from the status of super typhoon, Reuters reported.  Japan's Coast Guard said three U.S. Air Force members were washed away by high waves Sunday, with one found dead and the other two still missing. The Air Force said only that three of its airmen were missing.  Several people on Kyushu island were injured.  The agency predicted up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) of rain in central Japan by Monday morning.  A spokesperson for Toyota said the company plans to suspend production at 12 plants in Japan on Monday because of the storm, according to Reuters.

The Kastles were a part of the national sports conversation, thanks in part to the alignment with the Lakers, who previously held the title.

        "article": "Hundreds of volunteers will be fanning out this week to count the homeless in Los Angeles city and county.  The census, which begins Tuesday night, is conducted every two years and will take three days to complete.  “If we’re really serious about ending homelessness, we have to know what the problem is and how big it is,” said Calvin J. Fortenberry, spokesman for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which organizes the count.  Similar counts are taking place this week across the country. To qualify for federal funding to assist the homeless, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department requires communities to count their homeless populations on a given day every two years. Federal housing officials define the homeless as people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing, or in places not fit for human habitation such as sidewalks, cars, parks and abandoned buildings.  The L.A. city-county count, which covers about 4,000 square miles, is the nation’s largest. It begins Tuesday in the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles, then moves to West Los Angeles and the South Bay Cities on Wednesday, and finishes Thursday in the Antelope Valley, San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, the Los Angeles metropolitan area and South Los Angeles.  The 2009 census identified nearly 43,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, excluding the cities of Glendale, Pasadena and Long Beach, which conduct their own counts. When the results were added from those cities, it was found that more than 48,000 people were homeless on any given night in the county.  That was a 38% drop from 2007, a result met with skepticism among homeless service providers who said they were seeing more people -- particularly families -- because of the recession.  Advocates for the homeless will be watching to see whether the numbers have risen since then, especially as the economic downturn started worsening only a few months before the last count was conducted.  Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority Executive Director Michael Arnold said the city and county have been investing in housing and other programs to get people off the streets, which could help account for the drop measured two years ago.  Methodological improvements have also helped the city-county authority “get closer to a true number,” he said. In 2005, the count was based on results taken from about 20% of the total area. This year, Arnold expects to cover about 50%.  Nearly 4,000 volunteers have indicated that they would take part and more are welcome.  “It’s really a positive experience to see so many people from different parts of the community coming together on such an important issue,” Arnold said in a statement. “The count is just the first step in my eyes to getting to the real goal of moving people into permanent housing.”  A more detailed survey is planned in February to collect information on gender, ethnicity, the chronically homeless, veterans, homeless families, unaccompanied youth, people living with HIV or mental illness, substance abuse and victims of domestic violence.  Pasadena and Glendale will be conducting their counts on Wednesday and Long Beach will follow on Thursday.

As it turns out, billions of pounds. According to brand consultancy Brand Finance, the Royal Family is set to make a net contribution of £1.15 billion (around $1.77 billion) to the U.K. economy. The institution itself is valued at around £57 billion ($87 billion), providing some fascinating evidence that the monarchy brings more benefit than burden to the British people.  “The principle of whether monarchy is an appropriate and fair form of government in the 21st century certainly remains open to question. However, Brand Finance’s research shows that from an economic standpoint at least, the royalists firmly have the upper hand,” Brand Finance Chief Executive David Haigh said in a statement.  We break down the benefits of the monarchy in the chart below, showing that the Queen brings in the most dough from waving at eager, photo-happy tourists:  There are several “Effects” that have contributed to the Royal Family’s economic power. The most essential of these factors is the “Kate Effect,” or the “uplift to fashion and other brands worn, used or otherwise endorsed” by Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge whose fashion choices have prompted a consumer frenzy. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are the offspring of Kate and Prince William, and their brand endorsements have contributed its fair share to the British coffers.  There are costs, however, to the privilege of saying “long live the Queen.”  This includes the “Sovereign Grant,” which is the amount of money provided by the government to the monarchy. Other high costs are dedicated to the security detail around the Royal Family and the lost of income attributed to the country’s two royal, Game of Thrones-sounding private estates, the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster.",

They said they are keeping their children out of the school because they worry they won't safe.  \"I'm worried about these new teachers,\" said Maria Vargas, 47, in Spanish. \"We don't know who they are.\"  The school's reopening follows revelations that 200 more inappropriate photos of children were discovered, and that one teacher sent warmly written birthday cards and presents to students who participated in his games.  Teacher Mark Berndt sent birthday cards to some of the girls, asking how they were adjusting to the fourth grade, according to three lawsuits filed against the district. He also is accused of writing notes such as \"surely no teacher could ever have a more wonderful student than you!!\" and \"P.P.S. The Roaches SayT 'Hi!' \"  The notes were signed \"Mr. B.\"  The cards were provided as exhibits in lawsuits filed Tuesday on behalf of three former Berndt students. The suits allege the district and Principal Martin Sandoval failed to adequately safeguard the students against Berndt and a second teacher arrested, Martin Springer, who faces three lewdness charges in connection with the fondling of a second-grader.  Berndt, 61, taught at Miramonte for 32 years. He remains jailed on $23 million bail and could face life in prison if convicted.  The furor over his arrest led two parents to come forward last week to complain about Springer, who had worked at the school for 26 years.  Springer, 49, pleaded not guilty after he was charged with committing three lewd acts upon one girl in 2009. Bail was set at $300,000. Authorities said there is no evidence that Berndt and Springe acted in concert  Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators said they have found 200 additional photos they believe were taken by Berndt who is accused of committing lewd acts on 23 children from 2005 to 2010.  The photos were found late last week at the same pharmacy where a photo lab technician had first noticed odd pictures that led to Berndt's arrest, sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez said. The recent discovery brings the total number of photos to roughly 600.  Many of the photos involve children already identified by authorities, but there may be other victims, Marquez said.  Like the other pictures, the photos show children ages 6 to 10 blindfolded and being fed a milky, white liquid authorities said they believe was semen on spoons or cookies. A blue plastic spoon and container found in trash in Berndt's classroom tested positive for semen, according to the sheriff's department.  Attorneys Greg Owen and Jessica Dominguez, who represent eight of the alleged victims and their families, say more lawsuits will be filed next week.  Owen alleged that Berndt targeted quiet or vulnerable children, but also ingriatiated himself with parents. Neither attorney revealed details about what the victims have said, but said all were meeting with pyschologists. Dominguez said parents have taken the children to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases.  Some parents have not stepped forward because they are in the country illegally and fear deportation, the attorneys said.  Meanwhile, in a press conference outside the school Thursday, Teacher Union president Warren Fletcher said that the district's move to replace all of Miramonte's teachers is \"nothing more than a cheap media stunt intended to deflect attention from the fact that a tragedy occurred at the school that had no supervision.\"  Fletcher said the school had no assistant principals to help the one principal oversee the entire staff. As he spoke parents cheered.  A group of girls playing the guitar sang songs they made up about their teachers leaving. Police patrolled the front of the school to allow parents who were bringing their children to school safely inside.  \"It's kind of hard,\" said Lorena Sorian, whose sixth-grader attends Miramonte. \"You barely know your teacher, and they're gone. The kids don't know what's going on.\"  Sorian said the arrest of the two teachers made her think twice about enrolling her younger children at Miramonte next fall.  A new school currently is under construction nearby.  Los Angeles Unified School District officials closed the school on Tuesday and Wednesday to completely replace the 120-member staff.  Superintendent John Deasy said the move was necessary to restore trust among parents in the largely poor, Latino neighborhood of unincorporated Los Angeles County.  Deasy has said he will decide whether any of the previous staff will return to Miramonte after the district completes its investigation.  Fletcher claimed Thursday that none of the instructors will be allowed back. He said some 85 teachers received notice of administrative transfer on Wednesday. He claimed the educators were being \"tarred and stigmatized for no reason.\"  The union will file grievances and appeal to the school board to overrule Deasy's decision, Fletcher said.  Spokeswoman Monica Carazo said the district would not immediately respond to Fletcher's claim or comment on whether such notices had been sent out.  The new staff includes a retired principal, 88 teachers and dozens of support staff who were recently laid off and were on a rehiring list.  The new hires alone will cost the cash-strapped district $5.7 million, district spokesman Thomas Waldman told the Los Angeles Times. There will be a counselor in each classroom for the rest of the school year.  Teachers and staff who were removed will be paid. They eventually will be kept at an unfinished high school nearby, and some teachers will help plan future curriculum for Miramonte, Deasy told radio station KNX.  Although the teachers will be new, Miramonte students will find little else changed, Deasy said.  \"They are coming right back to their desks, their work is already on the wall,\" he said. \"What we are doing today is providing students with an opportunity to talk about what has happened.\"  In addition to those costs, the district faces potentially millions of dollars in legal costs as lawsuits are filed. Families of at least two dozen Miramonte students have retained lawyers so far, the Times said.  Detectives said there is no evidence that the two men acted in concert.",

James McElvar was traveling from Stansted outside London to Scotland's Glasgow airport on budget carrier EasyJet. The airline permits passengers just one piece of hand luggage but the singer had already packed a suitcase and small backpack to take on the flight.  At the gate, an agent reminded McElvar of the policy.  “The woman told me either one of my bags went in the hold or we weren't getting on.

But as soon as the flight was airborne, McElvar began to feel ill almost immediately. As his body temperature soared, McElvar says he began to feel “weak,” light-headed and started sweating profusely. After violently throwing up, the singer was relocated to different seat but soon passed out. He was taken to a hospital immediately upon landing in Glasgow and treated for heat exhaustion.  Fans of the band began sharing their concern over social media, but according to Rewind’s official Twitter account, McElvar is making a speedy recovery.  For everyone asking James is ok.

        "article": "Everyone wants a nice boss. And if a nice boss is one who respects me and my work, challenges me to get better and wants to see me grow as both a professional and a leader, then I’m for it too.  Just because you have a nice boss, doesn’t mean you have a good boss  But too many people look at a hard-charging boss and jump to the conclusion that he or she is a tyrant.  Here’s what these people don’t get: just because you have a nice boss, doesn’t mean you have a good boss.  I’ve seen plenty of bosses who might talk the talk about demanding exceptional performance but, all too often, they just want employees to like them. What’s more, they want people to speak well of them, to be “friends” with them. This type of boss is afraid that if they set high performance targets and challenge their staff to meet and surpass them, their esteem will slip. As a result, they ease up on their expectations, sometimes without realising it. Not surprisingly, performance falters.  These immensely successful bosses don’t care much about being liked  Some of the best leaders I’ve seen, whether in research or coaching, come to work with a razor-sharp focus on results. These immensely successful bosses don’t care much about being liked. Their expectations are both staggering and non-negotiable — and their teams know it.  Take, for example, US real estate guru Bill Sanders. “Everybody knew that Bill demanded results,” said Ronald Blankenship, former chairman and CEO of Verde Realty, a real estate investment trust and long-time associate of Sanders. “If you were going to work with him, you needed to be prepared to make that your primary focus.”  These great leaders are not afraid to lay down the law — they don’t hesitate for an instant. And paradoxically, their toughness, accompanied by their adherence to their unique and inspiring visions, often generates more esteem among their reports, not less.  How do you know if you’re falling prey to the Nice Boss Syndrome?  In fact, it generates something greater than mere esteem among most employees: A profound respect, loyalty, even love.  Of course, being tough doesn’t mean being offensive. How do you know if you’re falling prey to the Nice Boss Syndrome? Consider these questions — and keep track of your yesses.  If you find yourself answering “yes” to three or more of these questions, you might be suffering from Nice Boss Syndrome. In that case, it’s time to change your ways. If you want to be respected, not just liked:  “Nice” bosses may feel good about themselves, but they don’t get world-class results. Demanding bosses do. And if you work for a nice boss, don’t get too self-satisfied. If you aren’t getting better at whatever you do for a living, and learning and growing in the process, you’re not just standing still, you’re really falling behind.  In the modern business world – where competition can come from anyone and anywhere, anytime – just getting by is not a winning formula.

        "article": "MANCHESTER, N.H. — The last major debate of the 2014 midterms had the real potential to alter a race. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, whose lead over Republican Scott Brown had steadily diminished since this summer, looked to have stabilized her numbers. Brown, one of the most media-savvy candidates for any office in America, had done well enough to keep national Republicans spending money on the race in case a wave hit in the last week. Two previous televised debates had gone rather poorly for Shaheen; the first, with a studio audience, produced a clip of voters laughing at the senator, and that's still being repurposed for negative ads.  But Shaheen found her sea legs at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. She got some of the same questions that had been lobbed her way at CNN's terror, Ebola-focused debate (which was, ironically, little-seen in the state thanks to breaking Ebola news). She had her best answers to Brown's attacks on her low NFIB and Chamber of Commerce ratings, and her almost-perfect rating of votes in alignment with President Obama.  “I guess I should have been a little more specific.”  Brown attempted to stoke outrage over how Shaheen referred to the possibility of using ground troops in Iraq. It started harmlessly enough, with Shaheen repeatedly hitting Brown for being willing to re-occupy Iraq.  \"What we should not do is take tens of thousands of troops and send them back to Iraq as an occupying force,\" said Shaheen. \"I don't think we should have tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for 60 years, as we have in Korea.\"  Brown summoned a kind of outrage. \"With respect to Sen. Shaheen,\" said Brown. \"We are a liberating force. We are not occupiers. I, and every other person in the military, resents that you are calling us occupiers.\"  Shaheen, who has a habit of starting answers with an awkward um, did so then slapped away the bait. \"What you have suggested and what others have suggested is that we should go back into Iraq,\" she said.  Brown obviously wanted this answer to stick; plenty of ads on New Hampshire radio and TV play up his National Guard service. In a short scrum with reporters, after the debate, Brown led off by defending troops from the \"occupiers\" label. An NPR reporter repeatedly pressed Brown to say whether \"the Iraqi people\" considered Americans occupiers.  \"You'd have to ask the Iraqi people,\" said Brown.  Brown has failed to personally win over New Hampshire voters the way he did in Massachusetts in 2010. In polls this time around, he's consistently been viewed less favorably than three-time governor Shaheen. But he remains innately talented at connecting to an audience; Shaheen, less so. She gave a bureaucratic, gaffe-free response to a question about the Obama administration's efforts to stop a ransom being paid for James Foley, while Brown turned the question into a movie-of-the-week script.  \"Imagine if that happened to your child,\" he said. \"I would have done anything and everything to get a child home.\" He pivoted to a larger, passionate argument about a government \"chipping away at our rights and freedoms.\"  It was such an unexpected pitch that it was hard to determine whether it connected. But that was the rhythm, with Shaheen attempting to defend the major impacts of policies and Brown making them personal. Brown parried an attack on his opportune move to New Hampshire from Massachusetts, explaining it as motivated by \"my wife and my personal family choices.\" An attack on his votes against equal pay bills ignored that he paid women on his staff $1.25 for every dollar a man made. (This sort of argument has been made by Republicans all year, a little fun with averages to blunt a policy debate.)  Earlier today, an irritating Bloomberg Politics reporter wrote about a radio interview Brown gave in which he warned \"polio and whooping cough\" were crossing the border. Shaheen mocked him for that—polio has not existed in the western hemisphere since the 1990s—and Brown explained that he was talking about a similar disease, but not polio. Later, when gun rights came up, Brown accused her of supporting \"a letter to the UN signing away our rights.\"  \"He talks about UN legislation,\" Shaheen replied dismissively. \"That’s a bogus issue.\" It mostly is— the Small Arms Treaty is an occasionally hot topic in the conservative press, but a less than real threat to the guns owned by American citizens.  Shaheen benefits in two ways when Brown is discussing red-meat conservative issues. One: She can point out the small evolutions Brown went through when he moved from heavily liberal Massachusetts to swingy New Hampshire. Two: She can remind conservative voters, who have largely but not entirely consolidated behind Brown, that he's backed anti-gun bills, which they hate and been moderate on abortion, where they see no room for moderation.  The closest thing to a classic gaffe—i.e., an error about some ridiculous and not materially important matter—came when WMUR reporter James Pindell asked Brown about the economy in the western part of the state, like Sullivan County. Brown condemned the Obamacare as the reason some ski resorts closed early during the last tourist season.  \"We're talking about Sullivan County,\" said Pindell. \"I think you're talking about the north country.\"  \"I'm talking about any place past Concord,\" said Brown, who continued to talk about the resorts.  \"Sullivan County is west of Concord,\" said Pindell. \"It's not north of Concord.\"  It sounded like exactly the ephemera that a recent New Hampshire arrival would miss, and a governor like Shaheen never would. After the debate, Brown denied making a true error.  \"It's north,\" he said. \"It's north west. I guess I should have been a little more specific.\"",

But guests heading to the ceremony and dinner that awarded this year’s Pritzker Prize— often called the Nobel of architecture —to Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of the Japanese firm Sanaa were greeted by an altogether different sign of the times: a line leading to airport-like security.  On May 17, for the first time since 1983, when I. M. Pei was bestowed the honor at the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pritzker Prize ceremony took place in New York: specifically, on Ellis Island. And for the huddled masses yearning to partake in architecture’s biggest night of the year, head lice exams gave way to X-ray scanners, as design titans, masters of the universe and assorted well-coiffed others awkwardly deposited their Constructivist jewelry and Ferragamo belts in plastic bins on conveyors.  “I wonder, just how much metal is Sejima wearing?” Anthony Vidler, the architecture dean at the Cooper Union, said jokingly about the night’s co-honoree as he waited patiently for the boat to depart for the island.  Still, with buckles readjusted and bangles back on wrists, any inconveniences were soon forgotten as the evening took on a lightness befitting Sanaa’s sublimely elegant buildings: the see-through Glass Pavilion for the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio; the undulating slice of Swiss cheese that is the Rolex Learning Center in Lausanne; the mesh-clad New Museum on the Bowery.  “Sanaa did my store on Crosby Street,” said the fashion designer Derek Lam, sipping red wine as a string quartet played. “That’s why we’re here to celebrate them.”  Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, Mr. Lam’s partner and the company’s C.E.O., said, “Actually, Sejima was our first customer when we started the business.”  “She got a black double-breasted trench coat,” Mr. Lam said.  “It was more like a Bordeaux red.”  “No, it was definitely black.”  For her part, Ms. Sejima, who is doing double duty this year as director of the Venice Architecture Biennale, was standing with Mr. Nishizawa near the Peopling of America exhibition. A petite woman, she was coddled within the voluminous, definitely black, ruffle-dappled dress that the Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo had made for her.  “I am very pleased to be here,” Ms. Sejima said before flashing a warm smile and being whisked away for a cigarette break.  Founded by the late Jay Pritzker and his wife, Cindy, of the Hyatt hotel fortune, the Pritzker Prize was started in 1979; Philip Johnson was its first recipient. It has become architecture’s most prestigious honor, its adjectival use signaling the subject’s place in the pantheon of living architects.  In the first century B.C., Vitruvius assigned to great buildings the three attributes of firmitas, utilitas, venustas: firmness, commodity, delight. Pritzker winners receive a bronze medal inscribed with that motto and translation, and $100,000.  But perhaps it’s the canonization of the Architectus Celebritatus, that exotic species also known as the starchitect — a crossbreed between temperamental artist and brilliant problem-solver, idealistic do-gooder and opportunistic megalomaniac, starchy geek and shameless glamour puss — that is the prize’s most enduring legacy.  There, in one corner, were the lanky Thom Mayne (Pritzker, ’05) and Renzo Piano (’98), grazing not far from Christian de Portzamparc (’94) and the silver-haired Richard Meier (’84). Though not a Pritzker winner, Rafael Vinoly appeared, as he usually does, as the eight-eyed savant wearing three pairs of spectacles: on the nose, around the neck and propped on his head, all at the same time.  Frank Gehry (’89), whose own Pritzker ceremony took place in Nara, Japan — “As a student, I learned how to make tatami mats and was in a gagaku orchestra,” he reminisced — could be spotted in head-to-toe black and, at 81, looking slimmer than before. “I go up and down,” he shrugged.  At 8 p.m. it was feeding time, and the crowd of 400-plus was ushered into the soaring, barrel-vaulted Great Hall. Looking across the moodily lighted space blooming with peony table centerpieces, one could guess at the conversations taking place: about how shockingly few of the New Yorkers had been to Ellis Island. About how many Sanaa buildings one had visited. About anything but Atlantic Yards and Beekman Tower’s flying construction debris, if Mr. Gehry was within earshot.  Perhaps too lubricated by the wine and professional self-affirmation, the crowd seemed to dwell surprisingly little on how tough business has been. Then again, besides an affection for sushi, baseball and prepubescent pop icons, whether animated or human, the United States and Japan had something besides doldrums to share on this night.  “In Japan, we’ve had problems with Toyota, with other companies, with politics,” said Keiko Sainowaki, a Tokyo magazine editor who had flown in for the event. “But this award — it’s been very, very good news.”",

        "article": "Alex Smith was quick to address the only bummer of his otherwise glorious weekend.  \"I was keeping the ball down, working the count, had an open base,\" he said with a straight face.  On Saturday night, Smith threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Giants' playoff game, missing the target Sergio Romo set for him and bouncing the ball to the right of home plate. Afterward Smith shook his head, said he was disgusted with himself and vowed to stick to football. Then he rode back to the team hotel to finish preparing for the Bills.  Twenty hours later he was at Candlestick Park, making every throw, hitting every target and putting together the best day of his NFL career.  \"Our quarterback was near perfect,\" Jim Harbaugh said.  That wasn't just Harbaugh Hyperbole. Smith's passer rating was 156.2, 2.1 points shy of perfection. He passed for more than 300 yards - the first time ever in a regular-season victory. And he ran for 49 yards, the most rushing yards in his career.  All those stats pale next to the ones he cares about: 45-3, the final score; and 4-1, the 49ers record, tied for second best in the league.  \"It's the best, to get a win like that,\" Smith said.  The 49ers set a franchise record for offensive output Sunday. Think about that for a moment: They were more productive than any Joe Montana or Steve Young team ever was. The 49ers' 621 yards surpassed the previous record of 598, set 20 years ago also against their foil, the Bills.  \"Very cool,\" Smith said. \"When you think of the 49ers, you think of great offense. I'm honored.\"  The 49ers set an NFL record - the first team in history to pass for 300 yards and rush for 300 yards in the same game. Granted, this milestone comes at the expense of a very bad team. If common denominators mean anything, the 49ers figured on a big day: The Bills lost 48-28 to the Jets, whom the 49ers shut out 34-0. The Bills have given up 97 points in two weeks, to Tom Brady's Patriots and Smith's 49ers.  But, in at least one way, that makes Sunday's victory even more impressive. This was a trap game by any definition, coming on the heels of the emotional Camp Harbaugh in Youngstown, Ohio, and a week before the highly charged NFC Championship Game rematch with the Giants. There's no doubt that Freddie P. Soft - Harbaugh's complacency avatar - was banging on the door of the locker room. But he couldn't get in.  \"Everybody brought their 'A' game today,\" said offensive coordinator Greg Roman.  The win allowed the 49ers to keep pace with Arizona in the division and stay within a game of undefeated NFC leader Atlanta and a game ahead of the Giants, who visit Sunday for a grudge game.  \"There's a lot of baggage there,\" Smith said. \"A little unfinished business, I guess.\"  Smith seems intent on finishing up business, conquering his past demons and doubters. The 300-yard mark was a milestone that had eluded him in any regular-season victory. He had twice passed for more than 300 yards, once in a loss in Seattle in 2009 and then against Philadelphia in 2010, in a game that had the fans actually chanting for David Carr.  \"That seems like a long time ago,\" Smith said. \"A completely different world.\"  Still, in the eyes of some, Smith still hasn't proved himself. The unfinished business in recent weeks was getting the ball downfield. There's been a lot of chatter that Smith couldn't make the deep throw, restricting the 49ers. When backup Colin Kaepernick uncorked a deep pass to Randy Moss against the Jets, the cry went up that Kap was the man.  It's unlikely that Roman and Harbaugh devise their game plan to shut up sports talk critics, but sometimes it seems that way. On Sunday, Smith unleashed several deep throws, including a 33-yard pass to Vernon Davis (who gained 20 yards after the catch) and a 28-yard pass in the air to Kyle Williams, who caught it over his back shoulder, spun and ran 15 yards into the end zone.  \"It's been a priority for us,\" Smith said. \"It just came up today; we were a little more aggressive.\"  With 10 minutes to play, Smith came out of the game and put on a baseball cap, though not one with the banned Giants logo. It was the end of a pretty good week.  Smith got a pep talk from Willie Mays, the original hero of Candlestick Park. He received possibly his loudest ovation ever in the city of San Francisco, when he took the mound at AT&T to throw out the pitch. He surpassed Young and Montana in the record books.  Good thing he had that pitch in the dirt to keep him humble.

        "article": "There’s no longer much doubt that the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) poses some health risks, both physically and behaviorally. It’s been linked to cancer, diabetes, reproductive problems, and behavioral problems in children. The chemical has been banned in sippy cups and bottles, and advocates have petitioned for its ban in adult products, too. The problem is that it seems to be everywhere: In plastic bottles, the lining of tin cans, in dental fillings, and in cash register receipt paper. And this last source was the main interest of a new study in the journal PLOS ONE. The authors tested people’s BPA levels before and after they’d handled receipt paper – and eaten with BPA-contaminated fingers – and were a little alarmed by what they found. Whether it’s really cause for concern remains to be seen.  “Our research found that large amounts of BPA can be transferred to your hands and then to the food you hold and eat as well as be absorbed through your skin,” said lead author Frederick vom Saal. “BPA exhibits hormone-like properties and has been proven to cause reproductive defects in fetuses, infants, children and adults as well as cancer, metabolic and immune problems in rodents. BPA from thermal papers will be absorbed into your blood rapidly; at those levels, many diseases such as diabetes and disorders such as obesity increase as well.”  In the new study, vom Saal and his team had people come into the lab and handle receipt paper. Some of the participants used hand sanitizer before doing so, which, like sunscreen and lotions, is known to make skin super-absorbent. As an added real-world task, some of the participants also ate French fries with their BPA-contaminated fingers. BPA levels were measured in skin, urine, and blood before and after the different treatments.  The team found that 45 seconds of handling the receipt paper made BPA levels on the skin jump up to 581 ug BPA (just 2 seconds of handling the papers transferred 40% of the total amount). The levels went down to 73% of the maximum after 4 minutes, possibly because it was being absorbed into the skin.  When the team measured BPA levels in the urine or in the blood serum of the participants 90 minutes after handling the receipts, their levels were also higher, at 20 mg BPA/g creatinine: This is as high, the authors say, as the levels previous studies have shown to be linked with heart risk and type 2 diabetes risk. The differences were greater in women than in men, for reasons that aren’t totally clear.  Although the study was quite small and more research will be needed, it may be worth passing up store receipts, if you can help it. The issue may be more of a concern for cashiers, who handle receipts all day long, and who may regularly use hand sanitizer to protect against illness.  “Store and fast food receipts, airline tickets, ATM receipts and other thermal papers all use massive amounts of BPA on the surface of the paper as a print developer,” says vom Saal. “The problem is, we as consumers have hand sanitizers, hand creams, soaps and sunscreens on our hands that drastically alter the absorption rate of the BPA found on these receipts.”  The EPA did a recent study on BPA and possible alternatives for use in thermal printing paper. Their conclusion was that no safer alternatives to BPA exist at present, and that ‘‘decision makers may wish to consider alternative printing systems.”  The American Chemical Council disagrees that BPA from sources like food containers and receipt papers can pose risk. “Due to the use of unrealistic experimental conditions,” said Steven G. Hentges, “much of the data presented in this new study has very limited relevance to the potential for human exposure to BPA from handling thermal receipt paper…. Typical BPA exposure from all sources is about 1,000 times below safe intake levels set by government bodies in the U.S., Canada and Europe.” Although past research has shown similar results to the current study, it will probably take a few more studies and a few more years before the current practices are changed, given the amount of debate about the “dose” that would be needed to affect our health. But just to be sure, if you’re worried, just say “no thanks” when anyone asks if you want a receipt. And if they try to push a receipt on you, run. But don’t forget to explain the findings of the new study to the cashier before you do.  Follow me @alicewalton or find me on Facebook.",

        "article": "Last year, President Obama and House Republicans managed to reach a last-minute accord on preserving the Bush tax cuts, and then in April they just barely averted a government shutdown. But now, in this debate over the debt ceiling, each side seems ready to make a stand at last and find out whom the voters really trust when it comes to righting the nation’s finances. Matt Bai’s analysis and commentary.  Matt Bai’s analysis and commentary.  The question is who you would rather be if this thing does, in fact, escalate into a full-blown crisis. As things stand today, I’d much rather be in the president’s shoes than in those of his adversaries, and not only because he tends to dress better.  I say this because politicians very often get themselves into trouble when they subscribe to what you might call the transference theory of political popularity. This is the theory that suggests that the enemy of the person voters don’t trust is someone they will inherently trust more. Or to put it another way: if you’ve lost faith in that guy over there, and I walk up and kick him in the teeth, then your faith will be somehow transferred to me.  This is the political theory under which George W. Bush’s advisers were operating when they predicted spontaneous outpourings of support from Iraqis once American troops toppled Saddam Hussein. Anyone who’d spent a little time in Iraq should have known that while most Iraqis were going to be glad to be rid of Saddam, that didn’t mean they were ready to embrace his deposer, either.  And this is effectively the same theory that Republicans in Washington have adopted since last November. They mistake disappointment with Obama’s policies for an emphatic validation of their antigovernment rhetoric. They think the voters have to trust someone, and since they’re not so enamored of Mr. Obama’s performance, that someone must be them.  But politics really isn’t binary; it only seems that way. It’s possible for voters to rebuke Mr. Obama and trust his opposition even less. And in fact, polling shows that’s exactly what’s going on.  In a New York Times/CBS News poll from a few weeks ago, Mr. Obama maintained a tepid approval rating of 47 percent, with 44 percent of the voters registering disapproval. But only 20 percent approved of Congress, versus 70 percent who disapproved. Those are Roger Clemens-type numbers. They don’t get you anywhere near the Hall of Fame.  Polls also show that the president remains personally liked by large majority of the public. But really, the discrepancy in their approval ratings probably has less to do with Mr. Obama or House leaders personally than it does with the nature of our system. Presidents always seem bigger and more commanding than members of Congress. Even a beaten-down president tends to be more compelling than some guy who needs to wear a lapel pin just to make sure he can ride the right elevator.  This is why President Clinton squashed his Republican opponents during the government shutdown in 1996 and again after his impeachment in 1998. Even disgraced, he managed to come off like the only grownup in town, a real-life Gulliver tottering while tiny people scurried to bind his ankles together. The Republican nominee in next year’s election, whoever that turns out to be, might be able to stare down Mr. Obama on something as consequential as the debt ceiling and come away looking larger and more capable. But not so for your average Congressional leader, which is probably why the shrewd Mr. Boehner appeared so eager to cut a deal until his caucus rebelled over the weekend.  Working in Mr. Obama’s favor, too, is that he seems now to understand this power dynamic and how to use it. Earlier in his presidency, Mr. Obama seemed to think he could best his opponents by appealing to their sense of shared responsibility and chatting them up at Super Bowl parties. It didn’t work.  Now, though, he seems to get that a president wins when he boxes in his adversaries, forcing them either to compromise on his terms or to risk the political consequences of appearing intransigent. For the past week or so, the president has relentlessly sought the mantle of maturity, casting himself as the guy seeking bold and far-reaching compromise while his opponents seek the lower ground of marginal change.  Republicans may be right on this point; it may not be the wisest thing in the world to remake the entire federal budget in the space of a furious few days. But to the extent that Mr. Obama gets his message across more effectively, he hands Republicans the unenviable choice or either joining him in a comprehensive solution or looking self-interested for backing away and imperiling the economy.  Does that mean voters won’t blame Mr. Obama for a crisis over the debt ceiling? It doesn’t. But they’ll probably blame Congress even more. If you’re Republican right now, the flawed theory of transference is one you’d probably rather not put to the test.",

        "article": "On the morning of July 30, in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, an Imam named Juma Tahir led prayers to mark Eid al-Fitr. Soon after, the 74-year-old was found stabbed to death outside his 600-year-old Mosque. His murder capped days of violence in China’s vast and troubled northwest — and, many fear, augured conflict to come.  The territory that is today called Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is, and has long been, contested space. The oasis towns that circle the Taklamakan desert are claimed as both the homeland of the mostly Muslim, Turkic Uighur people, and, off-and-on for centuries, as Chinese land. With the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the ruling Communist Party sent forth waves of military personnel to settle the area. They have since been joined by migrants from the Chinese heartland, most but not all of whom, are from the ethnic Han majority; in 1949, Han people accounted for only about 6% of Xinjiang’s population; today, the figure is more than 40%.  The influx has left Xinjiang at odds. Beijing says integration with the rest of China is revitalizing the region, bringing money and jobs to the long-neglected west. Uighurs counter that they have yet to reap the benefits of the economic boom, and worry that their language, religion, and culture are threatened. Many want greater independence for the land they call East Turkestan. A small minority has fought for it, waging a decade-long insurgency that has mostly targeted local symbols of state power, including police stations, transportation hubs and government offices.  This year, the unrest moved east. In Oct. 2013, an SUV driven by three members of a Uighur family plowed through crowds of holidaymakers in the heart of Beijing, killing 5, including the occupants, at the northern end of Tiananmen Square. In March, a group of black-clad attackers stabbed and slashed their way through a train-station in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, killing 29. State media blamed the bloody ambush and two subsequent attacks in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, on religious extremists.  The surge in violence prompted the government to tighten its grip on Xinjiang. Its town squares are now patrolled by police officers carrying automatic weapons. Across the Uighur heartland, villages are sealed by police checkpoints. Mistaking cultural practice for evidence of extremist thought, local governments are monitoring people’s habits and dress: There have been campaigns to stop students and civil students from fasting during the Muslim holy month, age restrictions on Mosque visits, and, most recently, in Karamay, an ill-conceived move to ban women wearing veils, and men sporting beards, from the city’s public buses.  Kashgar, where Getty photographer Kevin Frayer made these pictures, is at the heart of all this. Sitting at the westernmost fringe of the People’s Republic, closer to Baghdad than Beijing, it has for centuries been a meeting point and trading hub, the place that connected Constantinople (now Istanbul) to Xi’an, before playing host to Britain and Russia’s spies during the 19th centuries “Great Game.” A good portion of the alleys and warrens they wrote home about have since been bulldozed; China will flatten 85% of the old city — an unpopular project that is well underway.  It was outside the city, in Kashgar Prefecture, Shache County, that the most recent spate of bloodshed took root. What happened there on July 27 is still disputed and, because outside journalists are effectively barred from the area, facts are scarce. Chinese state media initially said “dozens” were killed. Later, they revised the official account, reporting that 96 people, including 37 civilians and 59 terrorists, died in a rampage masterminded by extremists. Their account is at odds with reporting by Radio Free Asia, a non-profit news service, that linked the incident to state-led violence and suppression during Ramadan.  Days later, outside China’s largest Mosque, Imam Tahir was killed. China’s state news-wire, Xinhua, reported his alleged assasins were “influenced by religious extremism” and plotted to “do something big” to increase their influence. Other non-state outlets were quick to note, though, that Tahir was not just any Imam, but a state-sanctioned one. He held a position in the government-run China Islamic Association and was often quoted backing the Party line. Was that was got him killed?  That, like much else, remains unclear. But from wherever you stand, the murder feels like a grisly message: The lines are drawn; pick a side.",

        "article": "Aside from the exertion – or electronically-assisted ease – of the whisking itself, meringues are blissfully easy to make. With just egg whites and sugar as the two base ingredients, there’s plenty of scope to experiment with additional flavours in your meringue – perhaps brown sugar, vanilla, chopped nuts, coffee or chocolate. There are only a couple of important things to bear in mind: the first is to make sure that the bowl and whisk you use are perfectly clean and grease-free before whisking; the second is to mix any additional ingredients in after the meringue mixture has reached stiff peak stage (where the meringue, when the whisk is slowly lifted from it, holds in straight, well-defined spikes).  This meringue base is enriched with dark chocolate and cocoa, so it steers clear of sickly sweetness, sitting instead somewhere between the lightness of a conventional meringue and the fudgy depth of a chocolate brownie. I love the shock of golden cream as a counterpoint to the chocolate, but if saffron’s not to your taste you can stick to vanilla instead.  Serves 6-8100g dark chocolate5 large eggs, yolks and whites separated200g caster sugar5 tbsp cocoa powder  For the filling300ml double cream2 pinches of saffron2 tsp vanilla extract50g caster sugarIcing sugar, to dust  1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 20x30cm roasting tin or swiss roll tray with baking parchment.  2 Melt the chocolate either in the microwave or in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Once melted, leave to cool slightly then whisk in the egg yolks, 2 tbsp of the sugar and the cocoa powder.  3 Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until foamy and holding firm (if ill-defined) peaks. Add the remaining caster sugar a little at a time, whisking well between each addition. Continue to whisk until the meringue holds stiff peaks.  4 Mix a quarter of the meringue into the chocolate mixture to slacken it, then gently fold in the rest of the meringue. Work lightly and swiftly, cutting the ingredients together using a metal spoon or spatula. The more air you can keep in the mixture, the better. Transfer to the prepared tin, gently level the top and bake for 25 minutes. The top should have risen to a light crust. Leave to cool on a wire rack, and don’t panic if it sinks and cracks a little.  5 While the roulade base cools, prepare the cream filling. Heat 100ml of the cream in a small pan with the saffron until scalding hot then leave to cool to room temperature. The saffron will dye the cream a rich yellow colour. Combine the cooled, infused mixture with the remaining cream, the vanilla extract and caster sugar. Whisk until the cream is thick and smooth, holding in soft peaks. Place in the fridge to chill.  6 Dust a sheet of baking parchment with a layer of icing sugar and turn the cooled roulade base out, upside down, on to it. Peel the original piece of baking parchment from its bottom (now its top) and slather with the chilled cream. Using the baking parchment underneath to help you, roll up gently but firmly from short edge to short edge. Transfer to a plate and put in in the fridge for at least an hour prior to serving, during which time the roulade will firm and set and its flavours will meld.  I’m not particularly keen on powdery, bright white meringues. But add a little dark brown sugar and toasted nuts to a standard meringue mix and the result is very different indeed. These meringues – which you can also fashion into meringue nests, to be heaped with cream and fresh berries – are lightly toffee-ish, nutty and chewy.  Makes 8-10100g whole blanched almonds3 large egg whites125g caster sugar60g soft dark brown sugar1 tsp vanilla extract  1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Once the oven is hot, toast the almonds for 8-10 minutes, until they’re just beginning to tan a golden brown. Leave them to cool completely, then finely chop. Reduce the oven temperature to 150C/300F/gas mark 2.  2 Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until they’re densely foamy throughout, holding in crests and waves. Add the caster sugar a quarter at a time, whisking well between each addition, then continue to whisk until the meringue holds stiff peaks. Break up any lumps in the brown sugar then add this to the meringue mixture and whisk for a further minute. Add the vanilla extract and chopped toasted almonds, folding gently to combine. Take care not to over-mix.  3 Line a couple of baking trays with baking parchment and dollop generous heaps of the meringue mixture spaced a couple of centimetres apart. If making meringue nests, you could use a piping bag, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the fuss: just use two spoons to gently nudge the meringue into shape, scooping a hollow from the centre and forming a raised lip around the edge of each one.  4 Bake for around 1½ hours until firm and crisp. The insides will still be very slightly chewy, thanks to the oil from the almonds and the soft brown sugar, but I prefer this to the sort of powdery dryness you find in shop-bought meringues.  Bitter coffee perfectly offsets the caramel meringue and blackberries. Try to choose a reasonably tart blackberry variety – one that will lift this dessert out of simple sweetness. Blackcurrants also work very well here, though it pays to stew them with a little sugar first.  Makes 66 toasted almond meringues (see recipe above)300ml double cream5 tbsp caster sugar2 tbsp very strong black coffee250g blackberries  1 Break the meringues into chunks and shards, taking care not to reduce them to dust. Whisk the double cream with the caster sugar and coffee until luxuriantly thick and holding soft peaks.  2 Cut the blackberries in half and mash very lightly, leaving most berries largely intact but just beginning to release their juices.  3 Divide these components between six glasses or small bowls, alternating layers of meringue, cream and fruit and swirling lightly together to marble them.

Teresa Sullivan was fired as president of the University of Virginia in June, then reinstated 16 days later.  James H. Ammons, the Florida A&M University president, resigned in July.  The panel imposed a less serious penalty on the University of Virginia, issuing a warning in an inquiry prompted by the short-lived ouster of its president.  Robert Champion, 26, a drum major in the Florida A&M band, the Marching 100, died in November 2011 after being beaten by fellow band members. His death was ruled a homicide, caused by blunt force trauma.  The death prompted an inquiry by the accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. James H. Ammons resigned as president of Florida A&M in July amid criticism about academic policies and hazing.  In a brief statement released on Tuesday, the commission said the university had not only violated an accrediting rule requiring “a healthy, safe and secure environment,” but also rules requiring integrity, qualified and competent leaders, and adequate control of its finances. The panel will issue a more detailed account of the charges this month.  A college placed on probation must correct the cited problems or risk losing its accreditation, which is generally seen as a death sentence because its students would lose eligibility for federal aid. Loss of accreditation is rare, and rarer still for a college as large and well-known as Florida A&M, a historically black state college in Tallahassee, with 13,000 students.  The University of Virginia’s governing body, the Board of Visitors, stunned nearly everyone there in June by firing the popular president, Teresa Sullivan, though it had never discussed dissatisfaction with her in its official meetings. Helen E. Dragas, the university rector, had orchestrated the move in private conversations with other board members.  Protest from faculty members, students and alumni ensued, and 16 days after dismissing her, the board reinstated Ms. Sullivan.  The accrediting panel placed Virginia “on warning” Tuesday, citing two rules it said the university had broken, though it did not elaborate.  One rule addresses conflicts of interest by the board of trustees, and mandates that “the board is not controlled by a minority of board members or by organizations or interests separate from it.” The other says the school must publish policies on the role of the faculty in running the university.  The board has acknowledged that it failed to give clear reasons for ousting Ms. Sullivan, leading to speculation about outside influence from wealthy donors or politicians.",

        "article": "NEW YORK – Onstage at Broadway's St. James Theatre, where Bring It On: The Musical opens Wednesday, extravagantly athletic performers are rehearsing a \"basket toss.\"  Two young women, each held up by a few people, are sent soaring above the stage, without benefit of the wires that sustain the actors playing Mary Poppins or Spider-Man a few blocks away. A moment later, they land gracefully back into their colleagues' cradled arms, and there is laughter and applause.  If you're a regular theatergoer and this feat doesn't suggest a familiar dance move, that's because it's not one. The basket toss is rather a staple of competitive cheerleading, the focus of Bring It On, which was inspired by the 2000 film of that name.  Like the movie, the new show focuses on high school cheerleaders with diverse backgrounds and dizzying chops. But the musical presents different characters and a new story, centering on a teen cheerleading whiz named Campbell (Taylor Louderman), whose world is turned upside down when she's transferred to a new high school with no squad.  \"She ends up cheerleading again,\" director/choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler says during a break from the pre-show \"stunt call,\" in which the cast runs through all the featured moves. \"But she learns that life takes you on a circuitous journey and that what's most important is to enjoy that journey and appreciate friendship.\"  Blankenbuehler, who also will choreograph this fall's revival of Annie, earned a Tony Award for his work on In the Heights— whose Tony-winning creator/composer/lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda crafted original songs for Bring It On with Tony- and Pulitzer-winning Next to Normal composer Tom Kitt and lyricist Amanda Green.  By Todd Plitt, USA TODAY  \"Cheer consultant\" Jessica Colombo and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler helped bring the new Broadway musical 'Bring It On' to life.  But the theater veteran knew nothing about the focus of Bring It On when he started the project. \"I went to an all-boys' high school in Cincinnati,\" says Blankenbuehler, 42. \"We didn't even have a cheerleading squad.\"  So with a little help from Google and Facebook, Blankenbuehler tracked down an expert: Jessica Colombo, the effervescent 27-year-old who is the show's \"cheer consultant.\" A former champion college cheerleader who spent nine years with the Universal Cheerleading Association, Colombo \"knew nothing about dance or musical theater,\" she says.  But the two schooled each other, and enlisted both cheerleaders and theater performers — more of the latter, Colombo says. \"My job was to teach the singers and dancers and actors how to do the stunts safely and correctly, and to make them look like cheerleaders. Because how you move is very different than it is in the dance world.\"  Michael Mindlin, a 29-year-old dancer in the company, agrees. \"There are a lot of (cheerleading) techniques that are counterintuitive to what I knew. Hips forward, shoulders shrugged, chest up — it's the opposite of what you'd do as a dancer. Not to mention that it's very scary the first time you chuck a girl 30 feet in the air.\"  Neil Haskell, 25, another theater pro (and So You Think You Can Dance alum) who plays Campbell's boyfriend, Steven, hadn't cheered before the show but had studied gymnastics, \"so I had that tumbling aspect down.\" Still, he has encountered challenges. \"Partnering in dance is different,\" Haskell says. \"You know how to hold the girl and keep her on center. In cheerleading, you have to do that when she's above your head, to hold a girl steadily from the bottom of her foot and read her body that way.\"  Courtney Corbeille, 24, one of the women tossed in the air, is making her theater debut in Bring It On. A cheerleader since age 6, Corbeille has studied ballet even longer.  \"My ballet teacher just about died when I first told her I was going to start cheerleading,\" Corbeille says. \"She thought I'd get hurt, that my technique would suffer. But she came to see the show last night, and she left me a voice mail saying that it was spectacular.\"",

        "article": "From their earliest days, roller coasters have been designed to inspire awe (and an element of fear) among riders. Rob Decker, senior vice president of planning and design at Cedar Fair Entertainment, which operates 14 theme parks in the United States and Canada, tries to make sure that the roller coaster experience continues this tradition, while reinventing how theme parks can continue to attract visitors. “We have a broad group of guests,” Mr. Decker said. “We have roller coaster enthusiasts and our family audience, so we try to balance the two and create a great environment for everyone.”  Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Decker.  Q. How did you end up working at Cedar Fair?  A. I’m an architect and urban designer. I was working with architectural firms and had a good friend who said my kind of background would be good for theme and amusement park design. At the time, I said it doesn’t sound like much of a career path. That was 27 years ago. I worked as a consultant for 11 years at Universal, Six Flags and a few other parks. I’ve been at Cedar Fair now for 16 years.  You’ve set out to maintain Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, as a top destination park, working with the design team to build roller coasters like the GateKeeper, which has the tallest inversion of any coaster in the world. What has the feedback been like?  I think GateKeeper was a terrific opportunity to put a roller coaster right at the front gate of the park, just to be able to celebrate and say, “Hey, we are the roller coaster capital of the world.” We were able to create these great towers that have slotted openings of about 100 feet. The ride threads the needle, does a full rotation and then threads the needle again in a vertical position. Cedar Point sits on a peninsula that divides Lake Erie from the [Sandusky] Bay, and I wanted people to get that great sense of arrival when they see the landscape.  Growing up, what was your favorite roller coaster?  My favorite coaster was the Racer at Kings Island [near Cincinnati], which was built in 1972 when the park opened. At the time, the ride seemed really big; it’s 88 feet tall and goes about 53 miles per hour.  What is the most memorable thing a guest has said to you?  There was one particular guest that I would see almost every year, and not just in one park, but several parks. He would always say, “Gee, can’t you build a roller coaster that’s 1,000 feet tall and goes a zillion miles an hour?” I didn’t want to tell him that it just wouldn’t be commercially viable. This year, we opened Fury 325 at Carowinds [located partly in Charlotte, N.C., and partly in Fort Mill, S.C.], and sure enough, he’s there. He said, “You know, you’re getting better at this.”  A few years ago, Cedar Fair expanded their Camp Snoopy and Planet Snoopy children’s ride areas. What have been some of the results?  Our focus more recently has not just been on rides for kids, but rides that parents and grandparents can ride alongside kids. Our goal is to make sure that families are having fun together, instead of parents waiting by the rail for their kids to get off the rides. Your parents are more likely to take you to a place where they had fun as a kid.  Is there an existing non-Cedar Fair roller coaster that you admire?  One ride that has been a really strong influence is Men in Black: Alien Attack at Universal Studios Florida, which opened in 2000. Technically, it’s not a coaster, but a dark ride on a track, and it’s fully immersive in the whole “Men in Black” story.  What advice do you have for kids who see your position as their dream career?  I tell kids three things: education, exploration and experience. I encourage them to study hard in school, particularly in math, science and engineering. We’re a partner with K’nex, and they have a competition where I judge coaster designs, and it’s really rewarding to see so much interest in what we do.

        "article": "BRUSSELS - European governments declared Friday that Moammar Gaddafi can no longer be considered the leader of Libya and must step down immediately, but they stopped short of formally recognizing the Libyan rebel movement or endorsing military action to support its armed struggle.  The cautious steps, at an emergency European Union summit, represented a setback for President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who had pushed for a bold stand that would put Europe more actively on the rebel side and encourage its ragtag fighters as they seek to beat back advancing counterattacks by Gaddafi's military.  To some extent, Sarkozy was joined by Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain in demanding a muscular stand and support for military preparedness. The two leaders had sent a letter to their E.U. colleagues Thursday appealing for a \"clear political signal\" from the summit. What emerged with the most clarity, however, was that a majority of the 27-nation European group, although sympathetic to the rebellion, was uncertain what steps to take to help the fight against Gaddafi.  After a day-long debate, the European leaders decided to qualify the rebel movement as a \"political interlocutor\" in Libya that they \"welcome and encourage\" in the battles under way in several Libyan cities. This fell well short of Sarkozy's proposal that the European Union join France in recognizing the Benghazi-based Libyan National Council as the country's legitimate representative.  The Europeans also endorsed contingency planning for \"all necessary options,\" including the military options under study by NATO allies. But they declined to specify what actions they favored and underlined that any such moves would have to be shown to be necessary, have a legal basis and be endorsed by regional governments.  The continent's caution was similar to that displayed by the Obama administration in Washington. In fact, its language on the conditions for military action was taken from White House statements and NATO deliberations on the other side of Brussels.  On both sides of the Atlantic, leaders were waiting to see what comes of an Arab League meeting Saturday in Cairo and consultations underway at U.N. headquarters in New York for a possible Security Council resolution.  France has advocated robust planning for military operations, if necessary and if the Security Council approves. Sarkozy, explaining the E.U. stand, said what he and the other leaders have in mind as the trigger for any military operation is large-scale use of Gadaffi's military aircraft against civilian populations.  \"What would people have said if Europe, even before thinking it over, had renounced all kinds of military action in Libya?\" he asked.  In more than three weeks of fighting, Gaddafi's air force has mounted repeated attacks against rebel forces and strategic targets such as ammunition dumps or oil facilities. But no massive strikes have been reported so far against civilians.  A no-fly zone, one of the proposals most discussed, is not a practical solution because of its complexity in a large, desert country, Sarkozy said. And, he added, NATO is not the right group to consider solutions to the Libyan crisis because it is a military organization widely untrusted in the Arab world.  Several nations have hesitated at the prospect of military action. Russia and China, both permanent Security Council members with veto power, have indicated they would find it hard to support any foreign military intervention in Libya's crisis.",

With the Lions circling the drain, it’s only a matter of time before Jim Caldwell is given his pink slip. When that happens, expect Teryl Austin to be first in line to fill the vacancy. In his first year with the Lions in 2014, Austin was responsible for second best total defense in the league. Losing Ndamukong Suh set Austin’s unit back, way back, but that was to be expected. Take into account that Austin has been a part of two Super Bowl teams, the 2009 Arizona Cardinals and the Super Bowl-winning 2012 Baltimore Ravens, and the Lions would appear to have their next head coach already on the sidelines.  The Bengals are enjoying an incredible start to the 2015 season and Jackson’s sixth-ranked offense is largely to thank. In his second year as offensive coordinator, Jackson has Andy Dalton pacing towards career highs in almost every category. If the Bengals are finally able to bust through their one-and-done history in the playoffs, expect Jackson to be highly sought after in the offseason.  Turner has been alternating between head coach and offensive coordinator jobs for the better part of 20 years. After a brief stop as the Browns’ OC in 2013, Turner has settled into the coordinator position for the Minnesota Vikings and turned Teddy Bridgewater into something of a revelation while getting the most out of 30-year-old Adrian Peterson. If history has a tendency to repeat itself, and in Turner’s case it does, he will be heading for a head coaching job very soon.  Haley is my favorite coach who looks like he’s seen a lot of Springsteen concerts. His dismal time as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs has been largely forgotten thanks to the prolific offense he’s installed with Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh. Haley has a tough, fiery personality that is inspiring when his team is winning. As we saw in Kansas City, it’s not quite so endearing under losing circumstances. But if he’s able to inspire change in a dejected franchise, it’s easy to imagine Haley’s style being celebrated.  McDaniels was not ready to be a head coach at 33-years-old in 2009. The Broncos were having an identity crisis and McDaniels wasn’t the coach to settle things in Denver. But six years later, McDaniels is flourishing under Bill Belichick with the New England Patriots for the second time in his career. The Patriots appear all but unstoppable on offense thanks to McDaniels. When quarterback Tom Brady decides it’s time to hang up his spikes, expect McDaniels to start looking for his second shot as a head coach, if not sooner.",

KABUL, Afghanistan — Three soldiers with the American-led coalition were killed and five were wounded Tuesday after a suicide car bomber struck their convoy at the gates of an American military base in Kabul, according to Afghan and American officials.  The attack took place just outside an American special operations forces base. There was no confirmation from the International Security Assistance Force about the nationalities of the victims.  On the same day, the Afghan interior minister confirmed in testimony before Parliament that the past six months had been the deadliest of the 13-year-long conflict with the Taliban, with 1,368 Afghan policemen killed and 2,370 wounded since March 21, the beginning of the current Afghan year. Police casualties have generally run at twice the level of Afghan Army casualties through much of the war.  The interior minister, Mohammad Omar Daudzai, also said the Taliban had carried out 700 attacks against the police during that period, and he blamed many of the assaults on foreign fighters joining with Taliban forces — a description commonly understood to mean Pakistani militants.  A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Sediq Sediqqi, said that 13 civilians were wounded in Tuesday’s attack, but none were killed. He also said 17 vehicles were damaged.  A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a post on Twitter, and praised the suicide bomber who carried it out. He later said in a statement that the civilian casualties were caused by glass shattering in car windows and were unintentional.  The attack took place near a crowded intersection, Massoud Circle, across from the American Embassy and in front of the military base, around 8 a.m., in the middle of rush hour when the area is usually very congested.

On Tuesday, the startup hub will announce its first international expansion, a 140,000 square-foot office in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam that could eventually house up to 500 companies. CIC’s founder and chief executuve, Tim Rowe, said the expansion is a natural — though big — step for an organization that prides itself on helping entrepreneurs with ideas to create products.  “We think, obviously, that innovation is a global phenomenon,” Rowe said. “We’re looking for ways to bridge across continents and connect innovation in Europe to innovation happening here. In this business one plus one is three.”  Rowe launched the company in 1999, and it has since become a key ingredient of the Cambridge startup scene. It now manages about 500,000 square feet of office space that it rents to some 800 companies, mostly startups and innovation units of big companies, but also to investors and related companies. Though it has seven locations, much of its operations are in Kendall Square. Two years ago, CIC launched its first out-of-town startup center, in St. Louis, and last year it opened one in downtown Boston. The center has been looking at locations in Europe for some time.  It chose the Netherlands, Rowe said, for the country’s strong startup culture and one of the highest entrepreneurship rates in Europe. Rotterdam is “the Boston” of the Netherlands, Rowe said, because it is near many of the nation’s best universities. It also has the cultural heritage of being Europe’s largest port, a trade hub, and the place from which many Europeans emigrated to the United States.  CIC is signing a 15-year lease in the Groot Handelsgebouw, a 1.1 million-square-foot former warehouse and iconic piece of Rotterdam’s postwar rebuilding effort. It’s now the country’s biggest business center, across from the city’s central rail station.  The project has been two years in the making, with Rowe and other CIC executives making many trips to the Netherlands to meet with university officials, business leaders, and even the king. CIC already has a managing director in place in Rotterdam and partnerships with universities and economic development groups. It has agreements with two large Dutch companies to rent space, though Rowe said he couldn’t yet name them, and is talking with a number of startups. CIC plans a soft opening this fall and an official grand opening in early 2016.  CIC’s expansion probably won’t stop there, Rowe said. He said he’s in “fairly advanced” talks about another startup hub in the United States, and “early” talks about other international locations.  “There’s kind of a renaissance of startup activity globally,” he said. “It’s just the right time for us to be doing this.”",

Its president, Steve Sabol, said recently that no player’s wiring had ever been as dramatic as Matthew Stafford’s in a comeback victory against the Browns.  The video, which has many memorable moments, culminates when Stafford, after sustaining a serious injury to his nonthrowing shoulder, eludes the trainers and runs back on the field for the final play. But words can’t do it justice; enjoy the clip.  A few bonus Web links:  With injuries to the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger and Charlie Batch, Dennis Dixon will go from No. 3 quarterback to No. 1 tonight. He is being thrown into the deep end of the pool: against the Ravens’ defense, at Baltimore:  The second-year man, while talented, has thrown just one NFL pass. Dixon, 24, hasn’t started a game since his senior year at the University of Oregon, and that came before a major knee injury ended his season and his Heisman Trophy candidacy.  Brian Schottenheimer on Rex Ryan’s decision to oversee all of the offense’s meetings. Andy McCullough, The Star-Ledger:  Of course, Brian Schottenheimer never wanted Rex Ryan to sit in on his meetings. Schottenheimer, the Jets offensive coordinator, wanted to operate without his head coach watching his every move.  “I think, early on, it stung me a little bit,” Schottenheimer said on Friday after practice at the Jets headquarters in Florham Park. “We have a goal everywhere I’ve ever been: You wanted to keep your head coach out of your meetings. That’s the goal.  “If you keep the head coach out of your meetings, then you’re doing a good job. Obviously, he needed to get involved.”  Rich Cimini of The Daily News said the Jets had Mark Sanchez practice throwing the ball away this past week. Ryan is apparently leaving nothing to chance; he has a plan to limit Sanchez’s interceptions.  The coach wouldn’t divulge the specifics, but the Daily News learned that it’s a simple red-yellow-green system, with each color telling Sanchez how cautious (red) or aggressive (green) he should be with a particular pass play.",

        "article": "(CNN) – Following the death of former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, a number of politicians have released statements on the iconic senator's death.  Read the statements, after the jump:  “A decorated World War II veteran, Senator Ted Stevens devoted his career to serving the people of Alaska and fighting for our men and women in uniform. Michelle and I extend our condolences to the entire Stevens family and to the families of those who perished alongside Senator Stevens in this terrible accident.”  Former President George W. Bush:  \" Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Ted Stevens and all those aboard the airplane that crashed in Alaska last night. Ted served our country with great distinction. We send our heartfelt condolences to the families of those who were lost, and we are praying for the health and well-being of the survivors.\"  Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:  \"We are saddened by the news of the plane crash that took the lives of our former colleague Senator Ted Stevens and four of his fellow passengers. Senator Stevens served our nation well, both in uniform and in the Senate, where he worked tirelessly for the people of Alaska for four decades. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, those who survived, and the rescue workers who risked their own lives to save them.\"  Former President George H.W. Bush:  Barbara and I mourn the tragic loss of Senator Ted Stevens, a respected friend of longstanding, and send our most sincere condolences to his family. Ted Stevens loved the Senate; he loved Alaska; and he loved his family — and he will be dearly missed.  Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin:  In 40 years of service in the U.S. Senate, he fought tenaciously for Alaska’s future. Alaskans know how much we owe to Senator Stevens, but all Americans owe him a debt of gratitude for his leadership on many issues, including the crucial energy issues that fuel American prosperity. Two years ago, he sat at my kitchen table over a salmon lunch, and we talked about our long anticipated Alaska natural gas pipeline and our mutual commitment to have the Last Frontier’s rich resources contribute to America’s quest for energy independence.  Our Senator was also known for spearheading efforts to ensure equality in education, and his Title IX legislation allowed girls to be on a level playing field in the athletic arena.  Our hearts and prayers are with the Stevens family and the families of the other victims of the crash.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:  “It is with deep sadness that Elaine and I note the passing of a friend and former colleague, Senator Ted Stevens. In the history of our country, no one man has done more for one state than Ted Stevens. His commitment to the people of Alaska and his nation spanned decades, and he left a lasting mark on both. From his early military service as a pilot in World War II, to his involvement in the statehood of “The Last Frontier,” to his fierce support and defense of our nation’s military, Ted Stevens was always there, fighting for what he believed in, and usually winning. He was a force to be reckoned with, and we will miss him greatly. We extend our deepest sympathies to Catherine and the entire Stevens family, and to the families of the friends who were lost in this terrible accident.\"  “The love and respect that Alaskans of all persuasions feel toward Ted Stevens is on a par with what the American people felt towards leaders such as John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ronald Reagan. Ted had the vision of a John Kennedy that Alaskans are an exceptional people who would achieve great things in his lifetime; the compassion of a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in devoting his life to alleviating the Third World conditions that plagued Alaska’s Native people; and the unwavering strength of a Ronald Reagan whether fighting for the men and women of our military or for Alaska’s right to develop ANWR and its abundant natural resources.  “On this sad and tragic day, we pray for all those who have perished, as well as the survivors and their families. I ask Alaskans to join me today in prayer.”  \"Our friendship was a very special one. When it came to policy, we disagreed more often than we agreed, but we were never disagreeable with one another. We were always positive and forthright. Senator Stevens and I worked together to ensure that the small non-contiguous states of Hawaii and Alaska were not forgotten by the lower 48 and to ensure that the nation awoke to the importance of the Pacific for our economy and international relations.  \"I will never forget him.  \"Ted Stevens was an extraordinary American. He risked his life while serving in China with the Flying Tigers in World War II. He was a leader in the Senate, having served as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate.  \"I have lost my brother.\"  Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Wisconsin Rep. David Obey:  “He devoted his life to the State of Alaska, which he dearly loved, and fought for it every day of his life with conviction and passion.  “My sympathy goes out to his family and the families of the others killed in this unfortunate accident.”",

        "article": "Mark Twain, who had arguably one of the sharpest tongues in literary history, is celebrated with a wide-angle Google Doodle on Wednesday showing Tom Sawyer and a young companion he's duped into whitewashing a picket fence.  Twain the rabble-rouser once wrote: \"Concerning the difference between man and the jackass: Some observers hold that there isn't any. But this wrongs the jackass.\" (Mark Twain's Notebook, 1898)  What else was this man, born 176 years ago today, besides a wicked wit? He was a heavy smoker -- lighting up 20 to 40 cigars a day, according to the Mark Twain Papers project at UC Berkeley. Also, he was a huge celebrity and \"a lover of music and song,\" according to the project. \"He was an enthusiastic inventor, an obsessive billiards player, a charismatic raconteur, a mischievous correspondent and perhaps the most sought-after luncheon and dinner guest in America.\"  PHOTOS: Mark Twain, and some of his best insults  Twain the inventor received three patents in the late 1880s: for an adjustable garment strap, a scrapbook with pre-gummed pages and an educational board game with historical dates and facts. Among his occupations was steamboat pilot in the Mississippi River at age 23, reporter and California prospector.  His life was touched by tragedy. There was a bankruptcy that nearly broke him, but he was especially affected by the deaths of two women. His 24-year-old daughter, adviser and confidante, Susy Clemens, died in 1896 of meningitis. And in 1904, his beloved wife, Livy, died after a lengthy illness.  A few weeks after his wife's death, he wrote: \"I cannot reproduce Livy's face in my mind's eye. I was never in my life able to reproduce a face. It is a curious infirmity — & now at last I realize it is a calamity.\"  A new century has brought new attention and appreciation for this amazing mind.  Last year, fans got a new dose of Twain with the publication of the first, unexpurgated volume of his autobiography. Two more volumes of the autobiography are in the wings. Previous versions of his autobiography were heavily edited by the original editor.  \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" turned 125 years old last year, but it may seem as fresh as if the tale were spun out yesterday on someone's MacBook. L.A. Times book critic David Ulin said that, with \"Finn,\" Twain \"invented a new kind of American language.\"  \"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called 'Huckleberry Finn,'\" Ernest Hemingway famously declared in 1935. \"It's the best book we've had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.\"  And just in time for Christmas: a two-CD set, “Mark Twain Words & Music.” It's the \"modern-day equivalent of a radio play,\" writes The Times' Randy Lewis. It combines Twain's words with songs delivered by artists including Emmylou Harris, Brad Paisley, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, Rhonda Vincent and Doyle Lawson. Garrison Keillor narrates, with Jimmy Buffett acting as the voice of Huck Finn. Clint Eastwood recites passages from Twain's autobiography.  Photos: Mark Twain's legacy in Hannibal, Mo.

        "article": "For the last three years, Neal Patel thought he was going to lose his mind from itching — suffering through a skin condition that made for miserable days and sleepless nights The 25-year-old medical student has been tortured by severe eczema on and off since childhood.  In the latest flare-up, which began during his second year at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, he stopped dating and going out with friends, embarrassed to be seen. Red scaly lesions erupted on his face, arms, hands, trunk and legs. His bed sheets were bloodied from picking at his skin for relief.  Until Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky, a rising star dermatologist and investigative researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center, came into his life.  Patel read about her groundbreaking research into atopic dermatitis, as eczema is medically known, and called to see if he could enroll in one of her ongoing clinical trials. “I am indebted to Dr. Guttman,” Patel said. “She has pretty much saved my life.”  Guttman-Yassky, 40, is in the forefront of major advances in the understanding and treatment of eczema. In her laboratory at Rockefeller University and now at Mount Sinai, she has identified the molecules that cause the inflammatory skin disease and targeted drugs to treat it.  She also discovered a unique lymphocyte “Th22” — and its possible role in atopic dermatitis.  “She really is changing the world,” said Dr. Mark Lebwohl, the chief of dermatology at Mount Sinai and president of the American Academy of Dermatology.  Until now, the common treatments for severe eczema were powerful systemic steroids, like prednisone, which can have terrible side effects, and cyclosporine, a broad immune-suppressing drug that turns off an entire immune system and can permanently damage the kidneys, increase blood pressure and increase cancers.  The new drugs Guttman-Yassky is testing target only a very small part of the immune system. If successful, they could be available to the public within a few years.  Guttman-Yassky’s interest in internal medicine and dermatology has been personal as well as professional. She herself had eczema as a child growing up in Romania and Israel.  Neal Patel stopped dating and going out after his latest eczema flare-up.  Eczema affects 30 million Americans, including 15% of the children in the U.S.  “The molecular maps or pathways that are activated in eczema had not been well defined,” Guttman-Yassky said. “It was not clear whether it was a disease of immune activation or if the outer layer of the skin was deficient. We now understand that the disease is primarily immune driven ... which makes it much easier to cure.”  Guttman-Yassky is the principal investigator in several crucial drug trials for patients with moderate to severe eczema — including one funded by the National Institutes of Health for $2.7 million.  “I think these drugs could be a revolutionary change for patients who have suffered for so long,” said Guttman-Yassky, who describes herself as a medical Sherlock Holmes.  Eczema affects 30 million Americans, including 15% of the children in the country. The good news is that most children will outgrow it by age 10 and many will outgrow it by age 5.  Patel, after just two weeks in the drug trial, is already seeing progress. “I am clearing up, I am itching less, I am sleeping better,” Patel said. “I haven’t felt this good in three years. I feel so lucky.”",

        "article": "Sep 23rd 2011, 7:39 by E.L.  ANYONE reading this blog will have some interest in Cold War espionage, so I thought it would be interesting to highlight the debate raging in Britain about the new film of \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" — John le Carré's masterly portrayal of betrayal in the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).  The Economist reviewer liked the film, calling it \"deliciously memorable\". But others are less complimentary. Roger Lewis in the Times ($) said it was \"absolutely terrible\". His chief beef was that not as good as the 1979 television adaptation featuring Alec Guinness. The FT called it \"bloodless, bloodthirsty\". But these were just mild pokes compared to the broadside in the Mail on Sunday from Peter Hitchens (disclosure: an old friend, and like me a near-obsessive fan of le Carré's earlier books). Under the headline \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Travesty\", he says the film is \"absolutely unforgivably awful\". First he highlights silly changes to the plot (why does Jim Prideaux get shot in Budapest rather than a Czech forest? Why transplant the Chelsea bibliophile Smiley to Hampstead and make him into a keen swimmer? He dislikes the casting. The Scot Percy Alleline (creepy and posh in the book) \"sounds and looks as if he has recently given up being a Glasgow bus conductor.\" Other accents are not nearly clipped enough. He objects to the way that Colin Firth (playing Bill Haydon) looks too plump and healthy to be part of the wartime generation.  I think these (and other well-spotted lacunae and errors) are fair criticisms, but not damning ones. It is remarkably hard for films to make modern actors look as if they are starving. Even the Polish officers in Andrzej Wajda's Katyń didn't look as if they had been anywhere near the Soviet Union in wartime. On the plus side, I think Gary Oldman is a stronger Smiley than Alec Guinness in one important respect: grit. Smiley was a British spy in Nazi Germany (under cover as the Swiss employee of a Swedish shipping firm). Those nervewracking years forged an inner steel that comes across clearly in the books, less so with the donnish, cuckolded Guinness of 1979.  Rather stronger is Peter's criticism of parts of the reworked plot's plausibility, which are in wilful contradiction of the book. He asks:  is it possible to believe that the director of the Secret Intelligence Service (at one point Cornwell says that he was so secretive that his own wife believed till the day he died that he worked for the National Coal Board) would have left his London flat full of charts and notes about a mole hunt in SIS, and that it would all still be there, untouched, months after his death?  I would agree with that. However as le Carré himself was closely involved in the film, and is a veteran of both MI6 and MI5, it would be rash for an outsider to be too definitive on what is and is not credible. Even today MI6 officers seem to have a habit of losing briefcases and believing the word of fraudsters and nutcases. Other bits of the film, such as an uproarious MI6 Christmas party, complete with a Lenin-like Santa Claus and a good rendition of the Soviet national anthem, are completely credible (even though they don't feature in the books).  My own beef with the film is a different one (as I write in my latest column in European Voice): \"We never get a feeling for why the whole business really matters.\" Spying, I argue, is indeed partly just a game, a swirling mix of intellectual challenge, office politics and national prestige. It is a fascinating world, which is why le Carré's books sell so well. And a dose of moral equivalence is inescapable. But:  in the era of George Smiley the Soviet Union was still a totalitarian empire. It had recently invaded Hungary and would soon invade Czechoslovakia. Vasily Grossman's epic novel “Life and fate”, which told the real story of wartime Stalinism, had just been ‘arrested' – the Soviet authorities said that it would be published only in a few centuries' time (an excellent radio dramatisation is now available on the BBC website). It was a world of political prisoners, captive nations, merciless pressure on the brave and shameful collaboration.  The Cold War was also a struggle in which victory seemed anything but assured. The Soviet Union was able to devote colossal resources to armaments and subversion. Nowadays, it seems obvious that planned economies do not work and that one-party states are too brittle to survive. But that is with hindsight. At the time, the Soviet ability to penetrate, divide and weaken the West was terrifying.  It is against that background that the spy wars were fought. They were not just about the jealousies of office life, the desire for national prestige, or the adrenalin buzz of undercover operations. They were about life and death – of agents, intelligence officers and democracy itself. It is easy to sniff about this now – and le Carré himself in his later books has accentuated the cynicism and flaws of the spy world. But at the time it mattered. That is why people like Oleg Gordievsky, British intelligence's top source in the KGB, risked their lives to help the West. That is why the people betrayed by Aldrich Ames, the KGB man in the CIA, got shot.  The moral and geopolitical drama does not come across sufficiently (at least for me) in “Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy”. The traitor, once confronted, explains his motivation by saying only that he had to choose a side and that the West was “ugly”. Well, so it was, but in comparison the Soviet bloc was outright hideous. Watch “Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy”. But listen to Grossman.",

        "article": "BY GEORGE RUSH AND JOANNA MOLLOY With Kasia Andersonand Sari Botton  Sunday, June 16th 2002, 1:80AM  Prince Albert of Monaco wants to give New York a living gift to remember the 2,823 people who died at the World Trade Center.  The prince, along with other Monegasques and several Americans living in Monte Carlo, want to donate a tree for each life lost.  \"Nothing will replace the lives of those people,\" Prince Albert's spokesman Armande Deus told us the other day. \"But it will be great to keep their memo-ries alive through trees.\"  The greenery could be made available to a memorial built on the site, and might even be spread throughout the city, a Parks Department source told us.  But officially, a spokesman for Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe would not comment, nor would anyone from the Parks Department.  \"Everyone in Monaco was concerned about the tragedy,\" Deus continued. \"And Prince Albert certainly was. Of course, his mother was Princess Grace, and that makes him half American. The Princess Grace Foundation is in New York.\"  The cost of landscaping, the saplings themselves and perhaps small memorial plaques could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Still, Deus said, \"I just spoke with the prince, and hopefully it will be transformed into a project. Right now it is just an idea, but a wonderful idea that the prince has had.\"  Then again, said Deus, \"New York has 1,000 ideas. Make that 10,000.\"  Libby Pataki gushed like a teenager at the Andrea Bocelli concert in Madison Square Garden the other night.  \"I see him everywhere I can - here, in Florida,\" she said, practically swooning. \"I have every one of his CDs.\"  She wasn't alone. \"Most people can't draw flies,\" said Donald Trump. \"He's drawn 20,000 people here tonight.\"  So enraptured were the tenor's devotees - Isabella Rossellini and Empire State Development Corp. Chairman Charles Gargano carried roses up to the stage. Bocelli gave three encores, and even sang \"My Way.\"  \"I sense that New York is 'up' now,\" the 45-year-old singer told us backstage. \"New York has begun to live again, and that is because the people here have moved forward strongly, with courage.\"  Courage is something Bocelli knows about. Born with glaucoma and blinded at 12, he put himself through law school singing in piano bars. Now, his CDs from \"Romanza\" to \"Cieli di Toscana\" have sold 20 million copies.  Asked how the 6-foot-2 hunk feels about Internet fan sites where women endlessly debate his hair and beard length, Bocelli said with a wry smile: \"They only see me on a small video and they think I am physically attractive. They are mistaken.\"  Criticized by opera elitists in the past, Bocelli's voice seemed improved. Had personal sadness - the death of his father and separation from wife Enrica - deepened his technique?  \"All good singers show the life inside. When I will not be able to put that into my singing, I will stop.\"  Ralph Fiennes is doing his best to unlink himself from Jennifer Lopez. The actor said in a statement that word of a romance with his co-star on \"Uptown Girl\" is \"a load of rubbish. There is no truth in it whatsoever.\"  Still, Lopez made no secret of her admiration for the \"English Patient\" Oscar nominee. \"I find him very sweet,\" she told us at the recent premiere of her movie \"Enough,\" moments after Fiennes had kissed her goodbye.  The Bronx-born homegirl said the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate is \"very English.\" But, she added, \"I've traveled a lot. I'm used to it. And it's not like you can't joke with him. He's not uptight. He's pretty cool.\"  Fiennes' lady love, Francesca Annis, would surely agree.  A fender bender prevented Billy Joel from showing up at the Songwriters Hall of Fame dinner Thursday.  \"He was driving in the rain down a slippery road in Sag Harbor and his car swerved and hit a pole,\" said Joel's spokeswoman. \"Nobody else was hurt, but his face was bruised and swollen on one side, so he decided not to go. He was extremely disappointed to miss it.\"  Also not at the New York Sheraton ceremony was Michael Jackson, who stayed in London and sent Liza Minnelli to pick up his award. Among those who did show were Sting (performing a jazzy version of \"Roxanne\"), Stevie Wonder (who won the longest standing ovation), Randy Newman (who said he still \"hates\" songwriting) and Brian McKnight (who told us backstage, \"I'm looking for some hot chicks\").  Jay-Z is pressing on with his search for the perfect pad. Last month, the rapper bailed out of a $6.5 million deal to buy a 9,000-square-foot Tribeca penthouse - prompting the seller, ad guru Peter Arnell, to sue two neighbors for allegedy spreading fear that Jay-Z would bring danger to the building.  The hip-hop king is hoping condo owners at the Briarcliff on W. 57th St. will be more open-minded. On Friday, he inspected the 8,000-square-foot penthouse that real-estate mogul Andrew Farkas has on the market for $7 million. Stay tuned.  Designer Cynthia Rowley and her husband, Bill Keenan, have parted company.  Rowley, whose first husband died of cancer, married Keenan, an artist and architect, in 1996 in a City Hall ceremony officiated by then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The couple collaborated on Rowley's fashion shows, her store in Japan - and daughter, Kit, who turns 3 next month.  A friend of Rowley tells us she and Keenan \"are still friendly. The marriage just didn't work out.\"  Private eye Bo Dietl and businessman William Fugazy need a consigliere. The other night, when the National Italian American Foundation honored Rao's restaurateur Frank  Pelligrino, Dietl declared that Pelligrino should be proud, because \"this is a real organization, as opposed to the one Fugazy runs.\"  Dietl told us that even though Fugazy's National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations presented him with its Ellis Island Medal, \"It's a phony award. Anybody can have one if they pay enough.\"  \"I'm shocked by the comment,\" said Fugazy.  A pal of Fugazy, who received a pardon from Bill Clinton in January 2001, thinks Dietl is still steamed because he didn't like the table he got at a Fugazy-organized tribute to Rudy Giuliani last year.  Whatever. Dietl, who spearheaded security at the U.S. Open golf tourney, is taking nothing back.  IS ELIZABETH Hurley ready to let Steve Bing off the hook? A well-placed source says Hurley is resisting taking part in a DNA test that would prove the movie producer is the father of her son, Damian. Hurley's rep insists, \"Elizabeth is happy to take part in the DNA test and provide DNA from Damian.\" Whatever. Dennis Miller had to laugh about the baby drama the other night at the AFI tribute to Tom Hanks. \"Like many of you,\" Miller told the Hollywood audience, \"I'm a tad nervous about coming into L.A. and falling head over heels for Steve Bing\"  SUGE KNIGHT is doing his part for dads behind bars. The hip-hop honcho has chartered buses to bring wives and children to visit their husbands and fathers at California's federal and state prisons today. Knight was released last August after serving five years on assault charges. \"Fathers who are incarcerated realize that the mother and children are doing the same time in their hearts,\" says Tha Row's CEO  THE L.A. Lakers may have won another NBA trophy, but owner Jerry Buss still has his priorities. The team talked about having its celebration at the Ritz-Carlton. But a source tells us that when the hotel informed Buss the party would cost $59,000, he decided to have it at Mickey Mantle's. A Laker rep says the team chose the Central Park South restaurant \"for several reasons, price being one of them\"  MICHAEL SALEM, whose mail-order firm for transvestites provided the high heels Rudy Giuliani wore when he danced with the Rockettes, is also a dogged detective. Fifteeen years ago, Salem's friend and aide Christopher O'Connor, 22, was murdered outside a Queens nightclub. Salem says he's spent $150,000 to find who killed him. He's hired private investigators and consulted with medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden to trawl for leads. \"I will never give up,\" says Salem  B. SMITH, restaurateur, will be honored by the YWCA at the National Arts Club's Wednesday auction featuring contributions from Laurence Rockefeller, Hartley DuPont, Nicole Miller, Matthew David, James Eisdorfer, Heidi Albertsen, Howard Sobel and Grace Hightower.",

It's not just a fashion statement. And it's not a mistake. In fact, the reason has a bittersweet backstory and is a touching little March Madness subplot for college hoops fans just now seeing the Blazers play for the first time.  UAB coach Jerod Haase took over the Blazers program in 2012. During his first season, according to the school's official athletic site, the team became close with a young cancer survivor named Elijah Seritt. He and his family remain friends of the program.  Elijah went through two brain surgeries, 17 surgeries overall, two stem-cell transplants and chemotherapy to rid his body of medulloblastoma, a form of brain cancer.  This summer, Haase and the Blazers took an off-season trip to Spain to play games against European competition in hopes of priming them for year to come. Haase saw a player on a Spanish team wearing mismatched sneakers, according to UABsports.com, and came up with an idea: If his team pulled a similar stunt this year, perhaps people would wonder what the deal was. The team could use the attention to help raise awareness and money for pediatric cancer treatment and research.  “We wanted to do something to recognize Elijah’s courageous battle and his role on our team,” Haase told the UAB site in November as the 2014-15 season got underway. “We immediately thought wearing two different colors of shoes would cause fans to ask why and give us a perfect opportunity to raise awareness for pediatric cancer.”  The team has worn different colored Nikes since the start of this season. Interested parties are asked to consider making a donation to Children's of Alabama, where Elijah was treated for his brain cancer.  UAB pulled off the tourney's first upset in the game, beating popular dark-horse Final Four pick Iowa State 60-59. Somewhere, Elijah and his family must have been very, very happy.",

        "article": "FORTUNE – Prices for gold, silver, and other commodities might have tumbled Monday, but don’t bet that investors are feeling much safer now that Osama bin Laden has been killed.  For months, the value of precious metals and oil has surged partly on worries over everything from America’s growing deficit to ongoing unrest in the Middle East. Certainly these problems won’t be going away any time soon, even if oil prices fell by as much as 2.7% (the most in two weeks) to $110.83 a barrel, while gold dropped to nearly $1,540 an ounce from its fresh record high of $1.575.79, and silver plunged 10%. Prices of all three commodities erased much of those losses by the end of the day Monday.  Any downward pressure on oil and precious metals will likely will be short-lived. In general, investors turn to gold and silver as safe-haven investments away from U.S. Treasuries and other securities. Prices for the commodities have been rallying as policymakers on Capitol Hill wrangle over huge fiscal deficit problems.  At least as a knee-jerk reaction, it might make sense for investors to trade on expectations that the death of Osama bin Laden will eventually reduce military spending by the U.S. Department of Defense. But that argument will probably wane, as key drivers that have supported prices are unlikely to fundamentally change.  So far this year, oil markets have rallied as civil war in Libya and anti-government protests in the Gulf broke out. And while ultra-loose monetary policy has also helped send oil and gold prices higher, it’s unlikely that bin Laden’s death will change the direction of interest rates any time soon. Last month, the Fed announced it planned to keep rates low for an extended period to support the economic recovery.  To be sure, the death of one of the world’s most notorious terrorist group leaders clearly sends a signal to other like-minded groups, but it’s not as if the world is all safe and sound. Already, some analysts are expecting bin Laden’s death to provoke unrest in key oil exporting nations such as Saudi Arabia.  “While US equity future are trading higher, security threats may actually create an increase in global market uncertainty,” according to a UBS report Monday.  Vedant Mimani, lead portfolio manager of Ayant Capital, says the fall in oil and precious metals is merely a “short-term emotional one.” Europe’s huge debt problems, which have unnerved investors and driven many to invest more in precious metals, is likely to persist for a while.  “The real driver behind gold is supply,” says Mimani, who was buying up gold at a discount when markets opened Monday morning. His firm manages $21 million spanning two funds that include Indian equities and precious metals.  Turns out that was a wise trade. Gold has more than recovered Monday, rising to a record $1,577.40 an ounce. So much for the party.",

        "article": "Sylvester Clement had been swinging his machete to clear the dense bamboo blocking our trail when he turned his attention to an overgrown area to our left. A few moments later he revealed a rusting Japanese tank – a hidden relic of World War II. “I found this here two weeks ago,” he said. “You’re the second person to see it.”  It is not surprising that the tank remained undiscovered for so long. Floating in the Pacific Ocean about midway between Hawaii and Australia, the Marshall Islands was recently listed as one of the five least visited countries in the world, with only 5,000 annual visitors. The international airport in the low-key capital Majuro is served by an irregular and expensive United Airlines “island-hopper” flight that makes a slow journey from Honolulu and Guam. The islands are also feeling the severe effects of climate change, with rising sea levels meaning that the Marshall Islands residents may become the world’s first climate change refugees in the coming decades. But for those who make it here now, the 29 atolls and thousands of low-lying islets of the Marshall Islands offer a fascinating insight into remote island life.  The fact that a young man like Clement had a job taking care of tourists is a rarity in the Marshall Islands, where the illusion of an island paradise is quickly revealed to be skin deep. After several decades of Japanese rule, the Marshall Islands fell under American control in 1945, at the end of World War II. It was on Bikini, one of the northern atolls, that the US military detonated 67 nuclear bombs between 1946 and 1958 as part of the atomic weapon test programme. The residents of Bikini and nearby atolls were evacuated, and tightly knit communities were squeezed onto already crowded islands that were ill equipped to deal with newcomers. Those atolls remain uninhabited even today, with residual radiation levels rendering long-term consumption of locally grown food hazardous to human health.  Although the Marshall Islands achieved independence in 1986, their economy remains heavily dependent on the US as part of the Compact of Free Association relationship, which ensures financial assistance in exchange for full US military authority. Natural resources on the overcrowded islands are inadequate and a large part of the population lives in poverty, while a diet of mostly processed food has led to high rates of obesity and diabetes. Unemployment is endemic, with more than 50% of people out of work and relying on the government for basic support. With very little industry and few commercial links to the outside world, there are not many prospects for young people – although tourism could help.  “We have the biggest shark sanctuary in the world. We have pristine lagoons, perfect atolls; we have great diving and surfing,” said Ramsay Reimers, owner of one of Majuro’s few hotels. “The biggest problem is the skill shortage. We have to get what we need from outside. Our doctors come from the Philippines, our nurses from Fiji.”  It was during a visit to Reimers’ private island of Eneko, which is open to locals and hotel guests, that I was taken for a walk by Clement. His job is to look after guests who come to the island on a day-trip from Majuro or choose to stay in one of the island’s three bungalows. Clement is a graduate of Waan Aelõñ in Majel (WAM), a not-for-profit organisation on Majuro set up by local boat-builder and social entrepreneur Alson Kelen in 2000, that helps young Marshallese with both vocational training and life skills.  The idea for WAM started when Kelen saw that one of the island’s most distinctive traditions – building the Marshallese canoes that for centuries had sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific to islands as far away as Hawaii with which they traded – had nearly been lost. The knowledge of older islanders was not being taken up by the younger generation.  “I thought to myself, instead of keeping written archives of Marshallese canoes, why not create a living record?” he said. At the same time, Kelen saw that children were dropping out of school and teenage pregnancy rates continued to climb. By offering a practical course that preserved local traditions, he could also help curb some of the islands’ endemic problems.",

        "article": "Now exactly 40 years since the first commercial flight by Concorde, the supersonic aircraft is beloved by aircraft enthusiasts worldwide but it's likely that some of those first passengers flying from London to Bahrain on January 21, 1976, felt a sense of trepidation. As the first customers on board Concorde’s inaugural commercial flight, they were about to travel at speeds that were completely beyond the norm for recreational travellers. Though the aircraft they were travelling on had broken the sound barrier for the first time just over six years earlier and had been subjected to the longest engine test in history before being allowed to accept them on board, their flight was the subject of discussion worldwide.  Despite the international interest, the journey was completed without incident and Concorde aircraft, operated by British Airways and Air France, continued to fly until it was withdrawn from service on October 24, 2003. In that time more than 2.5million passengers travelled by Concorde, with BA alone having operated 50,000 Concorde flights. For the British carrier, the most popular route was between London Heathrow and New York JFK. The journey, which would take more than seven hours on a Boeing 747, took just three hours and 20 minutes. With Concorde it was possible to fly to London from New York in less time than it takes to travel by train from the capital to Edinburgh.  For the privileged few who had the opportunity to fly on Concorde, the experience was one to remember. The aircraft would typically reach an altitude of over 50,000ft and from its top cruising height of 60,000ft – more than 11 miles high - those on board could see the curvature of the earth. Another benefit of flying at such high altitude was that the chances of encountering turbulence were diminished.  During the flight itself vintage champagnes were served and gourmet dishes were presented on Royal Doulton bone china. A menu from a 1989 flight from London to Washington allowed passengers to choose from foie gras mousse and caviar and sour cream barquette to start; mains included prime fillet of beef or crayfish tails garnished with sautéed pimento; a more restrained dessert was limited to a crème brulee or assorted cheeses. Personal attention was assured, with one member crew attending to every nine passengers.  Joan Collins travelled by Concorde so frequently that she became something of an ambassador for the service, but other celebrities’ usage of the service also consolidated its glamorous, decadent reputation. In 1985 Phil Collins, who, lest we forget, was very popular then, used Concorde to get from the Live Aid concert in London to the one in Philadelphia, playing both in one day. Other frequent passengers included the Queen, Elton John, Mick Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor and Sean Connery; Diana Ross was arrested before boarding the aircraft, having assaulted a security officer who had attempted to search her.  The allure of Concorde remained intact until July 2000, when the aircraft crashed just after take-off in Paris and all 109 people on board, and four on the ground, were killed. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the market for the service was reduced further and the decision was made to cancel it completely in 2003.  BA is resolute in its decision that the aircraft is permanently grounded and the limited number of passengers who had the opportunity to fly Concorde remain part of an exclusive, and closed, club, but there's a glimmer of hope for travellers who would like to fly aboard the aircraft in future. A number of groups have petitioned British Airways to recommence Concorde flights and, one, Club Concorde, now believes it has adequate financial backing and technical expertise to independently place a Concorde plane on permanent display on London's South Bank by 2017 and to return the supersonic aircraft to service by 2019.

(Google Maps)  A former fly-in fly-out worker who repeatedly stabbed a man who had a threesome with his girlfriend has been found guilty of murder.  Ryan Christopher Hawke has for the past 11 days been on trial in the West Australian Supreme Court, charged with murdering Mark Koller, 50, at the Crystal Brook Caravan Park in Orange Grove in April last year.  Hawke, 34, admitted stabbing Mr Koller but claimed he expected the confrontation would only be a fist fight and brought a knife with him to defend himself.  The court heard Mr Koller was stabbed six times, four times in the chest and twice in the back.  One witness testified that she saw an armed Hawke drive up in a car with a woman and bang on a caravan, angrily shouting: \"Get out here! I'm going to kill you!\"  She said Mr Koller put both hands up, \"trying to calm the young man down\", and only became more aggressive when he was threatened.  Another witness testified that Mr Koller jumped up and down like he was doing a \"war dance\" with his fists up.  Hawke said \"I'm sorry\" as he was led out of the courtroom.  He will be sentenced on September 30.  Do you have any news photos or videos?",

IFF beat consensus earnings estimates by 5 percent, a strong result given the company is facing foreign-exchange headwinds and volatile customer ordering patterns.  IFF's shares reached a fresh high on Tuesday and have roughly doubled in the past five years.  IFF's bite-size acquisitions of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and Henry H Ottens Manufacturing, both in 2015, weren't overly exciting for dealmakers whose fees are tied to a transaction's size. But they have been a success, boosting the company's fragrances segment and flavors segment sales by 4 percent, respectively (on a currency-neutral basis) and lifting its overall adjusted Ebitda margin by 120 basis points to a respectable 24.7 percent this quarter. The acquisitions also keep IFF on track to meet at least one of its four \"Vision 2020\" goals of strengthening and expanding its portfolio.  IFF's adjusted Ebitda margin has expanded by 480 basis points in the past four years  Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig shed additional light Tuesday on what IFF is looking for in potential takeover targets, namely businesses that either offer technology and innovation, or access to customers in regions in which it's currently underrepresented. Active cosmetics -- ingredients that can be used in products that tackle skin aging and protection -- is a division that the company hopes to grow both via M&A and organically, he said.  \"As you know, we are not doing anything outrageous here. We really want to make sure that we are financially disciplined [around] what we acquire,\" Fibig said on the company' s earnings call. Transactions must be accretive to earnings per share in the first year following a deal, and boost economic profit within three to five years, said IFF's CFO Alison Cornell.  At least one private equity-backed business may be a fit -- specialty chemical company CABB, which makes ingredients used in cosmetics, vitamins, agrichemicals and other products. But it's unclear whether its owner Permira is a willing seller, considering the firm has owned CABB for less than two years.  One potential hurdle for IFF comes in the form of key rivals . Germany's Symrise and Switzerland's Givaudan appear to be equally as focused on so-called bolt-on acquisitions, which may intensify competition for any potential deals.  IFF's soaring shares are already viewed as fully valued by Wall Street analysts who believe the stock will be trading at roughly the same level 12 months from now. But a dash of M&A action -- within the company's outlined boundaries -- may prop them higher yet.

Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, the Vatican's foreign minister, spoke in the wake of attacks against Christians in India that have left at least 13 people dead this week.  Vatican Foreign Minister Archbishop Dominique Mamberti warned of a rise in what he called \"Christianophobia.\"  Mamberti, addressing a conference in northern Italy, said religious freedom was a vital part of international relations and human dignity.  \"In order to promote this dignity in an integral way, so-called 'Christianophobia' should be combated as decisively as 'Islamophobia' and anti-Semitism,\" he said.  This week in eastern India, thousands of people, most of them Christians, have sought shelter in makeshift government camps, driven from their homes by religious violence.  Hindu mobs burnt more than a dozen churches and attacked Christians after a Hindu leader was killed.  Mamberti said the events in India made the issue of religious liberty today all the more pressing.  While Hindu groups accuse Christian priests of bribing poor tribes and low-caste Hindus to change their faith, the Christians say lower-caste Hindus convert willingly to escape a complex caste system.  Pope Benedict has condemned the violence against Christians in Orissa but also deplored the killing of the Hindu leader.  Italy's foreign ministry said it would summon India's ambassador to demand \"incisive action\" to prevent further attacks against Christians.  Mamberti said 21 Catholic missionaries were killed in the world in 2007 and lamented that the Christian population of Iraq was now down to about 500,000 from about one million before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.  Last month, Pope Benedict told Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that minority Christians in Iraq needed more protection.  The Archbishop of Mosul of Iraq's largest Christian denomination, the Chaldean Catholics, was kidnapped in February and found dead two weeks later.  The Vatican has often expressed concern that conflicts in the Middle East are greatly diminishing the Christian population in the areas of the religion's birth.",

        "article": "SAN DIEGO - The open slit across the bridge of his nose recalls a fighter's scar, which seems apropos, as I'm here to nominate Darren Sproles for a pound-for-pound title. He may not be the NFL's best, but he gets my vote for toughest.  \"Oh, that,\" he says, touching the wound as if to remember. \"Two days ago in practice. The helmet came down on my nose.\"  It's not the biggest cut. But the horizontal half-inch thread gives you a pretty good idea of the impact. Doesn't take much to imagine a man twice Sproles' size coming down on him, like a building collapsing.  \"It was an inside run,\" he says.  \"You're too small to run inside.\"  \"Nah,\" he says, smiling. \"Not really.\"  At 5-foot-6, the Chargers' all-purpose back is the shortest man on an NFL roster, according to STATS LLC. For the record, there is another 5-6 player, Cory Ross, a little-used back with the Ravens. But he's listed at 201 pounds. For the purposes of comparison, a better-known little guy, Maurice Jones-Drew, is 5-7 and goes 208. Sproles is 185.  Still, that's not the main criterion in my pound-for-pound argument. I happened to be at Qualcomm Stadium for Sproles' best night in professional football. That was last January, when he gained 328 all-purpose yards (including 22 on the winning touchdown in overtime) while filling in for an injured LaDainian Tomlinson in a playoff win against the Colts. But the real tough guy didn't emerge until after the game, when Sproles was asked to appear in the interview room.  I didn't know it at the time, but Sproles has a stuttering problem. It came on when he was five or six years old, and never went away. But he deals with it. And never better than that night.  Truth is, he thought about not showing up in the interview room. One-on-one interviews are OK; he chooses his words with deliberation. It's refreshing to hear. Sports are afflicted with an epidemic of glib, with guys who keep talking but say nothing. (You hear me, Ocho?) Yet here's a man who chooses his words to matter, who works to use language with meaning.  \"When I get a camera in my face, though,\" says Sproles, \"that's when I get real nervous.\"  The post-playoff interview room was his nightmare: hot, crowded and full of cameras. It was a small space as I remember, maybe 30 or 40 reporters and cameramen.  \"But when I walked out there, it looked like, man, about 500 people,\" recalls Sproles.  He remembered what his teammates had said in urging him to the room.  Don't worry. Just go in and talk.You stutter, you stutter.Ain't no big deal.  And he remembered his own training: Just breathe. Relax. Take my time.  Then he went to the podium and answered every last question, and did a pretty good job of it.  Talking to Sproles at training camp on Thursday, I'm sure he wanted to walk away from the interview room. But I don't think he ever really would have. He had trained in anticipation of just that moment, working hard to deal with the stutter. Walking away would've been like walking away from a fight. And Sproles, who works with the Stuttering Foundation of America, isn't the type to do that.  He says he'd rather have kids watch tape of that press conference than the 328-yard game.  \"Sometimes, kids be scared to talk in front of the class,\" he says. \"I just want to show them. You don't have to be scared to talk.\"  Even as I write this, there are those of you looking up Sproles' stats, unimpressed. He had just 330 regular-season rushing yards and another 342 receiving while backing up Tomlinson last year. Upon closer inspection, however, you'll see an average of 5.4 yards per carry. Of his 29 catches, an astounding five went for touchdowns. He got two more touchdowns on returns, and averaged better than 27 yards on kickoffs. Then there's one more number: $6.6 million. That's how much he'll earn this year after the Chargers designated him a franchise player.  So, not only is Sproles one of the toughest guys in the league, he's also pound-for-pound among the richest.  \"It's very gratifying when players do exactly what you envisioned them doing,\" said A.J. Smith, the Chargers general manager, who scouted Sproles and drafted him out of Kansas State. \"He's skilled in so many areas.\"  He can run. He can catch passes. He returns punts and kickoffs. To Smith, he's the antithesis of the \"boisterous, bragging\" character who declares, \"I've been in the league a year and a half, I'm ready to be The Guy.\"  Sproles doesn't need to talk about being The Guy. He's a man.  For the record, he said he'd be happy with \"15 touches\" a game, any combination of runs, returns and passes. But he could do 20, or even 25 if need be. Does that make him an every-down back, a so-called featured player?  \"That makes him a special player who can help the Chargers win,\" says Smith. \"That (franchise) tag tells you all you need to know.\"  It was a hard-won $6.6 million. In 2004, he lost his mother to cancer. He had promised her he would graduate, and so he did the next year, with a degree in speech pathology. Still, there were no shortage of presumptions against a rookie who came into his first camp at 5-6, 180 pounds. In 2006, he broke his ankle in an exhibition game and missed the season. Most guys don't come back from broken ankles, especially players who depend on changing directions at high speeds.  The ankle, it's worth mentioning, was snapped on a punt return. Returns are the most hazardous plays. You hear of so many career-ending injuries, of guys being knocked silly.  I ask Sproles what's the hardest he's ever been hit.  \"In college,\" he says. \"Against Oklahoma State.\" He doesn't remember who hit him. But there were two of them. One from his left, another from the right. He didn't see either.  \"Were you knocked out?\" I ask, again looking at the fighter's cut.  He shakes his head. \"Just got up slow.\"  \"Nah,\" says Darren Sproles. \"Never.\"",

        "article": "US rappers Big Boi, TI and Killer Mike have backed a court case they are hoping will land in the US supreme court as part of a broader effort to curb the criminalization of rap music.  Taylor Bell, who performs under the name T-Bizzle, was suspended from his Mississippi high school in January 2011 after writing a song about female students’ claims that they had been harassed by two school coaches.  Itawamba school officials interpreted the lyrics as a literal threat after Bell posted the song, PSK da Truth, on Facebook and YouTube, with him rapping lyrics such as: “Looking down girls’ shirts / Drool running down your mouth / You fucking with the wrong one / Going to get a pistol down your mouth.”  Erik Nielson, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond who studies hip-hop, said that while it’s largely accepted that Bob Marley never actually shot a sheriff and that Johnny Cash didn’t shoot a man in Reno, hip-hop artists are increasingly seeing the content of their music used against them in court.  Along with Run the Jewels’s Killer Mike and two other hip-hop scholars, Nielson drafted an amicus brief on the case, which was filed in the supreme court on Monday.  “By taking Bell’s song lyrics literally rather than as forms of artistic expression, both the school and the fifth circuit essentially delegitimized rap as an art form that is entitled to full protection under the constitution,” the brief said.  The US fifth circuit court of appeals rejected Bell’s first amendment challenge against the Itawamba school board, provoking his lawyers to file the case with the supreme court last month. The nation’s highest court agrees to hear about 100 of the more than 7,000 cases it is asked to review each year.  Nielson said rap music is increasingly being used as evidence in trials, a trend reflective of systemic racial oppression in the US.  “The defendants in these cases are almost exclusively young men of color and this attack on black speech is not at all new to our country,” Nielson said. “It is the latest example of a long tradition of fearing, censoring and frequently punishing black speech and black art and so there is no question that what is happening here is largely based on race.”  Big Boi and TI are listed as additional friends of the court alongside artists Pharoahe Monch, Boots Riley, Toni Blackman, Jasiri X and Favianna Rodriguez.  Nielson has worked with Killer Mike on the issue of criminalization of rap music “for a year or two”, so it was fitting that the rapper would want to be involved in the case, he said. Killer Mike then reached out to Big Boi and TI about co-signing the brief.  Interpreting rap lyrics as autobiographical reinforces existing stereotypes about young black men’s “inherent criminality”, Nielson said.  Bell and his mother, Dora Bell, sued the school district in February 2011 after Bell was charged with harassment and intimidation. Along with the suspension, Bell was sent to another school. He and his mother are hoping to get his record cleared, and said they only sued for $1 because the case is not about money.  The school has not denied the claims Bell made in his songs, and four female students have submitted sworn affidavits about the alleged harassment. The school district’s lawyers did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.  Bell is now 22 years old and pursuing a career in the music industry. Upon hearing that his case was getting support from luminaries like Big Boi and Killer Mike, Bell told the New York Times: “It makes me feel like a kid in a candy store.”",

        "article": "Obamacare has provided health insurance to some 20 million people. But are they any better off?  This has been the central question as we’ve been watching the complex and expensive health law unfurl. We knew the law was giving people coverage, but information about whether it’s protecting people from debt or helping them become more healthy has been slower to emerge.  A few recent studies suggest that people have become less likely to have medical debt or to postpone care because of cost. They are also more likely to have a regular doctor and to be getting preventive health services like vaccines and cancer screenings. A new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers another way of looking at the issue. Low-income people in Arkansas and Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid insurance to everyone below a certain income threshold, appear to be healthier than their peers in Texas, which did not expand.  The study took advantage of what Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an author of the paper and an assistant professor of health policy and economics at Harvard, called “a huge natural experiment.”  In its 2012 ruling, the Supreme Court made the health law’s Medicaid expansion optional for states. The resulting variation in choices makes it much easier to compare what happened in different states and draw conclusions about what effects health insurance coverage might have for the finances and health of Americans.  The researchers gathered their results by conducting a large telephone survey of low-income residents of the three states. They asked the same questions three times: in 2013, before the law’s Medicaid expansion; at the end of 2014, after it had been in place for a year; and at the end of last year. Then they compared what happened over time, using Texas as a kind of control group to see how much of a difference the Medicaid expansions in the other two states made.  Their survey found people in Arkansas and Kentucky were nearly 5 percent more likely than their peers in Texas to say they were in excellent health in 2015. And that difference was bigger than it had been the year before.  No two states are exactly the same, of course. There are many differences between Texas, Arkansas and Kentucky, besides their decisions on this part of the Affordable Care Act. The authors cautioned that their results can’t prove that Medicaid expansion caused people to be healthier.  There are differences between Arkansas and Kentucky as well. Kentucky expanded Medicaid in a more conventional way, while Arkansas tried an innovative expansion, offering its low-income residents private insurance. But the study found only small differences between the two approaches.  That finding may be of interest to states that have not expanded yet but are considering it. Louisiana this summer became the 31st state to expand its program, using an approach more like Kentucky’s. And Kentucky’s governor has considered revamping the program there to make it more like Arkansas’s.  It might sound simple to measure whether people are healthier than they used to be, but it’s actually pretty tough. While tests can tell you whether someone has high cholesterol, say, or high blood pressure, a single test may not tell the whole story. It turns out, however, that if you ask people how healthy they are, they do a pretty good job of telling you. Extensive research shows that people who say they are in poor health really are much more likely to die soon than those who describe their health as good.  The survey also asked about other subjects. It found that people in the expansion states were more likely to have a doctor and to have a place to go for care. They said they were more likely to have their chronic disease treated, and that they were more likely to have received screening for high cholesterol or high blood sugar, markers for heart disease and diabetes.  On financial measures, the study was in line with some previous studies, finding that people in Kentucky and Arkansas were less likely to postpone care or avoid taking prescribed drugs because of the cost, and that they were less likely to be struggling with a medical bill.  On almost all measures in the survey, the size of the difference between Texas and the other states was bigger in 2015 than it was in 2014. That trend makes some sense: Once you get health insurance, it might take a while before you start getting health care, and even longer before you’ll start getting healthier (optimistically assuming that you do). But the trend suggests that we may need to wait some time in evaluating the health law’s effects before we really know how big they are.  A famous experiment of low-income people in Oregon tracked one group that won a lottery to receive Medicaid coverage and another that remained uninsured. That study found that people who got insurance were much more likely than their uninsured peers to describe themselves as having good or excellent health. People who got health insurance in that experiment were also more financially secure. But the experiment did not show big changes in some key physical health measures in people they studied, like blood pressure and cholesterol.  The Oregon study followed those people only for two years. It’s possible that, given more time, those people might have shown signs of better health. (Or not. That experiment ended, but the Medicaid expansion’s natural experiment will continue for longer and may provide more clarity.)  For those of us trying to evaluate the law, the slowness of results is frustrating. Still, Tuesday’s study is quick by the standards of academic research. Big government surveys are asking some of the same questions posed by the Harvard researchers, but we’re still waiting for their data from last year. Amy Finkelstein, an economist at M.I.T. and an author on the Oregon work, described the three-state survey as “entrepreneurial,” because it gives us an early glimpse at these important questions.  It will take more time, and more research, to be sure whether the Affordable Care Act really is making Americans healthier and more secure.

        "article": "Besides cuddly koalas and the Sydney Opera House, Australia's biggest city now has another draw for Chinese tourists: driving by the $32.4 million property owned by a son of a former vice president of China.  Nestled high on a hill, above a towering sandstone wall and overlooking Sydney Harbor, the 100-year-old residence boasts some of the best views in the Emerald City. The street, Wolseley Road, was ranked the ninth most expensive in the world in a survey by Financial News.  This property, overlooking Sydney Harbor in Australia, was purchased for $32.4 million by the son of a former vice president of China.  Zeng Wei, the 43-year-old son of Zeng Qinghong, once one of the most powerful men in the Chinese Communist Party, bought the property with his wife, Jiang Mei, at the end of 2008, according to a government property database and other confirming data.  The following year, they applied to tear the old house down and build a new $5 million mansion, launching a drawn-out battle with the local council. (It was the property's exquisite site that drove the purchase price above $30 million. The figures come from local government documents and a commercial data provider that tracks Australian property prices.)  The plans were revised several times after objections from neighbors. A local court eventually found in favor of the development, but only after a shift in plans that had called for one swimming pool to cascade into another to form a waterfall along the house's front. One of the swimming pools was dropped.  The elder Mr. Zeng, long the right-hand man to former President Jiang Zemin, was a member of China's peak political body, the Politburo Standing Committee, for five years until 2007. Before that, he headed the powerful Organization Department, which is responsible for deciding who gets which political posts.  The source of his son and daughter-in-law's fortune is unclear. Ms. Jiang, 39, studied at the Beijing Dance Academy and, following a stint in television, started working for the Chinese property developer Renhe Group. There she \"is responsible for assisting…executive directors to formulate…strategies\" and is a board director, according to the 2010 annual report of Renhe's Hong Kong-listed unit, Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. Last year, the report says, she was paid 817,000 yuan ($128,000).  Both Ms. Jiang and Mr. Zeng are also directors of an Australia-registered company called Fruit Master International Ltd. Public documents don't disclose what the company does, and its accountant declined to comment.  The company's four other board members include one of China's richest men, Renhe Chairman Dai Yongge, his wife and his sister, Xiuli Hawken, with whom he helped to found Renhe. Ms. Hawken, now a U.K. resident, has been ranked by Forbes as the 15th-richest person in the U.K., worth $2.2 billion.  Efforts to reach Mr. Zeng through his lawyer and architect and through Fruit Master's accountant in Sydney failed. Media representatives from Renhe Commercial said they were unable to contact Ms. Jiang for this article.  Write to Dinny McMahon at dinny.mcmahon@wsj.com",

        "article": "I can stop the clock, the tech world has found something wrong with the new iPhone 6. Yes, the iPhone 6 Plus…. bends if you put it under a lot of pressure, as Gordon Kelly reports here on Forbes:  #Bendgate is the predictable term that has flooded social media over the last 24 hours. It comes after a video from Unbox Therapy went viral after demonstrating that it was relatively easy to bend the iPhone 6 Plus… Unbox Therapy then poured petrol on these flames with a second video (below) showing not only that trying to straighten a bent iPhone 6 Plus can shatter the screen, but that under the same tests a Galaxy Note 3 was fine.  Suddenly the argument that ‘all phones bend, stupid’ was no longer a great defence. They may, but the iPhone 6 Plus bends more.  Except that’s not the real story with long-term implications. Look around the bend and you find an issue that Apple has failed to address. I’m more concerned about the reaction from Apple’s PR team… or the lack of reaction. The #bendgate situation has answered one question I had. Apple’s PR team is still not as reactive as they should be, and has struggled once more to contain an online story. While there is a delicate art on deciding when to step in, especially in the fast-moving social media world, digitally putting your fingers in your ears and going “la-la-la” is not an option. In all the noise and kerfuffle, Apple has been far too quiet.  To be fair, the team has form in saying nothing until it’s almost too late.  iPhone 4 Bumper (image: Renato Mitr, cc Flickr)  Take antenna-gate. When held in certain ways, the signal strength received by the iPhone 4 would drop. This is not an unknown feature on any handset, and it was possible to demonstrate the ‘death grip’ on other handsets. Apple compounded the initial response (‘you’re holding it wrong’) by admitting that the code displaying the signal strength bars was flawed. Just over a month after the iPhone 4 was revealed (and everyone had a field day with jokes, memes, and MacGyvered solutions), Steve Jobs announced ‘free bumpers for all’ to solve the problem.  Other handsets live with this issue , and while design lay at the heart of the hardware fault, the communication around the issue was woefully inadequate, eventually requiring a grand gesture to temper the discussion.  Then there’s the iPhone 5C. Running up to the launch of the 5C, analysts, reporters, and bloggers, were all clamouring for a ‘cheap’ iPhone. With its plastic case and taking the role of the iPhone 5 in the middle tier of Apple’s late 2014 portfolio, the 5C was not the cheap model that was expected – instead it was a replacement iPhone 5 with some more margin for Apple.  The press and analysts didn’t buy that story. To this day the iPhone 5C carries the bad smell of failure - albeit a failure that has sold over 30 million handsets. Again, Apple’s PR management of a story had not matched the ideals of Apple’s vision.  The iPhone 6 Plus (image: Ewan Spence)  Now we have the issue of bendgate and the iPhone 6 Plus. Once more, the world’s media has latched on to a new Apple product, but not in the way that Apple would want them to. This is meant to be Apple’s phablet, the beginning of large-screened smartphone activities with iOS. Instead it is turning into a pile-on of educational proportions.  It’s probably too late to stop the iPhone 6 Plus forever being tarnished with “the phone that bends” badge. All I can think is that the PR team has not learned from previous mistakes. Climbing into the bunker and waiting it out it is not going to help them. This is rapidly becoming part of the public conversation, and I’m pretty sure Lorne Michaels and the SNL team have a bundle of “Bend it Like Apple’ skits lined up for the weekend.  How long can Apple afford to go without responding?  The Apple Watch (image: Apple PR)  Is there a deeper, more systemic problem, with Apple’s PR team? Two new products are coming out that need careful media management, consumer education, and media expectations set appropriately. Apple Pay arrives in October, and consumers will be putting their own money in the trust of Apple. Apple need to reassure them, through the media, that they are a safe pair of hands. Any mis-steps in the early days and Apple Pay may not take off.  The Apple Watch is an even bigger minefield. Nobody is really sure what a smartwatch should do, but everyone expects Apple to do it better, faster, with more battery life, and more surprises and shocks, than any of the competition. Pitch the Apple Watch correctly and you have two new industry areas for Apple to explore (the standard Silicon Valley smartwatch, and the high-end $20,000 luxury watch market) and dominate. That only works if you can successfully tell the story.  If everything works as expected, there should be no issues, and doesn’t it all work out in the end? But when does that ever happen in the consumer electronics world? The historical trends and on-going activity around from Bendgate does not fill me with confidence about Apple’s ability to navigate the choppy waters that lie ahead as they sail into a new future under Tim Cook.",

        "article": "Now a leading contender to replace Bernard Bernanke, economist Lawrence Summers (right) with Barack Obama and Timothy Geithner in 2009. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters  The battle is on to replace current US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. One might expect the Fed chairmanship – arguably the second most powerful official position in the United States, and certainly the world's most powerful financial position – to be determined by a conclave of central bankers. In fact, the choice is largely at the discretion of the US president. So let us consider two of the leading candidates, Lawrence Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, and current Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen.  Both Summers and Yellen are brilliant scholars with extensive experience in public service. Whereas the mainstream press seems intent on exploring their candidacies as a contest of contrasting personalities, both candidates are extremely well qualified. Moreover, both have a reputation for believing that the Fed should not place excessive weight on price stability relative to unemployment. Normally, this dovish bias would be a handicap; nowadays, it is an advantage.  The importance of technical competence in monetary policy has been proved repeatedly by central banks around the world. According to research published in 2003 by the economists Christina Romer and David Romer, the quality of monetary policy depends critically on whether central bankers have a clear and nuanced understanding of policy making and inflation. The 1920s, 30s, and 70s are replete with examples of central bankers who did not understand the basics, and whose economies paid the price.  What this means is not just competence in setting interest rates, but also competence in regulatory policy. Some are criticising Summers's ardent pursuit of financial deregulation during the 90s, when he headed the US Treasury under President Bill Clinton. But these critics overlook his role in helping to fight that decade's sovereign-debt crises, and his insistence that the US begin issuing inflation-indexed bonds.  In a complex and ever-changing policy setting, it is almost impossible to get every call right, and the important thing is to learn from one's mistakes. Winston Churchill famously regretted overseeing the United Kingdom's catastrophic return to the gold standard in 1925, when he was chancellor of the exchequer. His performance, needless to say, improved in later years.  As for Yellen, it is true that she was president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve during the last years of the massive US housing bubble – which was particularly acute in her district. But Yellen's speeches on financial risks showed more foresight than those of most of her peers.  Typically, one looks to the head of the central bank to serve as a bulwark against political pressure to push down interest rates and raise inflation. My own research in 1985 on inflation and central-bank independence showed that, in normal times, one generally wants a central banker who places greater emphasis on price stability relative to unemployment than an ordinary informed citizen might do. Installing a \"conservative\" central banker helps to keep inflation expectations in check, thereby holding down long-term interest rates and mitigating upward pressure on wages and prices.  For the past 25 years, the mantra of \"inflation targeting\" (introduced in my 1985 paper) has served as a mechanism for containing inflation expectations by reassuring the public of the central bank's intentions. But excessive emphasis on low inflation targets can be counterproductive in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis in 75 years.  Rather than worrying about inflation, central bankers should focus on reflating the economy. The real problem is that they have done such a good job convincing the public that inflation is the No 1 evil that it is difficult for them to persuade anyone that they are now serious about reflation. That is why appointing a \"dove\" would not be a bad thing at all.  Yellen has already developed a reputation as a dove within the Fed, with speeches consistently showing strong concern about today's high unemployment. And, though many on the left regard Summers as suspiciously conservative, that is hardly the case when it comes to inflation. His 1991 paper on monetary policy is widely cited as among the first to make the case for avoiding very low inflation targets, in part to give the central bank more room to lower interest rates. Back then, Summers clearly viewed himself as a monetary-policy dove: \"I would support having someone in charge of monetary policy who is more inflation-averse than I.\"  But now Summers's dovishness is not a problem. In the face of downward nominal-wage rigidity, higher inflation would facilitate sectoral adjustment and achieve a small but useful impact on reducing debt burdens.  If normal times call for a conservative central banker who helps to anchor inflation expectations, now is the rare time when we need a more unorthodox central banker who will fight deflation expectations. A central-bank version of the Vatican's papal conclave would have a hard time deciding whether to send up the fumata bianca for Yellen or for Summers – or perhaps for someone else (another former Fed vice chair, Donald Kohn, now appears to be in the mix) with similar inclinations.",

The option is important to the publishing industry, which relies on data about its subscribers to lure advertisers and the marketing dollars they bring with them. Before Apple added the subscription mechanism to its iTunes system, the company shared no user data with publishers -- a situation that drew complaints from the media industry.  The box Apple has added, pictured above during the sign-up process for the Daily online news and entertainment outlet, gives users the option to share data -- or not -- before the subscription begins. This is known as an opt-in choice, as opposed to the generally more business-friendly opt-out, where users are automatically enrolled in services and must actively choose to leave to prevent their information from being shared.  Apple's decision to allow users to offer their information to marketers is in one sense a concession -- publishers will now be able to get some subscriber information instead of none. But observers say it is unlikely to appease the publishing industry for a simple reason: Many users may see no advantage in sharing their personal data with marketers.  \"Probably most people will choose to ... not divulge their names,\" said Porter Bibb, a consultant at Mediatech Capital Partners and the first publisher of Rolling Stone magazine. \"One of the jobs I had some time ago was corporate development director at the New York Times Co., so I can tell you with authority that as soon as you subscribe to a magazine or newspaper, the next week you’re getting special offers they got off of your credit card.\"  The specter of that kind of marketing activity may turn users off to the idea of sharing personal data, the analysts said, even if consumers don't realize their data could help those publications prosper.  \"Consumers don’t think about that fact that the reason they get free content and free advertising is because publishers know a lot about them,\" said Sarah Rotman-Epps, a digital publishing analyst at Forrester Research. \"If you make consumers focus on that fact fewer of them will opt-in to sharing their data with publishers.  Where consumers are willing to share their information depends on whether they feel there's an upside for them, Rotman-Epps said.  \"From a consumer standpoint, what Apple is communicating to them is the potential risk and downside of sharing data with publishers, and they’re not communicating the benefit. For consumers, it’s not a benefit that publishers are going to market to you -- it’s more subtle and harder to understand than a pop-up box.\"  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the issue.

The research published in Psychological Science analysed 77,000 real UK bank spending transactions from 635 individuals across a six month period.  Participants took a personality test, and agreed to have their responses matched anonymously with the bank transaction data.  Nearly 60 spending categories were matched to five personality traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.  People who spent more money on purchases which matched their personality were found to be happier, the study found spending in the right way was more important than total income or spending.  For example, someone who scored highly for “agreeableness” and tended to spend more on charities and pets, tended to be happier.  Similarly, people considered “highly conscientious” spent about $175 more each year on health and fitness, than those who had a poor correlation to those personality traits.  Another example showed that extroverts who were forced to spend money at a bar were happier than introverts forced to spend at a bar.  “Historically, studies had found a weak relationship between money and overall well being,” Cambridge research associate Joe Gladstone told The Daily Mail.

Full credit to the Prime Minister. He has ploughed on. Open primaries are dangerous because they throw open the selection to the constituency as a whole rather than just party members. This means far more organisation, far larger meetings, a much more diverse audience – and much less control of the outcome.  The justification for the Tory leader’s decision to persevere can be seen in the selection of a series of outstanding candidates over the last few weeks. Nigel Huddlestone in Mid Worcestershire is about as far removed from the public school caricature of Cameron conservativism as one can get.  Admittedly he is a Google executive, but his mother works for Asda and his father in a factory, while he was the first graduate from his state school to get to Oxford.  Roughly the same applies to Ranil Jayawardena, who came up the hard way as deputy leader of Basingstoke Council before being selected in North East Hampshire two weeks ago. Lucy Fraser, chosen in South East Cambridgeshire, is hugely talented.  The only one of the candidates I know well is Nusrat Ghani, who was chosen at a 400-strong open public meeting last Thursday night to replace Charles Hendry as Tory candidate for Wealden. Charles Hendry was a solid citizen but Nusrat – the Conservative Party’s first female Muslim candidate for a winnable seat – has the potential to be amazing.  Born in Kashmir, brought up on a council estate, and educated at state schools, she too is a huge break from the archetypal Tory image. I know her partly through her work for the BBC in Russia and Afghanistan and also because she is a neighbour of ours in West London. Nusrat has shown huge energy and enthusiasm in supporting our admirable local MP Mary Macleod in Brentwood and Isleworth, and helping to organise the Tory vote.  Open primaries leave the decision-making with civil society as a whole and not only a core of Tory members. All the signs are that they are working, and study of the candidates fills me with the sense that there is huge energy and conviction in the coming generation of Conservative MPs.  • Labour needs Alistair Darling to replace Ed Balls • Few human beings can be compared to Jesus Christ. Nelson Mandela was one • John Bercow: a curious mixture of preening ostentation and genuine excellence",

        "article": "As numerous cases have emerged of universities’ getting payments to steer loan volume to a lender, or of university officials’ getting gifts and payments, many college officials have said that the rates offered by recommended lenders were competitive. It appears that in this case, as soon as Pratt learned of the high interest rate, it acted to cancel the relationship with the lender.  Thomas F. Schutte, president of Pratt, said in a statement released to students and faculty members that he was “pleased to inform you that Pratt is in complete compliance” with the code of conduct.  Besides Pratt, three New York colleges — Marist College, Manhattanville College and Mercy College — agreed to the code of conduct. So did Lewis & Clark College in Oregon and Texas Christian University, which also agreed to pay to student borrowers more than $13,000 that it received from one lender in exchange for greater student loan volume.  “Schools and lenders are no longer defending these practices or refusing to recognize the problem,” Mr. Cuomo said. “They are looking for a solution.”  With the six new colleges, 21 institutions, along with some of the nation’s largest student loan companies, have adopted the code of conduct, according to Mr. Cuomo’s office, and the New York Senate has passed legislation to put it into law.  At Pratt, in addition to the arrangement with Education Finance Partners, an employee served on the advisory board and received trips from another lender. Education Finance reached a separate agreement with Mr. Cuomo’s office in mid-April, adopting his code of conduct and paying $2.5 million into a fund for education of students and parents about financial aid.  Mercy College had a contract with Sallie Mae, the nation’s largest student lender, to operate a call center on behalf of the financial aid office, Mr. Cuomo’s office said, and call center operators did not identify themselves as Sallie Mae employees.  At Marist College, employees served on advisory boards to loan companies and received trips. An employee at Manhattanville College received theater tickets from Nelnet, another student loan company, and some lenders provided printing services to the institution.  Lewis & Clark and Texas Christian both had “revenue sharing” agreements, in which Education Finance paid the college based on loan volume. Lewis & Clark has already returned the money.  Separately, the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, which administers scholarship programs in New York and that guarantees federal student loans against default, also adopted the code of conduct.

        "article": "In Mexico, we are now living the end of a dream. In fact, it was always a mirage – the “Mexican moment” as it was called – created with the help of an intense campaign of public relations, a momentary economic surge, massaged statistics claiming a reduction in violence and reforms that, until now, exist only on paper.  Then there is the well-groomed presidential figure of Enrique Peña Nieto. He framed himself not only as a reformer but as the very saviour of Mexico. Incredibly, he was honoured by an international press that is now flaying him.  Since late September, the world has seen the raw, true face of the “moment”. Three students from a rural teachers’ college in Ayotzinapa were murdered and another 43 “disappeared” on 26 September in the city of Iguala, demonstrating collusion at all levels of the government with organised crime. It also showed the failure of Peña Nieto to guarantee peace, law and justice, each one elemental for the existence of a viable state.  During his first 21 months – Peña Nieto came to power in December 2012 – the president wanted to show the world how he was going to transform the “disaster country” after the “war on drugs” initiated by his predecessor, Felipe Calderón. In fact, there have been grave regressions, including an increasing abhorrence of transparency and public accountability.  Last week, a team of reporters, led by Carmen Aristegui, discovered a mansion valued at $7m (£4.4m), used by the president and his wife, Angelica Rivera, as their own, was officially listed under the name of a friend of the president. The friend won enormous contracts during Peña Nieto’s time as governor and now as president.  We could add to this revelation the remodelling project that Peña Nieto ordered upon his arrival to the official presidential residence. In a lavish expenditure of public funds, Peña Nieto transformed the building into a luxurious palace where the president, first lady and their six children now live.  For more than 14 years, the nation has lived immersed in interminable violence, with impunity for the criminals. This was all shaped by a corrupt political system created by the PRI, the political party of Peña Nieto. During more than 70 years of power, it permitted the creation and operation of drug cartels in different regions of the country. The co-existence of the government and criminal groups made the cartels ever more powerful and, increasingly, they began to penetrate institutions of the state.  With the advent of the political party Pan, and the presidency of Vicente Fox (2000-2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006-2012), the criminal structure not only remained intact but strengthened through the growth of corruption. Year after year, Mexico continued to lose ground in Transparency International’s global corruption report.  In 2001, Mexico occupied the flattering position of 51 out of 178 countries; in Calderón’s last year, 2012, it was 105 out of 176 countries. In 2013, the first year of the Peña Nieto government, Mexico had dropped another place to 106, despite the illusion of progress.  As a result of the escalating corruption, the involvement of organised crime was no longer just a matter of funding political campaigns to obtain protection. Rather, the cartels brought power to their associates, as in the case of the former mayor of Iguala, José Luis Abarca, and his wife, María de los Ángeles Pineda Villa, members of a drug trafficking clan that has operated in Guerrero and Morelos for more than a decade. The attorney general of Mexico, Jesús Murillo Karam, has accused thecouple of ordering the assassination and disappearance of the students of Ayotzinapa.  Since Peña Nieto came to power, there have been grave regressions in Mexico, one of which is the abhorrence of transparency and public accountability, a move that was led by the presidential office and replicated by other governmental institutions.  What else can be expected of this soiled government? In recent months, the military and the attorney general have presented false reports regarding crimes. Official information shows that in 2006 the number of criminal complaints not investigated by the federal government amounted to 24,000; in 2013, the number was 63,000. In Peña Nieto’s administration, law enforcement has become increasingly slow and pathetic.  Upon entering the rustic buildings of the school in Ayotzinapa, you learn the history of the dead youth. It is easy to understand why the case of Iguala has mobilised a society that in recent years has lost tens of thousands of children, mothers and fathers, at the hands of organised crime.  The majority of the young people in the school are studying to be teachers in indigenous communities or in marginalised, impoverished areas. The students come from peasant families who were exploited for decades, left without hope for a better future. For them, there never was a “Mexican moment” or a saviour. For them, the abuse and injustice, from the government, have never ceased. Despite the enormous challenges, these young students are realising their dream of bringing knowledge to others like themselves.  Daily, the mourning mothers of the disappeared children meet in the central plaza of the school where candles burn permanently, waiting for the return of those who were taken. The portraits of their sons hang from posters and banners. If you take a good look, you can see their faces in their mothers.  Forty out of the 43 disappeared students had only arrived at the school in August and they represent nearly a third of all the students in their first year. Of those who remain, 60 were taken out of school by their parents so they wouldn’t meet the same fate as their companions. Thirty stayed and they continue to water the flowers. The flowers were meant to be sold on 1 November, Day of the Dead, but today they are still there, unharvested, waiting until the disappeared return, or until there is justice.  In the eyes of the remaining students there is a sadness. Those who survived that infernal night of interminable gunfire when they yelled: “Don’t shoot, we’re students. We are not armed”, carry pain in their eyes. But what is most evident is a profound dignity and courage.  The call for justice floods the school in Ayotzinapa with the same intensity that the sun of Guerrero bathes the classrooms each morning. This call has consumed many sectors of Mexican society, cutting across economic class and political affiliation. It marks the end of the supposed dream. The press and international community can be a decisive factor in ensuring that this call for justice is not ignored.",

Presumably, he spoke more in hope than expectation, for judging by this morning’s news, banking remains as much of a political football as ever.  George Osborne’s announcement that he is increasing the banking levy to £2.5bn this year brings in a handy £800m more for deficit reduction, but the main purpose is transparently political. He’s facing his new opposite number, Ed Balls, over the dispatch box for the first time this afternoon, and he’s not got much to show from long drawn out “Project Merlin” talks with the banks on small business lending and bonuses.  Word is that Mr Osborne was reasonably happy with the yet to be fully agreed statement of intent on lending and bonuses, but the LibDems think it doesn’t go nearly far enough. The Chancellor needed some sort of a rabbit out of the hat to demonstrate he was winning proper concessions out of recalcitrant bankers. Project Merlin, with its vague commitment to lower bonuses and higher UK lending, falls a long way short in the “let’s get tough on the banks” department.  After weeks of trying, the UK Government and main British retail banks were said to be close to striking an agreement which in return for ministers toning down their banker bashing rhetoric will see banks lend more to British business and make some kind of a commitment on bonuses.  Have these talks succeeded? Only up to a point, Lord Copper. My understanding is that the agreement will be so hedged around with conditions that it’ll hardly be worth the paper it’s written on. True enough, there will be a specific figure that the banks will commit to for extra lending this year – somewhere in the region of £190bn gross. But only if commercially viable, and the net figure, including loans that are repaid, is likely to be considerably smaller.  In practice, all these numbers are fairly meaningless. As it happens, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are as a whole not net borrowers from the banking system at all, but net depositors. Do we really want to turn our responsibly run small businesses, with money in the bank to keep them afloat during the hard times, into a nation of borrowers? I don’t think so. Forced lending is what underlay the credit crunch.  The UK banks have always maintained that the problem with lending is lack of demand, not supply. It’s perfectly true that covenants and lending conditions have been widely tightened, but this is only in an attempt to restore traditional standards of credit assessment after the abnormal credit conditions of the boom, when any Tom, Dick or Harry could secure a loan on minimum security and terms.  It’s also true that typically, credit continues to contract during the first few years of any economic recovery. This is because it takes time for businesses to become confident enough to run down their cash balances and start borrowing once more. The early stages of a recovery tend to be characterised by a rise in transactions, or the velocity of money, rather than an expansion in credit. Economic activity grows because the same amount of money is more frequently used.  Still, the Government wants the banks to be ready to lend for when sentiment does finally shift from the current obsession of cash accumulation to investment in the future. The priority has therefore been to ensure banks have sufficient capital and liquidity to support this investment. There is a sense in which the bank bashing is itself a barrier to confidence, for the uncertainty both makes banks more reluctant to lend and companies less inclined to invest.  It’s easy to be cynical, but if you want to put a positive spin on the outcome of the Project Merlin talks it would be this. Anything that brings government and the banks together in pursuit of economic renewal after the ill tempered paralysis of the last two years must be broadly welcome. Trouble is that politics keeps getting in the way. It’s all very well acting tough by taxing the bankers more, but the upshot is less capital for lending and a further devaluation of the taxpayer shareholdings in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.  Mr Osborne has made a political judgment, not an economic or financial one.",

Teacher Emily Fox, 26, exchanged hundreds of ‘sexually explicit’ texts with one of the students at Royal Masonic School for Girls in Hertfordshire, UK before progressing to kissing and sexual touching.  Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod told St Albans Crown Court the pair's relationship began in November 2012 and was discovered in August last year when the victim tried unsuccesfully to print a letter from Fox.  \"A week later the father was using the printer when that document was printed,\" Ms Mealing-McLeod told the court. \"It clearly disclosed some sort of relationship.\"  While the girl's father didn't notice the email it was picked up by her mother who contacted the school.  An investigation revealed the pair had first met at the school before exchanging numbers and getting together to watch TV.  Over time the two became closer with the young girl telling her teacher she \"loved her as a friend\" and \"cared for her\".  Over a period of around a year the pair exchanged \"hundreds and hundreds\" of increasingly sexually explicit messages using the WhatsApp mobile application.  Fox, from Bath, voluntarily attended Hartfield police station on September 6 last year and admitted four counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.  Judge Stephen Gullick sentenced Fox to concurrent sentences of one month, six months and two of 15 months telling her \"this type of behaviour from teachers towards pupils is not to be viewed as anything other than extremely grave\".  She will be on the sex offenders’ register for ten years.  Do you have any news photos or videos?",

        "article": "The Entrepreneur Insiders network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “What’s the best way to make fruitful connections?” is written by David Slayden, executive director of BDW.  There is tremendous value in having connections. And I do appreciate how fortunate I am to have an exceptional network of people to call on when I have questions, need insight, or want to make things happen. And though I’m no longer surprised when people remark that I “know everybody,” usually in the context of my role as executive director of BDW, I’m never sure how to react to it. After all, I’m an introvert—someone who cultivates quiet and solitude and thinks a good day out is five hours alone on a bike in the mountains.  So how did I get to know everybody?  In my experience—and probably yours—a typical networking event takes place in a large, noisy venue—with a bar, of course—and is full of people talking loud and fast, exchanging cards, and then moving along quickly to the next conversation. In such an environment, quantity seems destined to trump quality. It’s admittedly not a great scene, but is more often than not “the scene,” and will continue.  So how can you work with this scene rather than getting worked by it? Find out what doesn’t work for you and stop doing it. It’s about becoming and remaining genuine, which can be tough because it makes us feel vulnerable. Becoming genuine is an ongoing practice built on recognizing and ceasing to practice behaviors that are unproductive for you and your business. It’s a simple practice, but not an easy one.  See also: The Hardest Part of Networking  Here’s a brief field guide of what not to do and how to feel better about yourself in the process:  Don’t talk when you can listen This will probably feel counter-intuitive at first, particularly because of the widely accepted concept that networking is about putting ourselves out there. Listening is essentially a pull strategy, and learning to ask questions and cultivate an attitude of interest in the person you’re talking to will make you live in their memory much more effectively than talking about yourself.  Don’t try to control the conversation Put away all of your talking points and stock phrases. Let the conversation go where it naturally goes rather than contriving ways to bring it back to that key point you intended to make. That key point out of context will deservedly come off as irrelevant (because it is) and out of nowhere. You can also adopt a personal rule to stick to answering questions rather than delivering monologues.  Stop selling All successful businesspeople are good at sales. They (and you) can smell a canned pitch a mile away. So don’t do it. This doesn’t mean that you can’t talk about your business to people, which would likely come off as false self-modesty. But when you do talk about your business, talk like a human who is talking to another human—and not a customer. It’s a good opportunity to express the heart and soul of your business, and that “why” is the emotional truth that will be remembered.  Don’t complain This is not an admonition to lock into a mindset of eternal sunshine, but a reminder to understand and remember that nobody likes a whiner. Whining is essentially a practice of blaming others or conditions for our failures. Be realistic but not fatalistic. Everyone in business understands that business can be hard, of course, but it’s one thing to acknowledge this truth and work with it and quite another to complain about it.  Don’t kiss ass We’ve all done this, and I think that most of us can agree that it doesn’t work for either party. It makes us feel funky and tells the other person that we are fundamentally insincere.  Networking is fundamentally about establishing and developing lasting functional relationships. It will pay you to remember that all good relationships are based in being and remaining genuine.",

        "article": "The Senate has passed a comprehensive immigration bill thanks, in large part, to the efforts of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Debate in Republican and conservative circles has already begun about whether Rubio helped or hurt his 2016 presidential prospects with the critical role he played in crafting the legislation and pushing it to passage.  We can argue it both ways. So we will. Today we make the case that Rubio ultimately helped himself in regards the 2016 presidential race during the immigration debate. Tomorrow, we will make the opposite case. Which do you agree with?  Marco Rubio made a giant gamble by going all-in on the immigration debate in the Senate. And he won — big time.  Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, celebrating.  Let’s start with this fact: As the highest profile Hispanic Republican elected official in the country, this wasn’t a fight that Rubio was going to be able to sidestep. If he had tried to take a lower profile role, he would have been called out for ducking the issue. Knowing he was going to get pushed into the fight, he jumped in — which is always smart in politics.  Rubio then methodically did everything he personally could to make sure that the certain opposition of some faction of conservatives did not paralyze the effort to pass the bill. What Rubio understood from the start was that the key to the bill succeeding was not convincing every Republican to vote for it — since that would be impossible. Rather, he sought to keep the opposition somewhat muted outside of the Senate and filibuster-free inside the chamber.  Rubio faced down his critics with regularity — doing scads of appearances with conservative talk radio hosts like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and on Fox News Channel. Rubio even went to the Senate floor in the final days of the immigration debate in the Senate to rebut some of the most common attacks on the bill. Here’s that speech:  The idea — forwarded by Rubio’s critics — that he will be pilloried for his support of immigration reform is based on this false premise: That Republican primary voters won’t support someone who, on a high profile issue, feels differently than they do.  People predicting doom for Rubio in 2016 over immigration tend to cite Mitt Romney’s struggles to move beyond the health care law he signed in Massachusetts as governor. Yes, there is NO question that Romney’s past position on health care hurt him among conservatives in 2012. But, consider:  1. There was already a storyline about Romney as a flip-flopper left over from the 2008 campaign when he changed positions on abortion. The health care law in Massachusetts played into the idea that Romney would say whatever fit the political moment. Rubio doesn’t have that issue.  2. Romney never really got his message on health care right. He constantly insisted that his plan was good for Massachusetts but that it shouldn’t be replicated nationally – and never really explained why. Rubio has a clearer message: Keeping the status quo on immigration in place is far worse than the alternative he backed.  3. Romney won the Republican primary.  Politicians who have failed to sell an issue position where they stand apart from their party almost always fail because they come across as inauthentic. (See: Romney, Mitt.) Principled opposition can be sold — as long as it is genuinely principled.  Part of the appeal of someone like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, for example, is not that he lines up exactly with the Republican base but rather that on those issues that he differs, he does so with genuine conviction. Opposing the use of drones is not exactly an issue that wins Republican primaries but Paul’s filibuster on the issue was the single most important moment in the already-started 2016 race so far this year.  Rubio will be able to offset much — though not all — of the criticism that will come his way from conservatives by standing on principle, insisting that he thought it was the right thing to do for the country (and the Republican party) and acknowledging that not every one is going to agree with him on every issue.  Then there are the obvious benefits Rubio gets from his involvement in immigration.  * As we noted last week, the major donors of the GOP — the men and women who serve as building blocks for financing presidential campaigns and write big checks to super PACs — want immigration reform. And now Rubio is not only on their side but their chief advocate.  * The 50,000 foot narrative about Republicans over the past several years is that they are increasingly insular and unwilling to compromise. Rubio, by dint of his role in the “Gang of 8″, can present himself as something quite different than that stereotype. Obviously that helps him with independents if he gets to the 2016 general election but we wouldn’t underestimate the number of Republicans who also might be looking for a new message/messenger come 2016.  * Rubio is now not just a Hispanic Republican Senator but a Hispanic Republican Senator who played a key role in trying to reform the immigration system. If ever there was a Republican candidate who could make a convincing case to Hispanics as to why they should at least consider voting GOP, Rubio is now the one.  There is good and bad in any major legislative move by a politician as high profile as Rubio. But, the bad here can be counteracted and the good outweighs it anyway. Count Rubio as a winner on immigration — no matter what (if anything) the House does next.",

He called his actions inexcusable and apologized to his wife, Maria Shriver, his children and his family.  \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger told the Los Angeles Times in a statement early Tuesday. \"I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family. There are no excuses and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children and my family. I am truly sorry.\"  \"I ask that the media respect my wife and children through this extremely difficult time,\" the statement concluded. \"While I deserve your attention and criticism, my family does not.\"  In a statement to FoxNews.com, Shriver said \"This is a painful and heartbreaking time. As a mother, my concern is for the children. I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal. I will have no further comment.\"  VOTE: Which Celeb Sex Scandal the Most Shocking?  The shocking revelation was apparently the impetus for Shriver to leave the couple’s home before they announced their separation last week after 25 years of marriage.  Schwarzenegger and Shriver made a public announcement May 9 that they were splitting up, but according to the L.A Times, Shriver moved out of the family’s Brentwood mansion earlier this year after Schwarzenegger announced the affair with his staffer.  The unnamed staffer reportedly worked for the family for 20 years and retired in January. The L.A. Times approached the woman, who initially denied that Schwarzenegger was the father, saying instead it was her husband at the time.  After Schwarzenegger's confession, she declined to offer further comment, saying she voluntarily left her position with the family “on good terms.”  “I wanted to achieve my 20 years, then I asked to retire,” she told the Times adding that she received a severance payment from the former couple.  Schwarzenegger reportedly accepted financial responsibility for the child from the start and continues to provide support. It is unclear whether or not the child knew that Schwarzenegger was the father.  From the start, the Schwarzenegger-Shriver union seemed an unlikely pairing. She was a Kennedy, well-respected journalist and a Democrat, while he was a Republican bodybuilder turned movie star.  Shriver, 55, stood by her husband during his 2003 gubernatorial campaign after the Los Angeles Times reported accusations that he had a history of groping women. Schwarzenegger later said he \"behaved badly sometimes.\"  In an interview that year with Oprah Winfrey, Shriver balked at allegations that she was taught, as a Kennedy woman, to “look the other way.”  “That ticks me off, I am my own woman, I have not been quote ‘bred’ to look the other way,” she told the talk show host.  Schwarzenegger, for his part, publicly credited Shriver’s support with helping him to win the election.  In his first public comments since the couple announced their breakup, Schwarzenegger said last week that he and Shriver \"both love each other very much.\"  \"We are very fortunate that we have four extraordinary children and we're taking one day at a time,\" he said at a Los Angeles event marking Israeli independence. Their four children range in age from 13 to 21.  Schwarzenegger has received support from his four other children since the couple announced the news of their split.  Following the announcement, a 52-year-old former child actress, Gigi Goyette, claimed that she was one of many Schwarzenegger mistresses over the course of his 25-year-marriage. In 2005, the L.A. Times reported that two days after he announced his campaign for governor in 2003, a tabloid publisher with close ties to Schwarzenegger paid Goyette $20G for her silence about their relationship.  Since his term as California governor ended in early January, Schwarzenegger, 63, has hopscotched around the world, his wife nowhere in sight. While the \"Terminator\" star appeared confident about the future since exiting politics, cutting movie deals and fashioning himself as a global spokesman for green energy, Shriver, known for her confidence, seemed unsettled.  In a YouTube video posted on her website in March, she asked her fans “how do you handle transitions in your life?”  “It is so stressful to not know what you’re doing next, when people ask you ‘ what are you doing?’ and then they can’t believe that you don’t know what you’re doing and then every idea you have you think, ‘well, maybe I shouldn’t do that.’  “So I thought to myself, I’ll ask you guys … I’d like to hear from other people who are in transition. How did you find your transition? Personal, professional, emotional, spiritual, financial … how’d you get through it?”  Shriver maintained her own identity when her husband entered politics promoting volunteer work and directing conferences, although she gave up her job at NBC.  On Friday, she thanked her Twitter followers for supporting her.  “Thank you for all the kindness, support and compassion. I am humbled by the love,\" she wrote. \"Thank you.”  The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

And after experiencing flooding that put employees' homes underwater, a firm in the service industry built a contingency office near the airport, housed their workers in a hotel, and provided them with laptops so that they could work remotely.  (Read more: Airlines try to rebound from worst travel day yet)  Some of these examples are highlighted in Global Risks 2014, recently released by the World Economic Forum and discussed at the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Now in its ninth year, the report focused attention on what companies can do to reduce catastrophic risks — the calamities that can create havoc with both their short- and long-term operations.  Here are four tips for firms to reduce the likelihood and consequences of catastrophic risks:  Recognize interdependencies in designing risk-management strategies. A weak link in your supply network could significantly impede your production operations. It's important to construct worst-case scenarios so you can determine how interdependencies can severely impact your operations — and make contingency plans.  For example, a health-care services company now relies on two suppliers, so that if one is not functional, they can turn to the other to pick up the slack. And a computer firm maintains an excess inventory of finished products and supplies to hedge against sudden fluctuations in the availability of materials.  (Read more: Storms cost International Paper $40-$50 million: CEO)  Develop a business-continuity plan. Clearly define the structure of leadership roles during a crisis for all parts of the company. Examining the consequences of extreme events will improve everyone's performance when a crisis occurs.  Firms in the financial, health-care and informational-technology sectors have developed general crisis plans that create redundancies, enabling them to continue to operate even if they lose mission-critical processes. Financial firms, on the other hand, rely on \"can-happen\" scenarios and examine how their plans would play out should a catastrophe occur.  Involve the board of directors prior to the next disaster. Highlight the consequences of extreme events so that executives and board members will pay attention to them and take action to reduce future losses.  For example, in one consumer-products firm, company executives meet quarterly with the governing board's audit committee to assess the potential impact of its most serious risks.  (Read more: GM to restore Corvettes swallowed by sink hole)  Does your board play an active role in assessing your firm's risk-management plan?  Boards have only recently become involved in the risk-management activities of firms. Over 30 percent of firms we interviewed reported that this had happened within the past three years; another 35 percent said they'd only done this in the past 4-7 years.  Interact with leaders from the public sector. Public-private partnerships are increasingly essential for managing catastrophic risks. So, it's important for company executives to have good relations with federal, state and local governments, and work with them to develop a realistic risk-management plan. Public-sector agencies have also begun to realize the importance of this to keep businesses and communities running smoothly in a crisis — and to keep a level playing field.  Companies need to shift to more deliberative long-term thinking rather than just short-term thinking (such as quarterly returns). The chief risk officer can facilitate a culture of long-term thinking and risk awareness by working actively with the firm's top executives and directors.  Howard Kunreuther is a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and co-director of its Risk Management and Decision Processes Center. He is also co-author of several books, including \"At War With the Weather\" and \"Insurance and Behavioral Economics: Improving Decisions in the Most Misunderstood Industry.\"",

Jason Causon, of Coburg North, has been charged with attempted child stealing, attempted kidnap and committing an indecent act over the incidents involving a four-year-old and 11-year-old on Friday.  The 44-year-old, who denies the allegations, was refused bail in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday after police said he posed a risk to the community.  Causon allegedly approached the four-year-old girl as she played with her mother in Oak Park, the court heard.  Constable Julie Hose said Causon asked the woman for directions before remarking: \"What a cute little girl.\"  The girl's mother became concerned and called to her daughter, before Causon allegedly grabbed the youngster and partially pulled her pants down, the court heard.  He fled, got in a car and drove off after the girl's mother ran at him, Con Hose alleged.  Causon's second alleged victim was an 11-year-old, who was leaving a school in Melbourne's northwest with a friend.  He allegedly approached the pair, asked for directions and then grabbed the girl, who started screaming.  \"He dropped her and pushed her over,\" Con Hose told the court.  The girls fled and the school principal phoned authorities.  Causon was arrested in a car shortly afterward and rolls of gaffer tape were allegedly found in the vehicle, the court heard.  Magistrate Alan Spillane asked Causon why he should grant him bail, considering the \"extremely serious\" offences he was charged with.  \"It would appear there is a strong case against you,\" the magistrate said.  Causon, who represented himself, said he was \"flabbergasted\".  \"I've never done anything like that and I would never,\" he said.  \"I don't know what else to say.  \"I'm not a danger to the public, I'm a good person.\"  Causon has been remanded in custody to front court again on November 4.

It’s her dedication to Huber that led Lucci to her role as an ambassador for the Facing AFib™ program.  Eleven years ago, Huber went to the doctor for a routine pre-op physical – only he never made it into surgery.  \"He had no symptoms of anything being wrong, but he came out with a diagnosis of AFib, a type of irregular heartbeat,\" Lucci said. \"He called me at work and we were both really shocked. My husband has always been really active and athletic.\"  AFib is short for atrial fibrillation, a potentially serious condition where the heart beats irregularly and can lead to the formation of blood clots. These clots can travel from the heart to the brain, where they can possibly lead to a stroke, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  An estimated 2.3 million Americans have the disorder, and the incidence is expected to rise to 3.3 million over the next decade.  Symptoms – although they don’t always exist in patients – can include fluttering in the chest, dizziness, fatigue, heart palpitations, a racing heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath and sweating.  Doctors can diagnosis AFib by conducting an electrocardiogram on patients.  People living with AFib are five times more likely to suffer a stroke, and the condition is associated with an estimated 15 percent of strokes in the United States. Strokes caused by AFib are two times as likely to be fatal or two times as likely to be severely debilitating as non-AFib-related strokes.  That’s why it’s so important to prevent AFib strokes and why Lucci wants to bring awareness to the medical condition.  \"We feel so lucky that he did get the diagnosis,\" Lucci said. \"His health has been wonderful since then because we got the right information and we went to the right doctor. He’s still skiing and playing golf and traveling all over the place with me.\"  As the celebrity ambassadors behind Facing AFib™, Lucci and Huber have set out to educate the American public about the disorder and encourage those with it to take certain steps to reduce their risk of stroke.  Facing AFib™ is a multi-year program that improves communication between the patient and doctor, offers an interactive online risk assessment tool and a personalized doctor discussion guide.  Treatment options for AFib include medication to restore your heart rhythm, a pacemaker to control the heart rate or cardioversion and ablation. A patient who is diagnosed with AFib is often put on an anticoagulant to reduce his or her risk of developing a stroke.  Cardioversion is when the heart rate is converted to a normal rhythm using electricity. Ablation is a procedure in which the tissue surrounding the short circuit is destroyed.  Huber opted for medication, diet modification and exercise.  \"He’s used to an Austrian diet – butter, jam, hot dogs, sausage and cheese – now he’s on a Mediterranean diet – and he’s learned to love it, it’s a different way of eating, but a healthier way of eating,\" Lucci said.  Huber agreed he has never felt better, and since he has changed his diet, he has \"even lost 10 pounds.\"  \"As long as anyone with this condition goes to the doctor and follows the program, they should be fine,\" he said. \"I feel fantastic. I still exercise, golf and ski. But it was a real shock to me. I never knew anyone who had that . . .(the doctor) really had to explain it to me. I learned a number of people have this condition.\"  Lucci said she tries to accompany Huber to his doctor’s appointments whenever possible.  \"I think that’s a good idea; two heads are better than one,\" she said. \"Sometimes the person diagnosed might not hear everything because they are dealing with the diagnosis.\"  As for Lucci – how does she keep her body so slender and youthful-looking?  \"We all get a certain gene pool; I got lucky,\" she said, a sincere smile lighting up her face. \"And it's up to us to take care of ourselves. I really do use Youthful Essence (her skin care line) and I always do Malibu Pilates. Whenever I do any kind of exercise, it’s all based around Pilates.”",

        "article": "ANKARA, Turkey — Prospects for a peaceful solution to Syria’s conflict on the eve of a cease-fire deadline appeared to diminish further Monday as Turkish officials accused the Syrian military of shooting at Syrian refugees inside Turkey for the first time, and a senior Foreign Ministry official said the cease-fire plan was void.  The Turks said Syrian army shooters attacked a group of Syrian civilians who were crossing the border at Kilis, Turkey, seeking sanctuary in a large refugee camp there; at least 23 people were wounded, and two of them later died. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials also said the Syrian shooters hit at least four people inside the camp — two Syrian refugees, a Turkish policeman and a Turkish translator — who had sought to help the group fleeing across the border. Their condition was not clear.  Syria’s ranking diplomats in Ankara were summoned to the Foreign Ministry and informed of “Turkey’s irritation about the incident in a harsh tone,” said one Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his diplomatic position.  There was no immediate response from Syria. If the Turkish account of is confirmed, the events would be the first time since Turkish authorities began sheltering Syrian refugees in the 13-month-old conflict that the Syrian military had fired at targets inside Turkey.  The attack raised troubling questions about the possibility of a broader conflagration in the tinderbox border region. And it deepened the gloom about the cease-fire under a peace proposal by Kofi Annan, the special envoy to Syria for both the Arab League and the United Nations. The proposal called for government forces to pull back from major cities by Tuesday and for all combatants in the conflict to cease all hostilities by Thursday.  The border violence also afflicted Lebanon, where a Lebanese television station said Syrian soldiers killed one of its cameramen and wounded a colleague as both were filming from the Lebanese side. The television station, Al-Jadeed, said the shooting took place in the Wadi Khaled region of northern Lebanon, according to news agency dispatches from Lebanon.  President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his opponents have accused each other of escalating armed violence ahead of the Tuesday deadline. But the Syrian government imposed a new condition on Sunday, asserting it wants written guarantees from the enemy before the pullback of Syrian forces. Ahmad Fawzi, Mr. Annan’s spokesman, said such guarantees were not part of the original cease-fire agreement.  Turkish officials, who have become Mr. Assad’s most outspoken critics in the region, have said they have little faith that he would abide by terms of the cease-fire, based on a history of broken commitments in the Syrian conflict, which has left at least 9,000 people dead since it broke out in March 2011. On Monday, Naci Koru, a deputy foreign minister, appeared to go one step further, declaring that the Tuesday deadline had become “void at this stage,” Turkish news media reported.  Hundreds of Syrians have crossed into Turkey in recent weeks, bringing the total number of refugees there to more than 24,300, according to the prime minister’s office in Ankara. Turkey has built several camps in its southern provinces along the 550-mile border with Syria. Just last week, more than 2,800 Syrians entered Turkey within the space of two days, and a further 700 arrived on Saturday, according to Turkish accounts.  Mr. Annan was expected to arrive in Turkey’s Hatay Province on Tuesday to visit some of the camps. Two United States senators, John McCain of Arizona and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who were visiting Turkey to confer with members of the Syrian National Council, the leading exile opposition group, also planned to visit a camp in Hatay on Tuesday, an official at the United States Embassy said. Both senators have been outspoken in calling for more action to help anti-Assad elements in Syria.As the deadline for the cease-fire approached, China urged both sides on Monday to abide by Mr. Annan’s proposals. China, along with Russia, has blocked Western and Arab demands at the United Nations for a tougher stance to force Mr. Assad from office as part of a transition to democratic rule.  “China urges the Syrian government and opposition groups to seize the current critical moment to abide by cease-fire and troop withdrawal promises, cooperate with special envoy Annan’s mediation efforts to alleviate the current tense situation and facilitate humanitarian assistance, and promote a political solution to the conflict in Syria,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, told a regular news briefing in Beijing.  The developments occurred as Human Rights Watch said that Syrian security forces had executed more than 100 people, and possibly many more, including civilians and wounded or captured opposition fighters, during recent attacks.  A report by the group documented what it called more than a dozen episodes in which at least 101 people had been killed since the end of last year, many of them in March. The report accused government and pro-government forces of executing civilians who posed no threat, as well as rebels who had been captured or had stopped fighting.  Ole Solvang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “In a desperate attempt to crush the uprising, Syrian forces have executed people in cold blood, civilians and opposition fighters alike. They are doing it in broad daylight and in front of witnesses, evidently not concerned about any accountability for their crimes.”  There was no immediate response to the report from the Syrian government.  Sebnem Arsu reported from Ankara, and Alan Cowell from London. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Rick Gladstone from New York.",

Smith said she's closing B. Smith's, at W. 47th Street and Eighth Avenue, because she and Weinstein were unable to renegotiate a partnership agreement that expires at the end of the year.  \"It was not amicable,\" she said.  Smith complained that Ark, a national restaurant company with $117 million in sales last year, took advantage of her during their 10-year arrangement. \"Over the years it's been a very bad deal,\" she said  It was not amicable,\" she said.  Smith complained that Ark, a national restaurant company with $117 million in sales last year, took advantage of her during their 10-year arrangement. \"Over the years it's been a very bad deal,\" she said.  Smith also tried and failed to buy control of the site from Weinstein, who has the long-term lease. But she contends he put too high a price on it because of the revitalization of nearby Times Square.  Smith - who also operates a B. Smith's restaurant along the water in Sag Harbor, Long Island - said she is looking for space in midtown for a new restaurant about the same size as the Eighth Avenue eatery, which has 140 seats in its main dining room and space for private parties and special musical events upstairs.  Weinstein declined to comment on the details of the breakup, but said he wishes Smith well. \"I enjoyed the relationship,\" he said. \"They were successful and we were successful.\"  Another stormy relationship in the restaurant business has ended: Madison Square Garden has refused to renew the Riese Organization's lease of Charley O's and is replacing it with a steakhouse run by Restaurant Associates, sources said.  There has been a history of bad blood between Dennis Riese, the head of the restaurant company, and Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts.  In 1997, Riese unsuccessfully sued the Garden after Checketts revoked the Riese family's mid-court season tickets for Knicks and Rangers games. He charged that Checketts was being spiteful because Riese would not agree to his proposed changes to a Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant in the Seventh Avenue arcade leading into the arena.  Since then, the Beefsteak Charlie's has been taken over by Vornado Realty. The closing of Charley O's severs the only remaining Riese relationship with the Garden.  Riese declined to comment. Barry Watkins, a spokesman for Checketts, said the decision not to extend the Riese Organization's lease \"had nothing to do with personalities.\" He wouldn't confirm plans to open a steakhouse.  Former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos might need a whole bunch of empty boxes.  A source said the author and ABC political commentator has signed a contract to sell his Riverside Drive apartment, less than three years after plopping down $550,000 for his bachelor pad.  Sources said the rising media star is eying a  penthouse atop a swank co-op on W. 86th St., between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, said to be worth more than $1 million.  The move is surprising because Stephanopoulos spared no expense in decorating his apartment, which was even featured in Architectural Digest. However, Stephanopoulos, who was spotted in front of the W. 86th St. building late yesterday, told a source he was renting there, not buying.  Tommy Hilfiger, the high-flying fashion  company, is continuing to gobble up space on W. 39th Street.  The trendy manufacturer, headquartered in the 16-story building at 25 W. 39th St., has leased 23,000-square-feet of space at 42 W. 39th St. for offices and showrooms, a company spokeswoman said.

We also filmed my one man show that will be out in the spring and I’ve got an album that I’m terrified of that I’ve got to work on.  FOX 411: Why are you terrified?

FOX 411: You’re a grandfather of three. Do you spoil them rotten? Shatner: I spoil them rotten but the lessons I learned of what not to do with my own kids, I’m trying to tell my daughters.

The production version of a concept car that debuted at the 2011 Qatar motor show, the XL1 makes use of a plug-in hybrid powertrain comprised of a 27-horsepower electric motor and a turbocharged 2-cylinder diesel engine producing 47hp, which is matched to a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch gearbox. The bottom line: the XL1 returns a truly stellar 261mpg. To put that figure in perspective, that is New York to Washington DC on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Or Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Or London to Liverpool. It is impressive.  Drawing power from a lithium-ion battery pack, the XL1 can cruise for up to 32 miles on electric power alone. And although scintillating performance is hardly the XL1’s MO, performance is respectable: the 0-60mph sprint happens in 12.7 seconds and, with a determined (and patient) right foot, the speedometer needle will swing all the way to a limiter-governed 99mph.  Abetting its pursuit of maximum fuel economy, the XL1 wears seriously slippery bodywork. With a drag coefficient of just 0.19, it is the world’s most aerodynamic production car. (There is a nod to Honda’s original Insight coupe in its teardrop shape, no bad thing.) Total weight is a feathery 1,750lbs. Photos that have existed for more than two years do not do justice to the XL1. Here is a coupe that is low and tapered, with a sports car’s purposeful stance; its roofline is 5.1in lower than that of a Porsche Boxster. Like the Tesla Model S sedan, the XL1 offers compelling proof that environmental consciousness can be sexy.  The 2014 XL1’s launch will happen gradually.

Apple aapl patched the vulnerabilities in its latest batch of software updates this week—still, it is incumbent upon people actually to download the updates. (Do it, yes!)  “This is very high severity issue,” Craig Williams, senior technical lead and head of global outreach at Cisco csco Talos, the networking giant’s threat intelligence division, told Fortune on a call. “The fact that you have an exploit without any user interaction makes me very concerned.”  Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.  The issues affect ImageIO, a programming interface that reads and writes image data. Here’s how an exploit could work: If an attacker were to send someone a booby-trapped multimedia message (MMS), for example, containing malicious code in a “tagged image file format” (abbreviated as TIFF, a format like JPEG or PNG), then the code would start executing as soon as it was received.  “What makes iMessage insidious is that it cues it,” Williams said, stressing that the hack could also be delivered via other means, such as by email or webpage, as well. (These other methods would require a person to open the message or visit the website using a Safari browser to initiate the attack though.)  Ultimately, an attack could give a hacker access to portions of a computer’s memory, which could contain sensitive information, such as passwords and login credentials, Williams said. The issues affect recent versions of iPhone’s iOS, Mac’s OS X El Capitan, Apple TV’s tvOS, and Apple Watch’s watchOS software. (See the linked pages for more information, as well as this technical post on the Cisco Talos blog.)  For more on smartphone software vulnerabilities, watch:  “An attacker could send a thousand iMessages to victims and the second they turn their phones on they’re infected,” Williams added. In this way, the flaws recall the Stagefright vulnerabilities that affected Google’s goog Android software last year—although the Android issues were more severe since they remained effectively unpatched for longer and gave hackers greater control over affected devices.  A word of advice? Patch up. “Exploitation wise, Talos estimates there is about a two-week effort to get from the information we disclosed publicly to a fully working exploit with a decent amount of reliability,” Tyler Bohan, the security researcher at Cisco Talos who uncovered and reported the bug, told Forbes Tuesday.  Another reason to patch up pronto: Another bug affecting Apple software—this one discovered by a Salesforce crm security engineer—lets snoops eavesdrop on FaceTime calls. The newly issued iOS 9.3.3 fixes that problem, too.  As with any security fixes, people “should apply the patch immediately,” Williams said.",

        "article": "In its brochures, Deloitte Consulting proclaims a record of “smooth implementations” of complex technology projects. But in courts, school systems, and government agencies in several states, the roll-out of computer systems built by the global consulting firm has proved to be anything but smooth.  From Florida and Pennsylvania to California, multimillion-dollar projects managed by the New York company have come in behind schedule, over budget, and riddled with problems. It is a situation that has been repeated in Massachusetts this summer; Deloitte was two years late and $6 million over budget in delivering a system to manage unemployment claims, and, separately, the Department of Revenue fired the firm for falling behind on a $114 million tax-system overhaul mired in errors.  In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, school officials fired Deloitte in 2009, partway through an $84 million contract to overhaul the district’s computer system. After paying Deloitte $30 million and having “virtually nothing” usable they could rescue, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said, the district turned the project over to its in-house technology department, which completed it on time and within the budget.  “After much review the best thing to do was terminate Deloitte, and we did with a vengeance,” Carvalho said. “We cut out the middleman.”  In a statement, Deloitte defended its efforts on public contracts, saying it has worked with agencies in 45 states.  “Thousands of these projects have been delivered without incident and we acknowledge the challenges we’ve had with certain engagements,’’ Dan Prince, a Deloitte spokesman, said. “That said, we’re proud of what we’ve done in this segment and would not want these few projects to be held up as reflective of our entire body of work.’’  The problems with several of Deloitte’s systems also spotlight the difficulties that state and local governments often have in managing large technology projects, contracting specialists said. Few agencies have the will to end a project that is going badly, often fearing they will not find another firm to take over the job.  In Massachusetts, for instance, state labor officials agreed to pay Deloitte an extra $4 million to keep working after the firm missed its first deadline to deliver the system in 2011.  Eric Kimberling, a consultant who has testified in disputes over large technology contracts, said such projects are frequently riddled with problems because public officials underestimate what it takes to complete them and consultants “lowball the cost to get their foot in the door.”  Many government agencies have to get halfway through a contract before “they know what it’s really going to take to get a project done right,” said Kimberling, managing partner of Panorama Consulting Solutions of Denver.  A project for California’s massive court system shows how bad it can get.  Officials hired Deloitte and another firm in 2003 to create a statewide case management system, connecting 58 county courts, as well as appellate courts. By 2010, Deloitte was running the entire job, and the contract had been amended 102 times, ballooning in cost to $310 million from $33 million, according to a state audit.  Worse, the cost to install the software had been wildly underestimated. The total price tag soared to a projected $1.9 billion, so expensive that the courts could not afford to put the system into operation.  “We basically got this nice SUV that can really do everything but we can’t afford to get it out on the road,’’ said Cathal Conneely, spokesman for California’s Administrative Office of the Courts.  The state audit blamed the court system for agreeing to contract terms that failed to ensure it had sufficient oversight of Deloitte.  Howard Anderson, a senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said states rarely have IT teams that are equipped to oversee big projects, in part because people with technical talent can earn far more working for private companies. In addition, states rarely have the resources of a global giant like Deloitte, with about 61,000 US employees.  “Essentially, they are outmanned and outgunned,’’ Anderson said. “The state needs help, and they can’t afford to have that help internally.’’  That is one of the reasons that firms like Deloitte successfully court state governments and win vast amounts of business, IT contracting specialists said. In Massachusetts, the state has paid Deloitte Consulting at least $130 million for taxpayer-funded projects since 2010, according to the state’s Open Checkbook site, which tracks contracts.  In Los Angeles, school officials watched the cost of one Deloitte system jump 35 percent above its original price. The payroll system, which eventually cost $132 million, was plagued by hardware and software breakdowns that underpaid or overpaid teachers and school employees by tens of millions of dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times.  The city had to establish emergency hot lines, which were overwhelmed by calls. The school district sued, and in 2008 reached a settlement that required Deloitte to pay $8.3 million and forgive $7 million to $10 million in unpaid invoices. School officials declined to discuss the project or specifics of the Deloitte lawsuit.  David Tokofsky, a former school board member who favored hiring Deloitte but was later critical of the firm’s performance, said the final product did not justify the cost.  “The moral is, if your car is 14 years old with 160,000 miles on it and is not falling apart, don’t go and get a new car,’’ Tokofsky said.  In 2009, Pennsylvania’s auditor general performed an examination entirely dedicated to Deloitte’s broad reach with the state, including 25 contracts. The 179-page report detailed problems with procurement and management of contracts at agencies ranging from welfare to the state liquor board. The liquor board, for example, awarded Deloitte a $26 million contract to upgrade the agency’s technology, but the system caused inventory shortages while the cost more than doubled, to $60 million.  The auditor’s review pointed back to state officials for better oversight, saying it “found numerous concerns, including poor accountability of contracts totaling $592.1 million.’’",

        "article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Pakistani military continues to nurture a broad range of militant groups as part of a three-decade strategy of using proxies against its neighbors and American forces in Afghanistan, but now some of the fighters it trained are questioning that strategy, a prominent former militant commander says.  The former commander said that he was supported by the Pakistani military for 15 years as a fighter, leader and trainer of insurgents until he quit a few years ago. Well known in militant circles but accustomed to a covert existence, he gave an interview to The New York Times on the condition that his name, location and other personal details not be revealed.  Militant groups, like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen and Hizbul Mujahedeen, are run by religious leaders, with the Pakistani military providing training, strategic planning and protection. That system was still functioning, he said.  The former commander’s account belies years of assurances by Pakistan to American officials since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that it has ceased supporting militant groups in its territory. The United States has given Pakistan more than $20 billion in aid over the past decade for its help with counterterrorism operations. Still, the former commander said, Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment has not abandoned its policy of supporting the militant groups as tools in Pakistan’s dispute with India over the border territory of Kashmir and in Afghanistan to drive out American and NATO forces.  “There are two bodies running these affairs: mullahs and retired generals,” he said. He named a number of former military officials involved in the program, including former chiefs of the intelligence service and other former generals. “These people have a very big role still,” he said.  Maj. Gen. Zaheer ul-Islam Abbasi, a former intelligence officer who was convicted of attempting a coup against the government of Benazir Bhutto in 1995 and who is now dead, was one of the most active supporters of the militant groups in the years after Sept. 11, the former commander said.  He said he saw General Abbasi several times: once at a meeting of Taliban and Pakistani militant leaders in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province as they planned how to confront the American military in Afghanistan; and twice in Mir Ali, which became the center for foreign militants in Pakistan’s tribal areas, including members of Al Qaeda.  There were about 60 people at the Taliban meeting in late 2001, soon after the Taliban government fell, the former commander said. Pakistani militant leaders were present, as were the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salam Zaeef, and Muhammad Haqqani, a member of the Haqqani network.  Several retired officials of Pakistan’s premier spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, were also there, he said, including a man known as Colonel Imam but who was actually Brig. Sultan Amir, a well-known trainer and mentor of militants, and General Abbasi. The militant groups divided Afghanistan into separate areas of operations and discussed how to “trip up America,” he said.  The Pakistani military still supports the Afghan Taliban in their fight to force out American and NATO forces from Afghanistan, he said, adding that he thought they would be successful.  The ISI also still supports other Pakistani militant groups, even some of those that have turned against the government, because the military still wants to keep them as tools for use against its archrival, India, he said. The military used a strategy of divide and rule, encouraging splits in the militant groups to weaken and control them, he said.  Although the military has lost control of many of the firebrand fighters, and has little influence over the foreign fighters in the tribal areas who belong to Al Qaeda — some of whom openly oppose the Pakistani government — it was reluctant to move against them, he said. Pakistan could easily kill the notoriously vicious militant leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, but chose not to, he said. “If someone gave me 20,000 rupees, I would do it,” he said, citing a price of about $235.  “The government is not interested in eliminating them permanently,” he said. “The Pakistani military establishment has become habituated to using proxies.” He added that there were many sympathizers in the military who still supported the use of militants.  Pakistan has 12,000 to 14,000 fully trained Kashmiri fighters, scattered throughout various camps in Pakistan, and is holding them in reserve to use if needed in a war against India, he said.  Yet Pakistan has been losing the fight for Kashmir, and most Kashmiris now want independence and not to be part of Pakistan or India, he said. Since Sept. 11, Pakistan has redirected much of its attention away from Kashmir to Afghanistan, and many Kashmiri fighters are not interested in that fight and have taken up India’s offer of an amnesty to go home.",

        "article": "A senior European official said: “We consider this a very important decision by the Russians. It shows that our disagreements with the Russians about the dangers of Iran’s nuclear program are tactical. Fundamentally, the Russians don’t want a nuclear Iran.”  At a time of growing tensions between Washington and Moscow, American officials are welcoming Russian support on the situation with Iran as a sign that there are still areas in which the two powers can cooperate.  Russia has been deeply reluctant to ratchet up sanctions against Iran in the Security Council, which is expected to vote on a new set of penalties against the country within the next week.  But American officials have been trying to create a commercial incentive for Russia to put pressure on Iran. One proposal the Bush administration has endorsed since late 2005 envisions having the Russians enrich Iran’s uranium in Russia. That creates the prospect of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in business for Russia, and a way to ensure that Iran receives only uranium enriched for use in power reactors, instead of for use in weapons.  Iran has rejected those proposals, saying it has the right to enrich uranium on its own territory.  The Russian Atomic Energy Agency, or Rosatom, is eager to become a major player in the global nuclear energy market. As Security Council action against Iran has gained momentum and Iran’s isolation increases, involvement with the Bushehr project may detract from Rosatom’s reputation.  In a flurry of public comments in the past month, Russian officials acknowledged that Russia was delaying the delivery of fuel to the reactor in the Iranian port city of Bushehr. It blamed the decision on the failure of Iran to pay what it owes on the project, not on concerns about nuclear proliferation.  But last month, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov informed some European officials that Russia had made a political decision not to deliver the fuel, adding that Russia would state publicly that the sole reason was financial, European officials said.  And then last week, a senior Iranian official confirmed in an interview that Mr. Ivanov had threatened Iran with an ultimatum: The fuel would be delivered only after Iran’s enrichment of uranium at Natanz was frozen.  Members of the Security Council are moving toward a vote this week on a draft resolution imposing further sanctions on Iran for its defiance of demands that it suspend enrichment activities and return to negotiations over its nuclear program.  The resolution focuses on the country’s arms exports, a leading Iranian bank and the elite Revolutionary Guards military force. It will reduce Iran’s access to foreign currency and isolate the bank, Bank Sepah, from international financing.  The United States State Department has granted visas to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and a retinue of 38 aides and security staff so that he can address the Security Council meeting.  Throughout the negotiations, the Russians tried to water down the resolution, a reflection of both their desire to avoid a backlash in Iran and their strong skepticism about the effectiveness of sanctions.  The pending resolution follows a similar one passed in December that required four months of negotiations, in large part because of Russia’s resistance. Russia’s support came only after an initial proposal, which would have imposed curbs on Bushehr, was dropped.  Russian officials have gone out of their way to not publicly link the Bushehr project and the crisis over Iran’s decision to forge ahead with producing enriched uranium, which, depending on the level of enrichment, can be used to produce electricity or make weapons.  In remarks on Sunday, for example, Mr. Ivanov said there should be no linkage between discussions on Iran’s nuclear program and the Bushehr plant. “It is a separate issue,” he told a conference of Russia’s Foreign and Defense Policies Council. He added, “All the work being done is under strict control of the International Atomic Energy Agency,” the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency based in Vienna.  He also cautioned against using possible nuclear sanctions for other purposes, saying, “We oppose attempts to use this issue as an instrument of pressure or interference in Iran’s internal affairs.”  But Mr. Ivanov also called on Iran to resolve outstanding questions with the agency about its nuclear program and to stop enriching uranium. The Russians have been pressing Iran to take some sort of pause in its uranium enrichment that might allow the Security Council sanction process to halt and bring Iran back to the negotiating table.  “The clock must be stopped; Iran must freeze uranium enrichment,” Mr. Ivanov said. “The U.N. Security Council will then take a break, too, and the parties would gather at the negotiating table.”  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has also called for a “pause,” noting that even a brief suspension of enrichment would be enough to get the United States to the negotiating table with Iran under an offer that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made in May.  The Bushehr nuclear project has a long history. For more than a decade, Russia has been working under a $1 billion contract to complete the plant, which began with Germany during the time of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. After the 1979 revolution, the project was halted; then the site was bombed by Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran. When Iran decided to complete the facility after the war ended, Germany, under pressure from the United States, refused to finish it, or even provide Moscow with the original blueprints.  The project — already eight years behind schedule — is now almost complete. Last year, Russia agreed to ship low-enriched fuel to the plant by March 2007 and start it in September, with electricity generation to start by November.  But in mid-February, Russia said Iran had not made the last two $25 million monthly payments after insisting that it be allowed to pay in euros instead of dollars. Russian officials cited a delay in the delivery of safety equipment from an unspecified third country as another reason for the decision.  Iranian officials denied that payments had been delayed. “Iran has had no delay whatsoever in making payments for the Bushehr nuclear power plant,” Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, was quoted by Iran’s state-run news agency IRNA as saying after the Russian claim.  “We would be crazy at this late date to endanger the project by not paying,” the official said. “There is no financial problem. The Russians want to use this issue as a bargaining chip.”  David E. Sanger and Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

        "article": "The two faces of Labour: I leave it to the reader to decide which is which  Speaking to two shadow ministers yesterday, they provided me with rather different takes on the continuing fallout from Unite leader Len McCluskey’s demand for Ed Miliband to purge the last remaining Blairites from his shadow cabinet.  “It’s getting totally out of hand now,” said one. “People are just wandering round, looking for scalps, trying to settle scores.”  The other had a more phlegmatic perspective. “This is an opportunity. Now we can start to push on and have the debate we’ve been ducking. There is no comfort zone any more.”  One thing both were agreed on. They felt relieved they no longer had to try to maintain the pretence of unity.  The “Happy Families narrative” as one Labour MP described it, had become a standing joke within the PLP and shadow cabinet. “The truth is, ideologically we’re more divided now than we have been since the 1980s,” said one shadow cabinet member.  And he’s right. From the point Neil Kinnock made his dramatic denunciation of the Militant Tendency at the Labour conference in Bournemouth in 1985, the Labour movement has had a broad unity of purpose. Yes, it had its factions. But in the main, they were marching in the same direction. Kinnock, Smith, Blair and Brown led a party that may not always have been singing from the same hymn sheet, but at least it attended the same church, and formed part of the same choir.  With the collapse of the New Labour consensus, a fissure has opened in Labour’s ranks. In broad terms, it is represented by two factions. Those who want to build on what they see as New Labour’s achievements. And those who want to see them consigned to the dustbin of history.  Driving the dustcart is Len McCluskey. The feeling among senior members of the Labour party – and not just the Blairites – is that the Unite leader and his union are now out of control. In fact, that’s not just a view held within the Labour Party, but more widely across the Labour movement. In his New Statesman interview McCluskey was asked about the TUC’s lukewarm response to his calls for a general strike. “Some unions, including Unite, might go away and talk among themselves about whether there is anything else they might wish to do, over and above the collective decision of the TUC,” was his pointed response.  “He’s basically looking to set up his own Labour movement,” said one Labour insider. “He’s going to have his own TUC, his own policy think-tank, his own activist base, his own campaign organisation and his own MPs.”  One of the other problems is McCluskey is not seen to be operating in isolation. A number of shadow cabinet members are becoming increasingly alarmed at the power axis he has been constructing with his close friend, and former flatmate, Tom Watson, who has formal responsibility for campaigns, and a strong informal influence over candidate selection.  “Look, there are a lot of things I’m unhappy with,” one shadow minister told me, “But I’ve got to be careful. I want to be reselected. If I get the wrong side of Tom and McCluskey I’m in trouble.” Another shadow cabinet member said “A lot of people now think Tom is becoming a problem for Ed. He’s just throwing his weight around, and its not helping.” Another shadow cabinet minister thought Watson was an asset, and still had an important role to play, but that it needed to be tightly defined. “We need Tom biting the ankles of the Tories, not his own MPs,” he said.  But the divisions in Labour’s ranks go deeper than personality. In each area of policy, there are now major fundamental disagreements about Labour’s direction of travel. And those disagreements are finally starting to bob to the surface.  On welfare there are those who advocate a radical realignment around areas such as sanctions, universality and contribution. And they face fierce opposition from those who see any movement in these areas as a capitulation in the face of Tory efforts to stigmatise those on welfare.  On the economy there is a major disagreement between those who feel Labour should be advocating a classical Keynesian alternative to the politics of austerity, and those who feel Labour should be demonstrating fiscal restraint. On the NHS there are those who feel Labour should be opponents of radical internal reform, and others who say they should be its champions.  Education – Free Schools. Defence – Trident. Europe – a referendum. Everywhere you look, if you bother to look, Labour is divided.  And these are not divisions based – as they were in the Blair/Brown years – around narrow differences of personality or frustrated ambition. These are basic divisions of ideology. Should Labour build on the foundations laid by Tony Blair? Or should the party stake its claim to a new plot of land, and start to build again from scratch?  That’s the fundamental question Ed Miliband has to answer. But to date, he’s been ducking it. He’s been happy to pen several New Labour obituaries. But when it comes to sketching out the alternative, his piece of paper – famously – remains blank.  “The next couple of months are going to decide things,” one shadow cabinet minister told me this morning. “This is it now. Ed’s going to have to make a decision. Who’s he going to line up with?”  Who indeed. The result of the next election probably hangs on Ed Miliband’s choice.

        "article": "Nearly two years after its first public hearings on the matter, the Federal Trade Commission finally weighed in with new native advertising guidelines for print and digital publishers.  While it does not require full disclosure that all sponsored content is an ad, the FTC is pushing for some variation of the word “advertisement” to appear near native ads that it deems could create confusion if consumers cannot discern quickly and simply that what they are viewing is a paid ad.  The FTC guidelines frown on the popular catch phrases such as “promoted by” or “sponsored by” that many publishers have favored when describing a native ad on their sites.  Basically, a native ad is content paid for by an advertiser but made to look very much like the journalistically generated content that publishers produce in digital format, but at times in print and even video games. The FTC said the primary guideline must be to avoid deceiving consumers.  “Advertisers should not use terms such as ‘Promoted’ or ‘Promoted Stories,’ which in this context are at best ambiguous and potentially could mislead consumers that advertising content is endorsed by a publisher site,” the FTC said in its guidelines released Dec. 22.  There are several other words that the FTC does not like.  “Depending on the context, consumers reasonably may interpret other terms such as ‘Presented by [X],’ ‘Brought to you by [X],’ ‘Promoted by [X]’ or ‘Sponsored by [X]’ to mean that a sponsoring advertiser funded or ‘underwrote’ but did not create or influence the content.”  The Interactive Advertising Bureau applauded some aspects of the new guidelines but said it has “concerns” that the FTC employed “granular dictating of word choice,” according to Brad Weltman, vice president of public policy at the IAB.  The FTC does allow a fair amount of leniency in other areas.  For instance, it does not automatically reject ads that have the same look and feel of the content, so long as consumers would not be deceived. It points to a hypothetical running-shoe manufacturer whose native ad could appear on a financial news site without requiring disclosures, since consumers were not likely to be confused into thinking the shoe information is connected to the financial editorial.  Other areas could get a pass as well. “Native ads can also be integrated into content including entertainment programming and video games,” the FTC said.  “In some instances, consumers are likely to understand that a sponsoring advertiser paid for the product integration. In other instances, a disclosure may be necessary to avoid deceiving consumers.”  No penalties for violating the guidelines were disclosed — so far.  Joe Mohen, the ex-CEO of Nylon Media who has bought and sold a number of digital operations, said he predicted that the FTC would only follow up with “spot enforcement of the most egregious violations.”  “I could see more enforcement in the area of pharmaceutical ads, where misuse of that could have a highly negative impact,” Mohen said. “But for other publishers in fashion, beauty or entertainment, there is not much of a Chinese wall to begin with.”",

        "article": "WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney is seen by more voters in three battleground states as a strong leader after his dominant debate performance last week, but perceptions that the economy is improving remain a buttress for President Obama as the 2012 campaign comes down to its final weeks.  The latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll, of likely voters in the three states, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, found no sharp movement after the debate and the news last Friday that the unemployment rate in September had dropped below 8 percent for the first time since Mr. Obama took office.  But the poll suggested that Mr. Romney had gained strength in a number of ways since last month and that Mr. Obama’s best defense is the somewhat brighter economic outlook and the fact that voters continue to relate to him more than they do to his opponent.  Mr. Romney’s backers now support him more fervently than before. He is running stronger in particular among those who say they are paying especially close attention to the race. He retains his dominance on the issue of handling the federal budget deficit and seems to have stabilized his showing on handling of the economy.  About two-thirds of the voters in each state said Mr. Romney has strong leadership qualities, more than said the same of the president.  “The debate made me feel better about” Mr. Romney, one poll respondent, Paula Gregory, 37, a clerical manager for a construction firm who lives in Highlands Ranch, Colo., said in a follow-up interview. “I had more specific information from him and he had real rebuttals to accusations that had been made, most specifically about his tax plan.”  But Mr. Obama holds a slim advantage in Virginia and Wisconsin, and remains tied with Mr. Romney in Colorado, perhaps, in part, because voters are growing increasingly hopeful that the country’s economy is turning around. That conclusion follows last Friday’s report showing the unemployment rate falling to 7.8 percent, the first dip below 8 percent since January 2009. In Virginia, 42 percent of voters say the economy is getting better, up from 24 percent in July; in Colorado the figure is 37 percent, up 11 points in three months.  The positive economic news appears to have buffered the president in Virginia, Wisconsin and Colorado from the substantial improvement in Mr. Romney’s national poll numbers over the past week. The three battleground polls suggest that challenges remain for Mr. Romney in the next 26 days even as his supporters express new confidence about their candidate.  “It’s slow and steady, but the job market is growing,” Thomas Broderick, 50, a doctor from Madison, Wis., said in a follow-up interview. “Also, from what I see around my city, the housing market is better. People are able to sell their homes. Houses are being built. If the economy were in the tank, perhaps it would be harder to vote for Obama.”  In Virginia and Wisconsin, Mr. Obama maintains double-digit leads over his rival when voters are asked which candidate cares about their needs and who would do a better job for the middle class. The preference for Mr. Obama on those issues is smaller in Colorado, a state where the two candidates have been virtually tied for months.  The president’s support is built on strengths that have been evident for months. In the two states where he holds an advantage overall, Mr. Obama has consistently outperformed Mr. Romney on a series of issues, including international affairs, health care and Medicare.  And in those states, Mr. Obama’s months of advertising attacking Mr. Romney’s character appears to have worked. The president maintains significant leads over Mr. Romney on the issue of trust and honesty. Nearly 60 percent of voters in Virginia and Wisconsin say Mr. Obama is trustworthy and honest; just 47 percent say the same of Mr. Romney.  Suzanne DiLisi, 44, a restaurant worker from Marshall, Va., said Wednesday that she planned to vote for Mr. Obama because of concerns that Mr. Romney would not help lower-income people like herself.  “Financially speaking, I believe Romney will cut the debt,” Ms. DiLisi said. “But he will do it at the expense of people who are already suffering.” She pointed to Mr. Romney’s comment that 47 percent of Americans are dependent on government.  “Those remarks, they were awful,” she said. “As president, you literally have to work for the very poor to the very rich.”  Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Megan Thee-Brenan from New York. Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting from New York.",

        "article": "Autumn Veatch described the chaos after the Beech A35 aircraft hit the side of the mountain on Saturday and her amazing two-day journey to rescue.  \"I got out. There was fire. That's how my face got burned. My hair was burning. ... And -- my immediate response was to go and try to help them out. Because they were alive. They were alive. They were both screaming,\" she said.  Autumn said she realized that she couldn't get to her grandmother, Sharon Bowman, who was on the other side of the airplane. She thought if she could get her grandfather, Leland Bowman, out first, then his wife could follow them to safety.  She tried and tried, she said, until she realized there was no saving him.  \"I was trying to pull him out and I just couldn't do it. There was a lot of fire. And I am a small person,\" she said.  The plane was found extensively burned when searchers arrived after making their way through the rugged, nearly vertical terrain, according to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office. The two bodies were still inside.  Autumn hiked out of the rugged North Cascades Mountains on Monday, two days after the crash, covered in burns and bruises.  She told CNN she thought she was going to die of hypothermia.  \"I was freezing,\" she said.  Autumn recounted how when she was a fourth grader she and her father used to watch shows about surviving in the outdoors. After deciding to head for help, she went downhill, a decision searchers say was a factor in saving her life. She could hear the sounds of a highway, but that faded. She knew she needed to find some sort of running water -- not only to drink.  \"Water always leads to civilization,\" she said.  She came upon a stream, and followed the flow. It became a river, and on the second day it led to a bridge. She walked up an adjacent trail to a parking lot where there was one empty car.  She went back to the highway and stood suffering by the roadside, trying to get people to pull over, but cars kept passing.  Finally, after an hour, she went back to the parking lot, as she sat in the rain with her sweater pulled over her, another car pulled in.  The two men inside took her to a store in Mazama, near the Canadian border. They bought her a sandwich and one of the men called police. He handed her the phone and she described her horrific ordeal.  Autumn developed rhabdomyolysis, a muscle disorder, during her ordeal, but suffered no life-threatening injuries, said Scott Graham, chief executive of Three Rivers Hospital. Rhabdomyolysis is often caused by an injury that damages skeletal muscle, according to the National Library of Medicine. Fibers from the damaged muscle enter the bloodstream and can cause kidney damage, but recovery is possible with treatment.  She had burns on her hands and was also extremely dehydrated and exhausted.  Autumn had been visiting her mother in northern Montana when her grandparents offered to fly her home to Washington.  The flight from Kalispell became very cloudy and there was one near miss before the accident, she said.  Visibility went to near zero, she recalled, before her grandfather made the decision to fly higher.  She said she was hunched down and she could only see white as she looked ahead out the windshield.  Then it was light. Then trees.  \"The impact itself didn't really hurt me. But the fire did,\" she said.  The first day was very difficult. She blamed herself for what happened.  \"They mattered a lot to me,\" she said, even though she had only known them for a few years.  She cried a lot that day. Not only did she have the guilt of being the sole survivor, it was also raining. She was soaked. She tried to sleep near the crash site. She's not sure if she did.  Autumn said she thought about a text to her boyfriend. It was a joke she had written during the flight, during some turbulence.  She had written, \"If I die, just remember that I love you.\"  Hours later, freezing, unable to feel her feet, feeling hopeless, she decided she couldn't die there.  Going down the mountain was tough. She had to cross the water several times to find ways to get through the thick woods. Twice she slipped on the rocks and tumbled into the frigid water.  And there were waterfalls. Rather than go over with the water at the first one, she scaled down a 20-foot wall in her Converse shoes, her sweater and her \"burned-up pants.\" The next waterfall was only 10 feet down.  She slept the second night in a sand bank and woke up covered with bug bites.  \"It's weird. I never thought I had it in me to go through all that stuff. I'm kind of a huge wimp,\" she said.  Autumn said that in the past she's also been a negative person. She's an introvert who struggled with depression.  \"This really gave me a newfound respect for life,\" she said. \"I have never loved being alive more.\"  I was the sole survivor: 4 stories of plane crash survival  CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Bellingham, Washington, and Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta.

        "article": "Can the sluggish economy really justify the prices investors are currently paying for stocks? That's the question on traders' minds these days, and it certainly applies to real estate companies, which have seen their shares roughly double since the market's financial crisis nadir in March, easily trumping the S&P 500's mere 57% gain. There are fewer bargains in real estate investment trusts than before the rally, but REITs that hold apartment towers, hotels and self-storage units provide tempting opportunities, says analyst Mike Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.  REITs were perilously close to the financial crisis: They own property, depend heavily on debt and cannot retain their earnings. As property values plummeted and banks pulled back on lending, REIT shares nosedived. As the bond and stock markets have reopened to REITs, investor poured back in to the sector. That's left many investors wondering if they missed their opportunity, and rightly so, says Salinsky.  Most, if not all, apartment, hotel and storage REITs will see sales and profits decline this year and next. Rents are falling faster than prices, so the investment yield on companies' property portfolios (which is, to some extent, what you get if you buy shares today) is dropping too. Add to that a volatile stock market, and the likelihood of further dividend reductions and the industry's prospects look dicey to some shareholders.  Salinsky is bullish, anyway. He argues that prices will likely go even higher as public companies, with less debt and access to the capital markets, snatch up bargain properties from banks and troubled private developers. So far, many of those properties are being withheld by banks, who are loathe to write down their assets, and Salinksy believes some people's fantasy of a distressed real estate glut won't happen at all. But with the bond markets lending freely again, REITs have access to cheaper debt to finance anything that looks attractive, which should boost their investment returns. Rents and property values will reach bottom at some point and start climbing again, especially as unemployment shrinks. A pick up in business travel will translate into growth for hotels, while there'll be little competitive pressure from new entrants.  Salinsky tells investors to be selective. Some REITs still have high levels of debt that could run them into trouble. One apartment company he likes is Camden Property Trust ( CPT - news - people ), a Houston-based firm of moderate size that has a solid balance sheet and room to grow. Salinsky also likes Essex Property Trust ( ESS - news - people ) and Home Properties ( HME - news - people ), also relatively small companies. Essex is concentrated on the West Coast with a sterling balance sheet, while Home primarily has buildings on the East Coast.  In hotels, Salinsky favors Hospitality Properties Trust ( HPTPRA - news - people ) and LaSalle Hotel Properties ( LHO - news - people ). Hospitality owns about 300 hotels in North America, most of them with name brands like Marriott, Radisson and Intercontinental. LaSalle has just 31 properties but a good track record. Public Storage ( PSA - news - people ), which rents self-storage units, is also on Salinsky's \"buy\" list.  Investors should dump two apartment REITs, say Salinksy. Apartment Investment and Management Company ( AIVPRG - news - people ) (Aimco) and Post Properties ( PPS - news - people ) are too risky for the current environment.",

If you didn’t notice the trippy textile in the exhibition itself (which opened Oct. 1 and runs through June 3, 2012), you might have caught the collection in LACMA's gift shop –- though we have to confess all of our attention at the time was focused on procuring one of the cool-looking posters (adapted from a Ray Eames design that originally appeared on the cover of the May 1943 issue of \"Arts & Architecture\").  But, a few weeks later we couldn’t have missed it as we walked past Bedhead’s 3rd Street flagship boutique, where a pajama-clad family of four Midcentury Modern mannequins had taken up residence in the storefront window display (Look! Ultra-modern flair for baby!), posed alongside two of the museum's street light pole banners.  Even if you're not familiar with the name, you're more than likely familiar with the work of the architect and interior designer László (1900-1993), a Hungarian emigre who liked to oversee every aspect of his projects -- not just drafting architectural blueprints, but textile design, furniture, lamps and the like. His contributions to the landscape of Los Angeles and beyond included stores like Bullock’s Wilshire, Robinson’s and Orbach’s, and celebrity clients like Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor earned him the nickname \"the millionaire's architect.\"  According to Bedhead Pajamas’ CEO and designer Renee Claire Bertrand, the collaboration project began when Wendy Kaplan, head of LACMA’s Decorative Arts and Design department, asked Bertrand to select a textile from the museum’s “California Design” exhibition to use on an array of gift shop merchandise, and she chose the Laszlo upholstery textile design, which according to the Bobbye Tigerman essay in the book accompanying the exhibit, \"drew on the biomorphic shapes of Hans Arp and Joan Miró.\" (Purists take note: according to Bertrand, the version that appears on the merchandise has been tweaked ever-so-slightly from the original, making it slightly smaller in scale and slightly brighter in tone.)  The result is a range of pieces that includes men’s, women’s and children’s pajamas, T-shirts, boxer shorts, table runners and napkins, which have been available through the LACMA gift shop and Bedhead’s bricks-and-mortar 3rd Street store since Oct. 1.  (If you're not nearby, the pajamas are currently in stock at both Bedhead's and LACMA's websites. The women's pieces are a 95% cotton and 5% Lycra blend with lavender piping, the men's are 100% cotton sateen with brown piping, with retail prices ranging from $128 to $142 -- depending on where you buy them and whether you're a LACMA member.)  “The collaborative products have been selling remarkably well, which points to the possibility of doing numerous projects of this kind, with a variety of museums,” Bertrand told us. “This show is going to travel the globe and it’s hugely popular.”  Although Bedhead is already known for the surfeit of boldly patterned PJs it creates, the pairing of the icon of Midcentury design is an especially good fit given that it keys into the overall vibe of the 3rd Street store interior, which includes a 10-foot-in-diameter Herman Miller conference table, George Nelson dining table, Dutch modern industrial chairs and a pair of 1930s Alvar Aalto bent wood shelving units.

        "article": "It’s no secret that women can have a hard time breaking into the tech sector. But when Nofar Diamant and Dana Gutkind interviewed for their jobs at Perion Network, a Holon, Israel-based technology company, they were snapped up immediately. They didn’t even need to sell their experience—which was convenient, since they’re not allowed to talk about it.  That’s because the two women are both alumni of the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF’s) elite Unit 8200, which is a leader in areas like electronic intelligence gathering and cybersecurity. People who have served in the unit are among the most sought-after hires in the tech world.  Those who work in 8200 have passed rigorous testing and security clearances, often having been spotted for possible recruitment in high school. Because military service is compulsory in Israel—men serve for three years and women serve for roughly two years— Unit 8200 has its pick of a broad and impressive talent pool.  The unit has become legendary in tech circles. Business Insider called it the “greatest tech school in the world.” The advanced training that soldiers receive there has produced an array of successful startup founders and employees, and the unit even has its own alumni association and annual conference. Last year, Perion sponsored the conference in an effort to put the company in front of the pool of 8200 alumni looking for their next gigs. Perion also encourages its employees to recruit friends and family members who might be a good fit for the firm—including any 8200 alumni who might be on their contact lists.  The Josef Mandelbaum, CEO of Perion, which helps online publishers and app developers increase revenues and customer engagement, puts it this way: The Israeli army has already done the screening and training. Not to mention that that the unit’s technology “is 10 years ahead, from a technical standpoint, from what you see as consumers today,” he says. So, even if they can’t talk about what they did, execs like Mandelbaum know that some of the knowledge and expertise honed by the former soldiers’ advanced training is bound to rub off in areas like software engineering and team leadership. He says most of Perion’s current platforms and security measures have had 8200 alumni involved in development.  “Those problem-solving skills, as well as leadership and managerial skills—I’d hire 8200 graduates over a Harvard or Stanford graduate for those types of jobs, any day,” he says.  An avenue for women in tech  Mandelbaum won’t disclose how many of those alumni he’s been able to hire beyond saying the number is “in the tens.” He also admits a “personal bias” toward hiring women to foster diversity at his company, saying that since he took the helm at Perion in 2010, the company has shifted from fewer than 30% women to roughly double that ratio (56%).  Now 23 years old, Diamant has worked at Perion for three years. She says that her time in the IDF’s Unit 8200 gave her leadership skills as well as technical training. The quality assurance engineer says she didn’t feel as though being a woman was a disadvantage during her service—in fact, it helped teach her to overcome typical pressures women face to be unrelentingly “nice.”  “It helped me to be more mature and distinguish between being nice and doing what I really think will be best,” she says.  In Gutkind’s case, the 38-year-old software engineer says that her service helped foster an intense attention to detail and affinity for planning. “The same way you don’t start building a building without a specific plan, we now do software work the same way. It all started in 8200,” she says.  Of course, there are still adaptations that need to be made in the shift to a civilian workplace, Mandelbaum says. The business world is more about consensus-building than making unilateral decisions. That can be frustrating to people with a military background, who may be accustomed to making the call themselves, even in situations that could have grave consequences, he says. Army roles often have short-term focus—complete the task at hand and move on. At Perion, as at many companies, much of the work requires long-term thinking.  But, most of all, the employee needs to be a good fit for the culture. Mandelbaum looks for great skills and people others like working with. He also finds that 8200 alumni seem to have an affinity for ongoing learning and teaching others—other qualities he values.  “There are always going to be good times and bad times a company goes through,” he says. “If you have that attitude, more often than not we’ll come out stronger and better.”",

We have six of them in today’s puzzle, if you don’t count the central revealer at 38 Across.  Gerry Wildenberg is making his New York Times debut with today’s puzzle, and we welcome him. I thought this was a charming idea. Who would have thought there would be gold in our puzzle? The GOLD NUGGETs are kind of “anagrammed” in each spot, in the sense that the letters GOLD are all in different positions in the six spots, which is a nice touch, but which must have really been a heavy constraint when building the grid. I think Mr. Wildenberg’s puzzle could have been strengthened by better fill (I’m looking at you, RIATA, AAR, NLERS, and particularly UNSTOW) and my expectation of Tuesday ease and smoothness was a trifle disappointed by clues like GAM for “Group of whales.” GAM is correct; it’s just that on a Tuesday, I was expecting the more familiar “pod.”  But let’s not linger there; there is gold to be found in Mr. Wildenberg’s puzzle. I liked BOGEYING, SUN RA, OLD LINE, SO AND SO and SLIP SLOP, along with its clue “Twaddle.” It’s hard to wedge in longer entries with this particular grid set up, but without it, there might not have been this much gold.  Clue(s) of the Day for me were “Nothing doing?” for IDLE and “Gave a cattle call?” for LOWED.  Like almost all puzzles that contain triply-checked letters, like the shaded ones here, this puzzle includes some vocabulary that is not as crisp or clean as in puzzles with regular checking. That’s just the nature of the beast. I thought this puzzle’s theme was cool enough to justify the AAR, the LLD’S, the SSE, the ENS, etc. The grid really doesn’t have anything awful, and overall it’s about as clean as it can be, given the constraints.  Though I’ve done crossword puzzles sporadically all my life, about four years ago I started doing them a bit more seriously than I had in the past. It didn’t take me long to realize that I would never be very good unless I improved my knowledge of rap singers, American Idol winners and European rivers, to mention just a few of my areas of ignorance. Since I was unwilling to study these and diverse other topics, I resigned myself to remaining a mediocre (though slowly improving) solver. But then, somehow, I discovered the world of crossword construction.  This would be a new challenge. So I bought Patrick Berry’s book on construction and got started. It wasn’t long before, feeling a bit discouraged, I wrote to Patrick noting that he claimed anyone could learn to construct puzzles, yet fewer than one hundred New York Times debuts occurred each year. Yet thousands of his book were selling. Despite my misgivings and rejections, I persisted and soon got some L.A. Times publications. Today is my New York Times debut. I thank Patrick Berry for his book, Nancy Salomon for her invaluable mentoring, Rick Norris for my first crossword publication, and Will Shortz for putting me in The New York Times.  Today’s puzzle is actually the second of mine accepted by Will. The present version seems to have been edited sometime after its acceptance, as much of the fill in the NE corner and adjacent areas looks new to me. One word I wish I had been allowed to use is “pgdns” (seldom used keys), which can be found in the singular on your keyboard.  I’ve never been taken to a fast-food restaurant on a date, but 1 Down reminded me of this classic:",

And defensive coordinator Vic Fangio made him wait 15 minutes more.  Smith didn’t play in the first quarter Sunday. The linebacker came into the game against the New York Giants on the 49ers’ first defensive series of the second quarter, and remained in action pretty much the rest of the way.  “It was exciting,” Smith said. “It felt like the first day of school.”  There was some concern that Smith, who was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a few days before the season for violations of the league’s personal-conduct policy, might be rusty. He was allowed to work out at the team facility, but as Fangio pointed out, he hadn’t seen any game action for a very long time.  “At first, you’re not going to be as good as when you left off,” Smith said. “But as the game went on, it got better and better and I got better and better.”  Smith’s extensive play came, in part, because of the mysterious benching of Ahmad Brooks, who started the game but was benched in the second quarter. Head coach Jim Harbaugh said Brooks — the savior of the victory over the Saints — was “working through something,” and would not elaborate.  The 49ers were able to get more pressure on Eli Manning, sacking him twice and hitting him seven times. Smith, who had two quarterback hits, believes the increased pass rush led to Manning throwing five interceptions.  “I sure hope so,” he said.  Defensive tackle Justin Smith was happy to have his protege back on the field beside him.  “They protect differently when he’s out there,” Justin Smith said. “They definitely change their scheme up. You’ve got to account for a guy like that and what he brings.  “It’s kind of like having a No. 1 wide receiver. You know they’re going to roll coverage to him.”  The 49ers have only 17 sacks. Coming into Sunday’s game, they were tied for 25th in the league in that category. Smith has 42 career sacks, including 19.5 in 2012.  But he has missed almost an entire season of his young career. He sat out five games last year, after entering alcohol rehabilitation, and the nine games this year. The 49ers are happy to have Smith back, but they have learned they can’t predict his future.  “I thought he did some good things,” Harbaugh said cautiously.  No. 99 was back on the field. And the Niners’ future opponents have to be concerned.  Ann Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.",

Too much social networking could be damaging your brain.  An Oxford University scientist has warned that sites like Facebook, MySpace and Twitter shorten attention spans, encourage instant gratification and make young people more self-centered.  Millions log onto these Web sites every day, with many people depending on them for their social life, leading Baroness Susan Greenfield to warn that repeated exposure could lead to the longer-term rewiring of the brain.  \"We know how small babies need constant reassurance that they exist,\" she told the UK's Daily Mail newspaper.  \"My fear is that these technologies are infantilizing the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights, who have a small attention span and live for the moment.\"  Facebook, which has more than 150 million users, allows friends to keep in touch with each other by posting photographs, status updates and notes.  Sites like Twitter, with six million users, let people post short, text message-type information about themselves for friends to see.  These Web sites have grown in popularity in recent years but an increasing number of neuroscientists and psychologists fear they could do more harm than good.  Greenfield believes computer games and fast-paced TV shows are also contributing to the creation of a generation with poor attention spans.  And she pointed to research showing people with autism find it hard to communicate, but are comfortable using computers.  \"It is hard to see how living this way on a daily basis will not result in brains, or rather minds, different from those of previous generations,\" she said.  \"Of course, we do not know whether the current increase in autism is due more to increased awareness and diagnosis of autism, or whether it can - if there is a true increase - be in any way linked to an increased prevalence among people of spending time in screen relationships. Surely it is a point worth considering.\"",

        "article": "BÃ©atrice de GÃ©a for The New York Times  At the Gansevoort resort in Turks and Caicos. More Photos »  GRATEFUL for rain on a Caribbean vacation? You bet I was. And you might have been, too, had you just escaped from a mob of bronzed bodies dancing under the stars in whipped-up, blissed-out unison to a 1980s disco hit.  “Gimme, gimme your heart ...” they sang to “Hands Up,” madly waving their arms. Then, suddenly, the purple sky opened and a hard rain sent them scurrying to a covered bar.  Hours after checking into the Club Med in Turks and Caicos, I had yet to acclimate. As I would quickly learn, this particular Xanadu was an all-or-nothing proposition. Take, for instance, the two clocks at the reception desk: one has the correct time; the other, with a plaque beneath it that reads “Club Med Times,” is an hour late. The latter, a receptionist explained, is the official time at the resort, so that guests can enjoy an extra hour of sunlight each day. Never mind that this is not the correct time anywhere else on the Turks and Caicos archipelago.  Inside the gates of this 84-acre compound, fantasy reigns.  As a veteran solo traveler, I’d come to Club Med Turkoise to see how one of the last outposts of the singles resort scene was faring. In its heyday, “Club Med” might as well have been spelled “meat market.” A 1970 article in The New York Times described a Club Med in Martinique as rife with semi-nude swingers and a sensual atmosphere “that middle age should not be forced to endure.”  Flash forward to 2012. The image on the cover of this year’s Club Med brochure? A mother gazing into the eyes of a baby. More than half of Club Med’s 80 resorts have clubs for children, and dozens have a “baby welcome program,” where the draw is not a stiff drink upon arrival, but a bottle warmer.  For solo travelers, this G-rated makeover underscores a broader problem: the travel industry is just not that into you. Singles typically have to pay supplement fees on cruise ships and endure hotels where the Jacuzzi is little more than a kiddie pool. Sure, there are singles tours, fitness boot camps and other adventures that facilitate mingling. But if you’re like me — not looking for romance, but simply yearning for a lazy Caribbean escape — the options are few. At most places you’ll feel as if you’re on someone else’s family vacation or, worse, honeymoon.  The Turks and Caicos property is one of only five Club Méditerranée resorts whose clientele is limited to adults 18 and older. To see just how singles-friendly the resort still is (friends and I passed through it at one point or another after college), I booked a room for a couple of days. I then spent a night at the newer, luxe Gansevoort Turks and Caicos. Part of the hotel chain often synonymous with celebrity and night life, it seemed like a place that should suit a solo traveler.  I arrived at the village, as Club Med resorts are called, on a November afternoon in a van carrying one other guest, a blond, affable man from Manhattan. As we rolled up to the curb, a few employees swayed side-to-side in a slow-motion welcome dance. A plastic bracelet was snapped on my wrist, guaranteeing me all-inclusive drinks, food, fun. In a few hours, there would be an orientation for new guests, where advice like “do not wear suntan lotion or drink alcohol before using the trapeze” would be imparted.  In the meantime, a tanned Frenchman escorted me to one of the village’s colorful bungalows. Opened in 1984, this Club Med was one of the first resorts on the island of Providenciales, and many of the rooms, while clean, recall the village’s spartan days. My “deluxe” room was large, though the mattress and linens were thin; the toilet felt as if it were in a broom closet. (I paid $885 for two nights, though, in general, spending a week is less expensive per night.)  I slipped into a tank top and cutoffs. I need not have bothered. The dress code is bikini. The must-have accessory is plastic beer cup.  STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM is a reporter for the Styles Section of The Times.",

        "article": "Detlev Guenzel was found guilty of \"murder motivated by sexual lust and disturbing the peace of the dead\". (AAP)  A German former police officer has been sentenced to eight years and six months in jail for killing a willing victim he met on a website for cannibalism fetishists.  In the macabre case which captured international headlines, presiding Judge Birgit Wiegand said the defendant, Detlev Guenzel, was guilty of \"murder motivated by sexual lust and disturbing the peace of the dead\".  The defendant, wearing a bright pink dress shirt and cargo trousers, sat impassively with his arms folded as the verdict was read out to the packed courtroom in the eastern city of Dresden yesterday.  Guenzel, 57, went on trial in August over the killing in November 2013 of Polish-born Wojciech Stempniewicz, a business consultant, at the defendant's home, a bed-and-breakfast inn in a mountain town near the Czech border.  The court found that Guenzel had cut the body into small pieces in a slaughter chamber he built in his cellar and buried them in his garden. But there was no evidence that he ate any part of his victim.  State attorneys had sought 10 and a half years in prison for the defendant, a trim, soft-spoken father of three adult children whom neighbours described as friendly, generous and unfailingly polite.  He smiled briefly at his daughter before taking his seat in the courtroom to hear the verdict.  Lawyers representing the family of Stempniewicz, 59, had requested a 15-year sentence, usually the maximum in a murder case.  But prosecutors said they stopped short of this demand because Stempniewicz had long harboured a sexually charged death wish, a line of argument that Wiegand said the court had accepted.  \"He wanted to be killed to make his fantasy come true,\" she said during a two-hour-long reading of the verdict.  The men came across each other in October 2013 on a website for slaughter and cannibalism fantasies billed as the \"#1 site for exotic meat\" and boasting more than 3,000 registered members.  A click on a box allows participants to say if they would like to go beyond the realm of the imagination.  Guenzel, a three-decade veteran of the police force, retracted a confession he made to detectives soon after Stempniewicz's death in which he said he killed him by cutting his throat.  His defence team argued that Stempniewicz had hanged himself in Guenzel's custom-designed \"S&M studio\" before Guenzel took a knife, then an electric saw, to the gagged-and-bound man.  Investigators testified that they could not definitively determine the cause of death due to the state of the corpse.  However Wiegand sharply rejected the notion Stempniewicz had suddenly changed his mind about wanting to be killed.  \"You don't change such preferences from one day to the next,\" she said.  \"The notion he would have said, 'then I'll just kill myself -- the main thing is that I'll be slaughtered' is simply improbable.\"  Guenzel was married to his male partner for 10 years in a civil union at the time of the events, but said they divorced before the trial.  The case exposed a murky online scene of gory sexual kinks that usually remain pure fantasy.  Guenzel and Stempniewicz had had extensive contact online and by telephone before finally arranging the fatal date on November 4.  Their emails bore the title \"Schlachtfest\", the German word for a country feast after the slaughter of a pig. Guenzel called himself \"Caligula 31\", Stempniewicz logged on as \"Heszla-Longpig\".  A 50-minute video Guenzel made was played during the trial and showed him at one point covered in blood as he mutilated the corpse, muttering, \"I never thought I would sink so low.\"  He reportedly broke down in tears when the footage was shown, telling Wiegand: \"I don't claim I'm entirely innocent -- it was the biggest mistake of my life. But I am not a murderer.\"  Wiegand said the court found the expression of faint regret seen in the video made it unlikely Guenzel would repeat such an act.  She said this differed from the infamous case of German cannibal Armin Meiwes, who admitted to killing, mutilating and eating the flesh of a lover in 2001 after meeting him on the Internet via an advertisement looking for a \"slaughter victim\".  He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006.  Do you have any news photos or videos?",

        "article": "Researchers at several universities reviewed about 8,100 images in 296 children's books. The books were all Caldecott Medal winners and honorees from 1938 to 2008. The Caldecott awards are given annually to the artist of the most distinguished American picture book for children. Researchers categorized images as containing either a natural environment, such as a jungle or forest; a built environment, such as a house, school or office; or a modified environment, such as a mowed lawn, park or farm field. They also identified wild and domestic animals. Findings published in February's Sociological Inquiry:  •Early in the study period, built environments were the primary environments in about 35% of images. By the end of the study, they were primary environments about 55% of the time.  •Early in the study, natural environments were the primary environments about 40% of the time; by the end, roughly 25%.  Images of wild animals and domestic animals declined dramatically over time, says lead author Al Williams of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \"The natural environment and wild animals have all but disappeared in these books.\"  Co-author Chris Podeschi of Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania says, \"This is just one sample of children's books, but it suggests there may be a move away from the natural world as the population is increasingly isolated from these settings. This could translate into less concern about the environment.\"  Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods, says this study and others suggest \"a physical disassociation with the natural world …. Nature experience isn't a panacea, but it does help children and the rest of us on many levels of health and cognition. I believe that as parents learn more about the disconnect, they'll want to seek more of that experience for their children, including the joy and wonder that nature has traditionally contributed to children's literature.\"  Psychologist Susan Linn, author of The Case for Make Believe, says the research supports growing concerns about kids' lack of connection with nature. \"Time in green space is essential to children's mental and physical health. And the health of the planet depends on a generation of children who love and respect the natural world enough to protect it from abuse and degradation.\"",

(AAP)  Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican's economy minister, says hundreds of millions of euros have been found \"tucked away\" in accounts of various Holy See departments.  The former Archbishop of Sydney said the discovery meant overall Vatican finances were in better shape than previously thought.  \"We have discovered that the situation is much healthier than it seemed, because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet,\" he wrote in an article for Britain's Catholic Herald Magazine, to be published today, Reuters reports.  \"It is important to point out that the Vatican is not broke ... the Holy See is paying its way, while possessing substantial assets and investments.\"  Pell did not suggest any wrongdoing but said Vatican departments had long had \"an almost free hand\" in managing their finances.  The Australian heads the new Secretariat for the Economy, having been transferred by Pope Francis to Rome as an outsider to oversee the Vatican's often-muddled finances after decades of control by Italians.  Pell has since set about establishing new standards in financial ethics and accountability.  In a letter his office sent to all Vatican departments last month, Pell said that starting next year each department will have to enact \"sound and efficient financial management policies\" and prepare financial reports that will be reviewed by a major international auditing firm.

        "article": "Wow Air, the roughly three-year old discount air carrier, is going where few other ultra low cost airlines have gone: across the Atlantic. And if all goes according to plan, it's going to do it much cheaper than anyone else.  The budget airline, which is based in Iceland, announced last week that it will begin flying passengers non-stop from both Boston and Baltimore to Reykjavik, Iceland for as little as $99 each way. The airline will also offer one-stop flights from the two U.S. cities to London and Copenhagen, starting at $228 for a round trip. The airline will begin offering the flights next March.  \"Paying even $200 for a one-way flight to, say, London, is unheard of,\" said Tom Parson, the CEO of bestfares.com, which tracks airline pricing. \"It just doesn't exist.\"  The incredibly low ticket prices are real, but don't expect them to last forever. \"Those are definitely opening, introductory fares,\" said Skuli Mogensen, Wow Air's chief executive. \"On an occasional basis we hope to be able to introduce similar fares, but those very aggressive. We wouldn't be talking if I had introduced prices more commonly seen in the market, would we?\"  But the airline's commitment is to offer the cheapest ticket for every route the airline flies, including transatlantic routes, Mogensen said. The prices Wow Air offers will vary by season, and depend on a number of other factors, including fuel prices and flight vacancies.  Wow Air's cheapest transatlantic offerings, by month, looked something like this on Tuesday afternoon, according to the airlines' website.  By comparison, the average price of a round-trip plane ticket between Boston and Reykjavik in March of 2015 is just under $600, by Parson's estimate. A single stop round-trip ticket between Boston and London runs about $770, while a non-stop ticket costs roughly $800.  How does Wow Air expect to pull this off? For one, by operating like all other ultra discount carries. A ticket on Wow Air will come with little more than a seat, mini-tray table, and 11 pound carry-on. Everything else will cost extra. A carry-on will cost an extra $29 when booked online, or an additional $48 when done so at the airport. Checked luggage will set one back a bit more—an extra $48 online or $67 at check-in. And extra leg room, pre-assigned seats, and, of course, food will rack up the bill, too.  But unlike Spirit Airlines, which is famous for squeezing passengers' knees, Wow Air won't skimp quite as much on leg room. The seat pitch, the distance between two seats, is between 30 and 36 inches on the Airbus A320 aircrafts flown by the airline, said Svanhvít Fridriksdóttir, Wow Air's director of communications. Most pitch sizes are about 31 inches, and many discount carrier pitch sizes are less than 30 inches. Spirit Airlines', for instance, is 28 inches.  Wow Air also expects to save money by operating as efficiently as possible. The company relies heavily on online sales and marketing, for instance, which allows it to skip the cost of middlemen. It also operates few airplanes—only four currently—but maximizes their utility. \"We have extremely good aircraft utilization,\" said Mogensen. \"Within one 24-hour cycle, a single airplane will fly from Iceland to Boston, back to Iceland, and continue to London, and then back to Iceland, each time full of passengers.\"  And Wow Air expects to fill all of its planes, a feat few if any airlines operating transatlantic routes have managed. \"Our assumption is that we will fill every plane, and we price accordingly,\" said Mogensen.  But Wow Air's biggest advantage might be its headquarters. Iceland is ideal, because it gives airplanes a midpoint where they can stop to refuel. That allows the airline to fly passengers to and from Europe in smaller planes, which it can more consistently fill with passengers. It also helps the airline save money on fuel. \"About 40 percent of the fuel airplanes carry is used to ferry the fuel to the final destination,\" said Bob Mann, an aviation industry analyst at R.W. Mann and Co. Consulting. \"As you go shorter and shorter distances, you can ferry less fuel, and save money.\"  Convincing customers to travel with a stop over might be difficult, but if it means hundreds in savings it's hard to believe it won't be possible.  Still, the small Icelandic airline faces what some industry experts believe is a steep uphill battle. Wow Air isn't, after all, the first airline to try operating cheap transatlantic flights. Low-cost air travel pioneer Freddie Laker tried unsuccessfully to do it in the late 1970s with Laker Airways; the airline closed in the early 1980s after it couldn't stay afloat. More recently, Norwegian.com, a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, began offering affordable transatlantic flights this summer. The pitch was London-New York flights for $241. But the flights haven't been as cheap as advertised, and the routes have been stricken with delays, according to Mann. \"Norwegian has had huge difficulties,\" he said. \"All across the summer it has been running relays for its transatlantic flights to and from New York.\"  The biggest obstacle to discount long distance air travel might simply be that long trips could strip an airline like Wow Air of the efficiency on which it so heavily relies. Despite Wow Air's advantage of being able to stop in Iceland, the nearly 5.5-hour flight between Boston and Reykjavik is still long by budget airline standards.  A comparatively small fleet becomes a competitive disadvantage as soon as there's a delay. \"Once it starts to get off-schedule, they'll never get it back on schedule unless they start cancelling flights,\" said Mann. Likely for that very reason, low cost carriers have soared domestically, but shied away from routes between North America and Europe. Discount airlines currently control nearly a third of the airline market in North America, and more than third of it in Europe, but only about 1 percent of the market for transatlantic travel.  Ryanair, which operates more than 100 aircrafts in Europe has been contemplating transatlantic flights for years, but has yet to jump the gun. \"If anybody was going to do it, and anybody had the greatest potential to succeed, it would be them.\" Mann said. \"And yet they've decided it's not in the cards. That's a cautionary tale, I'd said.\"  Wow Air, for its part, is optimistic about its ability to offer the cheapest form of transatlantic travel. \"The long haul low cost model hasn't really been implemented because it's hard to achieve the utilization needed,\" said Mogensen. That is, unless you have a hub in the middle. And Iceland is perfectly suited,\" said Mogensen.  And despite the added fees from Wow, consumers may still think they're getting a bargain. \"If you think you can make it Europe with an 11 pound bag, Wow Air offers a fantastic deal,\" said Parson. \"Even with their extras, you would still end up flying for a lot cheaper than with other carriers.\"  The airline plans to expand at least four more destination in North America by 2016, and fly two extra jets next year and a total of 10 airplanes by 2016.",

        "article": "A fresh opponent to Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer’s world governing body, emerged on Tuesday as Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, a FIFA vice president from Jordan, announced his intention to run for the office in May.  The announcement makes him the third probable candidate for the election, which will be held at FIFA’s headquarters in Zurich on May 29. The others are former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, who was fired from his role at the organization in 2010, and Mr. Blatter, who is expected to seek a fifth consecutive term.  Mr. Al Hussein, 39 years old, is a member of the royal family of Jordan. He currently serves on FIFA’s executive committee, where he has often aligned himself with several of its more reform-minded members. His most high-profile project in the role was successfully leading the campaign to lift the ban on hijabs in women’s soccer.  In a statement released on Tuesday, Mr. Al Hussein said that by running for FIFA’s top post, he was hoping to restore transparency and credibility to the organization.  “I am seeking the presidency of FIFA because I believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport,” he wrote. “The world’s game deserves a world-class governing body—a service organization and a model of ethics, transparency and good governance. The headlines should be about football, the beautiful sport, not about FIFA.”  FIFA has been racked by scandal during Mr. Blatter’s current four-year term. He oversaw the December 2010 vote that awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting rights to Russia and Qatar, respectively, and the stuttering institutional reform process that followed.  FIFA’s most recent black eye came last fall with the debate over a report into allegations of corruption in the World Cup bidding process. The New York-based lawyer who produced the report, Michael Garcia, resigned from his role as FIFA’s chief prosecutor December to protest FIFA’s handling of it. The report is due to be published in some limited form this year, despite FIFA’s initial decision to keep it secret. (Mr. Al Hussein was one of the earliest FIFA executives to speak out in favor of publication.)  Mr. Blatter, FIFA’s president since 1998, hasn’t been challenged on election day since 2002. He has survived legal battles and vocal opposition inside his own organization without ever appearing in serious danger of losing. Although Mr. Blatter turns 79 in March, no one inside FIFA seriously expects age to stand in his way.  “We will see on the first of February who are the candidates for election,” Mr. Blatter said after FIFA’s executive committee meeting in Morocco last December. He was alluding to the Jan. 29 deadline for candidates to throw their hat into the ring. “Probably you will see my name there, because I have been asked by a lot of national associations to do so.”  Whether Mr. Al Hussein or Mr. Champagne can collect the votes to unseat Mr. Blatter is a tricky calculation. The vote is open to all 209 national member associations of FIFA. Mr. Blatter is believed to control large blocs of votes in Africa, South America and Asia, according to FIFA insiders.  “This wasn’t an easy decision,” Mr. Al Hussein said in his statement. “It came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected FIFA colleagues over the past few months.”  Besides repairing FIFA’s tarnished image, the biggest task for the next president will be handling the selection process for a 2026 World Cup host. The bidding kicks off some time in 2015 with a vote expected in 2017.  Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com",

        "article": "One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill struggled to explain why their party’s presidential nominee was enamored with a man they have long cast as one of America’s primary foes.  Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of distancing themselves from Trump’s comments – the latest being his praise for Putin in an NBC News national security forum held on Wednesday.  “If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters.  “I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor.”  While Graham said he found Obama to be “weak”, “indecisive” and someone Putin had “walked all over”, the visibly frustrated senator added: “But no, I’m not going to say that Putin’s a better leader than a democratically elected president of the United States even though I have differences with him.”  It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to endorse Trump and has been among the candidate’s biggest critics, spoke positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After telling reporters on Monday that Trump would give Hillary Clinton “a hell of a race”, the senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump’s overtures toward Putin.  “This whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a relationship in a person since Munich,” Graham said.  Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a central tenet of his own presidential campaign, similarly disagreed with Trump’s assertion that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama.  “Look, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,” Rubio told the Guardian.  “I don’t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he exhibits is thuggery … and we should be clear-eyed about that,” he added, noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political opponents were either imprisoned or found dead.  Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the candidate’s posture might evolve.  “My sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who Vladimir Putin truly is – that’s my hope,” responded the senator, who is backing Trump.  “At the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part of the single biggest blunder ever when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that’s the reset with Russia.”  While Trump’s habit of making pro-Russia statements is not new, his refusal to adopt the GOP’s hard line against Putin has become a source of discomfort for Republicans.  Not only has his party argued that Russian military intervention in Ukraine would not have been possible had the Obama administration sufficiently stood up to Putin, but it has also cited Clinton’s role as former secretary of state to discredit her foreign policy experience.  But Trump, since becoming the nominee, has both continued to extol Putin’s leadership and even called on the Russian government in July to hack Clinton’s emails. While drafting the GOP platform at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, the Trump campaign also fought to eliminate language around arming Ukraine in its fight with Russia – bringing further scrutiny to the ties between Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, and pro-Russian interests. (Manafort was let go from the campaign last month.)  The paradox was palpable as many Republicans approached in the hallways of the Senate declined to address Trump’s latest string of pro-Putin comments.  John McCain of Arizona and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both vulnerable Republican senators facing tough re-election battles, had nothing to say.  “You should ask Donald Trump about that,” Toomey said, while McCain simply stated his own opinion that Putin is “a murderer and a thug” but pointedly refused to discuss Trump.  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the runner-up in the Republican presidential primary who memorably declined to endorse Trump at the convention in Cleveland, referred the Guardian to his press office. And two members of Senate Republican leadership – John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas – said they had not seen Trump’s remarks.  Asked directly if it was fair to say that Obama has been a better president for America than Putin has been for Russia, Cornyn demurred: “I’m not gonna go down that path.”  Bob Corker, the senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, also initially said he was no longer responding to each one of Trump’s controversial statements. But when pressed by the Guardian about the implications of the mutual respect between Putin and Trump, if the latter was elected president, Corker acknowledged that “personal relationships end up affecting things”.  “We have national interests right now that are very different in many cases than those of Russia,” he said. “I think one has to be careful not to succumb to flattery.”  Earlier in the day, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, faced several questions pertaining to Trump’s appearance at the foreign policy town hall. The nation’s top Republican dubbed Putin as “an aggressor who does not share our interests” and suggested Russia was behind state-sponsored cyber-attacks “on what appears to be [the US] political system”.  But Ryan, too, reached his limit while fielding repeated queries about Trump.  “I’m not going to stand up here and do a tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night,” he said.",

        "article": "Todd Heisler/The New York Times  The jazz clarinetist Anat Cohen.  In search of some live Brazilian music a few months ago, I found my way to Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, in the Time Warner Center, where the Brazilian percussionist Duduka Da Fonseca was leading a quintet. I can’t say I knew much about Mr. Da Fonseca before I heard his band that night, and among the things I didn’t know was that his quintet’s regular reed player was a 38-year-old Israeli woman named Anat Cohen, who has lived in New York since 1999.  On the first few tunes of the set — mostly the kind of fast-paced, Brazilian-tinged jazz I’ve always loved — Ms. Cohen played the reed instrument most closely associated with postwar jazz: the tenor saxophone. It was immediately apparent that she was a terrific musician, fluid, full-throated, with a knack for creating beautifully crafted, even eloquent solos. Around the fifth song, however, the quintet began playing “Chorinho pra Ele,” a simple, infectious samba by Hermeto Pascoal, the great Brazilian multi-instrumentalist. And that’s when Ms. Cohen did something you rarely see a jazz reed player do these days. She took out her clarinet.  As good as her saxophone playing was, Ms. Cohen on the clarinet was a revelation. Using the clarinet’s upper register, she could evoke infectious joy. In the lower register, her playing could conjure a deep, soulful melancholy. On up-tempo numbers, her improvisations weren’t just bebop fast; they had a clarity and deep intelligence that is really quite rare. She made it look effortless, even as she was playing the most technically difficult of all the reed instruments. She only played a handful of songs on the clarinet that night, but every time she did, she took my breath away.  I suppose I could say that I’d never heard anyone play the clarinet quite like that, which would be true enough. (As I later learned, she’s been the Jazz Journalists Association’s clarinetist of the year for the last six years.) But let’s be honest here: like many jazz fans, I have rarely heard anyone play live jazz clarinet.  A dominant instrument in jazz’s early years, the clarinet faded into obscurity as the saxophone became the reed instrument of choice once Charlie Parker and his alto sax helped birth the bebop movement. When you think of jazz clarinetists, only a handful of names spring to mind, including Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, whose heyday was the 1930s, and Woody Allen, whose playing will never cause anyone to forget that he makes his living as a filmmaker.  Watching Ms. Cohen that night, I thought of another clarinet player: myself. All through grade school, I took lessons, but in high school, as I became captivated by jazz, I tossed the clarinet aside and took up the saxophone and flute. In the little high school group I played in, I don’t think I ever once trotted out my clarinet. In high school jam sessions, every reed player was a saxophonist. The clarinet was just, well, uncool. (“Highly mediocre” would be a generous way to describe my playing.)  I could imagine Ms. Cohen having those same feelings as a teenager. I could picture her abandoning her clarinet in favor of the hipper, harder-edge tenor sax. What I wound up wondering was what led Ms. Cohen back to the clarinet? And what did her re-embrace of it say not only about her, but about the clarinet’s potential to become a mainstream jazz instrument again?  “I wanted to be John Coltrane,” Ms. Cohen said with a laugh a few days later, when we met in her small East Village office. The second of three children, Ms. Cohen grew up surrounded by music; her brothers were also aspiring jazz musicians. (Indeed, all three Cohens are musicians today: older brother, Yuval, plays the soprano saxophone, while younger brother, Avishai, is a trumpeter. They often play together as the 3 Cohens.) By the time they were in their early teens, the Cohens were all enrolled in a music conservatory in Tel Aviv.  Ms. Cohen took up the clarinet because the conservatory needed clarinet players, and she was amenable. The instrument fit well with her first introduction to jazz: the conservatory’s Dixieland band, which she joined. “I discovered that I loved the music of New Orleans,” she said. The clarinet, of course, was an important instrument in early New Orleans jazz.  But as her tastes broadened, Ms. Cohen fell under the sway of Coltrane, the great 1960s tenor saxophonist. In high school, a teacher told her that her clarinet really didn’t fit with the modern jazz she liked. “I kind of put a cap on my clarinet without really thinking about it,” she recalled.  By the time she enrolled in Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1996, she was a committed tenor saxophonist, wanting nothing so much as to emulate the “sheets of sound” that Coltrane made so famous.  At Berklee, she occasionally picked up the clarinet — “whenever they needed a clarinet player, they called me” — and remembers one of her professors telling her that she “really had a sound on the clarinet.” But she let the remark pass. By 1999, she had moved to New York, and was making her way as a professional musician. She was the tenor saxophonist in an all-female jazz ensemble called the Diva Jazz Orchestra. Her friend, the Brazilian saxophonist Daniela Spielmann, recalled that when she first met Ms. Cohen, “all she ever played was the saxophone.”",

        "article": "A cherry manufacturing king committed suicide in a Brooklyn factory after his business was exposed Tuesday as a “Breaking Bad”-style drug den, sources said.  “Take care of my kids!” Arthur Mondella, 57, screamed to his sister after locking himself in a bathroom at the Dell’s Maraschino Cherries company.  The sound of a gunshot then echoed through the factory, home to the family-owned business since its 1939 opening. Joanne Capece stood outside helplessly as her brother pulled the trigger.  Investigators were searching for documents and questioning Mondella for about five hours when they came upon a flimsy-looking shelving system. Sent to the Red Hook business about 8 a.m. to uncover alleged pollution in the waters near the cherry plant, investigators were hit by a faint smell of weed.  A detective assigned to the Brooklyn district attorney’s office noticed the shelves attached to the wall by magnets. Authorities started asking Mondella about the partition and he excused himself. He walked into the bathroom attached to his office.  A source who knew Mondella told the Daily News that the cherry king had a license to carry a gun and often kept it holstered to his ankle.  After Mondella shot himself in the head, investigators were shocked to discover three bags holding about 80 pounds of pot and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash stashed in the factory, sources said.  Later, after executing a search warrant on the secret entrance, investigators uncovered “a huge marijuana-growing operation” underneath the warehouse, a source said.  In the space below the plant, they also found numerous high-end vehicles, including a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche and Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  “Underground, it was really ‘Breaking Bad,’” said the astounded law enforcement source.  Sources indicated the cherry plant was equipped with an elaborate security system.  Friends of the dead businessman were stunned by both the suicide and the discovery of the supposed drug operation.  “I talked to him yesterday,” said Ethan Casucci of Thought for Food & Son, who helped Mondella rebrand the company last year. “That doesn’t seem right. He seemed fine.”  A reeling Brian Roberts, 48, owner of the neighboring Cornell Paper and Box Co., recalled Mondella as a friendly guy. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Mondella offered to run a power line into Roberts’ business when he lost electricity.  “We were all here wondering what would lead him to take his life,” said Roberts. “This is shocking.”  The initial raid was conducted by the state Department of Environmental Conservation, the city Department of Environmental Protection and detective investigators from the Brooklyn DA’s office. The authorities who arrived at the Red Hook facility with four warrants weren’t looking for drugs, officials said.  They were instead trying to nail Mondella, a third-generation owner of the business, for dumping syrup and other cherry-related waste into the water near the warehouse, sources said.  About 25 investigators descended on the Dikeman St. facility, home to a $5 million renovation just last year. Investigators fanned out across four buildings at the plant as the probe began.  One of the detectives spotted the shelves inside a gated area of the factory, and thought the wall “appeared to hide a secret room,” a source told The News. The investigators spied a ladder leading to a basement where the bags of weed were spotted, the source said.  The cherry factory — with big-name clients like Caesars Entertainment, Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings and Chick-fil-A — was long targeted by the city Department of Environmental Protection.  There was enough sticky discharge to turn some local bees red, raising flags of the same color.  “It probably would have been a fine,” one source said of the spillage. “Nobody does 10 years in prison for dumping cherry syrup in the water.”  Mondella had a previous arrest in 2011 for assaulting his second wife in Brooklyn’s 60th Precinct. The charges were later dropped.

        "article": "“People were yelling ‘Get down! Get down!’” said Marc Engel, an accountant who was on a bus in the area when he heard the shots. “It took about 15 seconds, a lot of pop, pop, pop, pop, one shot after the other.”  Afterward, he saw the sidewalks littered with the wounded, including one person “dripping enough blood to leave a stream.”  Wearing an olive suit and tie and carrying a briefcase, Jeffrey Johnson walked up to the import company vice president, Steven Ercolino, put a gun to his head and fired without saying a word, authorities said. A witness told investigators that Johnson shot Ercolino once in the head and, after he fell to the sidewalk, stood over him and shot him four more times.  “Jeffrey just came from behind two cars, pulled out his gun, put it up to Steve’s head and shot him,” said Carol Timan, whose daughter, Irene, was walking to Hazan Imports at the time with Ercolino.  The gunman walked away and calmly turned up 5th Avenue, where he blended in with the crowd, police said.  A construction worker who saw the shooting followed Johnson and alerted two police officers, a detail regularly assigned to patrol city landmarks like the 1,454-foot skyscraper since the 9/11 terror attacks, officials said.  There were conflicting accounts about whether Johnson fired at the police officers or just pointed the gun at them.  Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly initially said the officers were fired upon, but later said police were investigating. Johnson can be seen on video reaching into a bag, pulling out a .45-caliber pistol and pointing it at officers, Kelly said.  The two officers drew their weapons and fired 16 rounds, killing Johnson, Kelly said.  “These officers ... had absolutely no choice,” Kelly said. “This individual took a gun out very close to them and perhaps fired at them.”  Kelly said investigators believe police may be responsible for some of the injuries, based on the gunman’s weapon. Johnson’s semi-automatic weapon was equipped to fire at least eight rounds; at least one round was left in the clip, police said. Another loaded magazine was in his briefcase.  Johnson legally bought the gun in Sarasota, Fla., in 1991, but he didn’t have a required permit to possess the weapon in New York City, police said.  “New York City, as you know, is the safest big city in the country, and we are on pace to have a record low number of murders this year,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. “But we are not immune to the national problem of gun violence,” he said about the shooting, which comes in the wake of mass shootings inside a Colorado movie theater and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.",

        "article": "personal physician probably gave his patient 40 times more surgical anesthetic than he admitted to police, a drug expert testified Thursday.  Anesthesiologist Steven Shafer also said Dr.  had the drug flowing into the singer's veins even as his heart stopped beating.  The testimony is the most direct refutation yet of Murray's account of what happened in the hours leading up to the pop star's death.  professor, said mathematical modeling based on levels of  found in Jackson's body debunked Murray's statement that he had given the singer a single 25-milligram dose of the drug shortly before his death.  The only plausible scenario, Shafer said, was that the physician gave Jackson an intravenous drip of an entire bottle of propofol, containing 1,000 milligrams of the drug, and left Jackson's side, never realizing that his patient had stopped breathing.  \"Is this the explanation that best fits all the data in this case?\" Deputy Dist. Atty. David Walgren asked. \"This fits all the data in this case, and I am not aware of a single piece of data that is inconsistent,\" Shafer said.  Shafer, the prosecution's final witness, said he based his testimony on reviewing Jackson's autopsy report and records covering the amount of drugs Murray ordered. He then applied the data to a mathematical model based on medical research of how propofol affects the body.  He said his calculations ruled out any possibility that Jackson injected himself with the drug. Even if he had injected himself six times over a few hours, the level of the drug in his blood would not have reached the amounts later found, Shafer said.  \"People just don't wake up from  like that,\" the anesthesiologist told jurors. \"It's a crazy scenario. I've never seen anything — it just doesn't happen.\"  Attorneys for Murray have told jurors that they would rely on science to show that Jackson injected himself with propofol and swallowed tablets of another sedative and caused his own death. Murray's attorneys will cross-examine Shafer on Friday.  Whether Jackson gave himself the drug or not, Murray was just as responsible, Shafer said.  \"Is it still your opinion that Conrad Murray was a direct cause, not just a substantial factor but a direct cause of Michael Jackson's death?\" Walgren asked.  \"Yes,\" Shafer replied. \"He is responsible for every drop of propofol in that room.\"  The anesthesiologist's testimony brought into perspective earlier witnesses, Murray's police interview and evidence found at Jackson's home and for the first time laid out for jurors a theory of what the doctor did to cause Jackson's death.  Shafer set up before the jury box a bottle of propofol in an intravenous drip that drained into an empty plastic water bottle standing in for the pop star's body. Without a mechanically controlled pump, the infusion was \"an intrinsically dangerous setup,\" the doctor said.  Without the proper monitoring equipment, Murray probably watched Jackson for a while and, believing that everything was OK, left the room, Shafer said. Had the doctor remained at Jackson's bedside, simply turning off the propofol drip and clearing his patient's airway could have saved his life, Shafer testified.  \"Michael Jackson died while the infusion was running,\" he said.  Murray appeared anxious during the testimony, his eyes growing wide and his head shaking.  Shafer said Murray also appeared to have lied about how much  , another sedative, he gave Jackson.  Shafer was critical of the defense's key medical expert, anesthesiologist Dr. Paul White, a longtime friend and colleague of his. White's previous report for the defense that Jackson could have drunk the propofol and caused his overdose was obviously wrong, based on principles taught to first-year medical students, Shafer testified.  \"I was disappointed, because it's not possible,\" he said.  An attorney for Murray said last week that after receiving Shafer's opinion and consulting experts, the defense had ruled out that possibility and would not be making that argument in trial.",

        "article": "Parents claim they were told IVF 'was their only option'  A COUPLE have claimed they splashed out £21,000 on unnecessary IVF treatment after being told it was the only way they could have a baby.  Sarah and Michael Anderson said that after four unsuccessful rounds of IVF they discovered the only thing preventing them from conceiving was a blockage in Sarah’s tubes – treated by a routine procedure.  After undergoing the procedure Sarah fell pregnant almost immediately and the couple are now proud parents to nine-month-old Alfie.  Sarah and Michael allege that private healthcare provider Spire Wellesley Hospital, Southend, Essex, failed to carry out simple checks that could have picked up on the problem.  Sarah, 42, of Southchurch, Southend, said: “We parted with £21,000 for IVF when it was never needed.  “Spires in Southend never did simple checks that would have normally been performed if I had seen the same doctor practising there under the NHS route, instead of as a private client.”  The couple have said they are now on a mission to tell others not to pay for treatment that may not be necessary.  Sarah said: “I would like to raise awareness of this simple procedure and what happened to us to stop other couples going down the same road.”  After preliminary NHS tests the couple were told that as Mr Anderson already had a child, their only way forward would be to pay for IVF privately.  Sarah said: “We were told that we would require IVF as we had been trying for quite a while.  “Nothing was happening and after blood checks and semen samples we have in writing this was the route to proceed, but not once did any professionals ever think to request a laparoscopy.”  A laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows a surgeon to look inside the abdomen and pelvis.  She continued: “When I finally sought further help from my doctors, after visiting the Canvey scan clinic where I had visited due to a miscarriage after a failed IVF, they finally did one and discovered both my tubes were blocked and I had lots of abrasions and endometriosis.  “Once I had the laparoscopy done and a small procedure, I fell pregnant straight away.  “The surgeon performing the procedure even said this is the first stage of investigations, which should have been carried out and was shocked it hadn’t before we parted with our money.”  A spokesman for Spire Wellesley Hospital, Matthew Calver, has responded to the couple’s claims.  He said: “At Spire Wellesley Hospital, excellent patient care and safety is our top priority and we set extremely high standards across every aspect of our hospital.  “I am sorry to learn that Mrs Anderson has raised a concern regarding her treatment but I am unable to discuss any aspect in detail given our strict legal duties of confidentiality.  Should she wish, I urge Mrs Anderson to contact me at the hospital so we can discuss her concerns.”  We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Wal-Mart issued a \"Request for Information\" at the end of October seeking partners to help the retailer develop a \"low-cost primary care health care platform,\" first reported by Kaiser Health News and NPR. In a statement Wednesday, Wal-Mart downplayed suggestions of a nationwide initiative, calling its own plans \"to build a national, integrated,\" system, \"overwritten and incorrect.\"  The chain already has 140 independently operated clinics in its stores across the country, catering to walk-in patients. Now it's trying to provide more comprehensive care by asking potential vendors to explain their qualifications and plans for providing continued services for chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, HIV, arthritis and high cholesterol.  \"They're trying to target the main middle class, working-class people who have more limited access to primary care,\" Hoffman says.  In the request, Wal-Mart says it's looking for partners that will \"help dramatically drive down the cost of care.\" But that has some people worried.  \"On principle, I probably wouldn't use a health clinic at Wal-Mart because I know that their goal is to provide product at the lowest cost to them, which would make me wonder if they would offer a quality service, or just the cheapest service,\" says Janine Maffett, an executive assistant in Atlanta.  Hoffman also says Wal-Mart may be acting on the incentive to increase the number of customers in its stores. \"Primary care is a low-margin business,\" he says. \"In addition to delivering primary care services very efficiently, they would also increase sales in stores by increasing foot traffic in stores.\"  Still, others say Wal-Mart faces a challenge in marketing a serious service such as health care to customers who frequent the stores for bargain shopping, but aren't necessarily willing to bargain with their health.  \"It's one thing to pick a TV or blender off the shelf, another thing to trust your medical care to someone,\" says Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"They have a challenge there. It's a brand associated with low prices but not necessarily high quality.\"  But Levitt says any effort to expand primary care accessibility is \"a good thing,\" a sentiment echoed by Kathy Lawver, an accounts receivable administrator in Beloit, Wis.  \"For those with low incomes or who don't have health insurance coverage, it may be a great idea,\" she says.",

The mid-American family at the heart of Matthew Freeman's fearless new satire, \"The Most Wonderful Love,\" is decidedly fractured when the play begins. By the time it's over, a complete dismemberment has been performed.

Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), an older couple plucked from 50's sitcomland though the story is set in the present, have decided to unmarry. Not divorce. They want a religious ceremony presided over by their minister (Brian Fuqua). \"When God tells us to sacrifice,\" explains Mother, who is reluctantly granting Father's request for disunion, \"we need to make that sacrifice at an altar.\"  But that premise doesn't begin to describe the nuttiness of this play, which also features a younger daughter (Josephine Stewart) who thinks she will die if she leaves the house, an older daughter (Sarah Ireland) whose foul mouth rips through the otherwise religious household like machine-gun fire, and an aunt (Laura Desmond) who stutters and has scoliosis. Oh, and the younger daughter's friends, whom she met on the Internet, are three conservative Christian polygamists.  There is not space here to enumerate everyone who is skewered by the versatile Mr. Freeman, whose impressive 2001 play, \"The Death of King Arthur,\" was an iambic-pentameter treatment of the Arthurian legend, staged outdoors.  Sometimes this play borders on cruel, and certainly religious people from any part of the spectrum might recoil at hearing the Lord's Prayer recited from the stage in this type of show. But the most impressive thing (in addition to the acting, which under Kyle Ancowitz's direction is uniformly fine) is that beneath all the fury is an oddly touching portrait of dashed expectations.  \"The Most Wonderful Love\" continues through July 1 at Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa; (212) 868-4444.",

        "article": "IRVING, Tex. — Todd Demsey walked onto the first tee at T.P.C. Four Seasons Resort at Las Colinas on Thursday dressed in an off-the-rack golf shirt and khaki pants held up by a white cotton belt with a nondescript buckle. His clubs sat in a vintage lightweight leather golf bag with one divider, two pockets and no logos. On the brand-conscious PGA Tour, Demsey looked out of place, like a muni golfer who had crashed the Byron Nelson Classic.  The truth is, few pros have a better pedigree than Demsey, who won an N.C.A.A. championship, a Pacific-10 Conference title and the Pacific Coast Amateur while at Arizona State, where he was a four-time All-America selection. Demsey was pegged for stardom when he turned professional in 1995. A chronic back injury and two operations for a benign brain tumor have limited him to two tours on the PGA circuit.  “He has a lot of game,” said Phil Mickelson, a recent inductee into the World Golf Hall of Fame and a former teammate of Demsey’s at Arizona State. “He is a really, really good ball striker and has always had a lot of talent, been a tough competitor, and he and I have had great matches over the years. I have always expected and still expect to see him succeed.”  On the tour, the difference between success and failure can be harder to judge than where the fairway ends and the first cut of rough begins. Demsey’s health problems clipped his practice and preparation, which pruned his confidence, which curtailed his consistency.  David Duval, who lost the 1993 N.C.A.A. individual title to Demsey by one stroke, is ranked 676th in the world, down from No. 1 in 1999. “I’ve had my share of setbacks, so I know what it’s like,” he said. “It’s tough. I do admire the work ethic, the keeping at it, the belief in himself that he’s shown.”  For more than three years, Demsey has eked out a living on the margins of the Nationwide Tour and in lesser pro events that are a day’s drive from his Arizona base. With his 40th birthday looming at the end of this month and a wife and two children under the age 6 to support back home in Scottsdale, Demsey feels a sense of urgency that his unhurried stride does not betray. Having regained his health, he has turned his attention to reclaiming his spot among golf’s elite.  “I’m never too far off,” Demsey said. “It’s just a matter of letting myself play well. You just have to go play golf and not worry about everything else, and that’s what I’m trying to do.” He added: “I feel I have a lot of years left in me. Physically, I feel the best I’ve ever felt.”  He gambled that his game was ready this past week, shelling out $100 to enter Monday qualifying and a shot at one of four spots. Demsey beat out several dozen other golfers to secure his place in the field. Playing in the last group off No. 1, in a threesome that included Steven Bowditch and Charlie Beljan, he started inauspiciously, with an errant drive that led to a bogey.  After making another bogey, on the third hole, Demsey was approached by the volunteer who was carrying the walking scoreboard for his group. Demsey listened with growing interest as the man described his receiving a diagnosis of a malignant brain tumor a few years ago, his subsequent surgery and continuing recovery.  “I probably wasn’t in the mood to start chatting, but I’m glad he came up to me like that,” Demsey said. “Listening to him tell his story, it sort of settled me down.”  Demsey reeled off four consecutive birdies on the front and three on the back nine on his way to a three-under-par 67. After he signed his scorecard, he was walking toward the clubhouse when a fan approached him and said: “It was a pleasure watching you play today. I’ve heard bits and pieces of your story. It’s very inspiring.”  He hears that a lot, Demsey said. “I’d rather be known for doing good things on the golf course,” he said.  In Arizona, Demsey’s college coach, Randy Lein, had tracked his round on the Internet. Lein is never surprised when Demsey shoots a low score, he said, because Demsey’s swing has changed little since he set a course-record 11-under 61 at Desert Mountain Renegade, then rated by Golf World as the toughest course in the United States, as a redshirt freshman in college.  “He’s one of the only guys where I can say I could watch him hit balls and feel as though I was getting better because he has such a rhythmic swing,” Lein said by telephone.  Demsey can repeat his swing, but could he duplicate his low score in the second round? That was the question gnawing at Lein, who said: “It’s difficult because you’ve got to be ready to play when you do have these opportunities. You have to be able to seize the moment.”  On Friday, Demsey made seven bogeys on his way to a 77 and missed the cut by two strokes. Instead of a potentially big payday, Demsey was staring at a shortfall because of his travel and lodging expenses for the week.  Lein said, “I’ve had a lot of people ask me, ‘How does Todd afford to keep going out there?’ ”  When the question was conveyed to him, Demsey said: “I guess people don’t pay attention. I’ve been a pro for 17 years and I’ve made enough money to keep going.  “The last two years have been really bad, but I’m proud that I’ve been able to play the game for a living and support my family. Not many people can do that.”",

        "article": "EINDHOVEN AIR BASE, the Netherlands — A week ago, they had been packing their bags, preparing for conferences, family visits and vacations. Now, they were returning to the Netherlands in coffins, victims of the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, shot out of the skies above eastern Ukraine.  At 3:48 p.m. on Wednesday, a military cargo plane belonging to the Australian Air Force touched down at the Eindhoven Air Base, home to the Royal Netherlands Air Force, in the southern Netherlands. On board were 24 coffins. Soon afterward, a second, smaller plane landed, its thundering propellers piercing the silence. It was carrying 16 coffins.  Along the tarmac, flags representing the 17 nationalities of the 298 victims of the crash stood at half-staff, their lines clinging to the flagpoles in the warm summer wind.  Relatives, friends and government representatives waited as the planes taxied to a stop. Among those gathered were King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima.  After the propeller plane switched off its engines, a heavy silence filled the air. Columns of military representatives appeared from the western side of the airfield, marching in formation toward the planes. Forty black, identical hearses followed them.  Among the 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were a renowned AIDS researcher, a Dutch senator and an Australian novelist.  There were no speeches or obvious tears, but a lone soldier played the “Last Post” on his trumpet, a tradition in the Netherlands during the annual remembrance for those who died in the Second World War.  One minute of silence followed, on the airfield and in the rest of the Netherlands. A public television station, NOS, reported that church bells had rung across the country right after the planes landed. Truckers, many of whom had tied black ribbons to their vehicles, stopped on the sides of highways. In shops and coffeehouses, music was stopped.  At the airfield, soldiers representing all of the Dutch armed forces entered the planes after the drivers of the fleet of hearses opened the back doors of their vehicles simultaneously.  After all 40 coffins had been loaded in, the cars left in a column toward Hilversum, an hour and a half north. One of the Netherlands’ main highways, the A2, was partly closed off. Along the highway and on overpasses, people, some crying, threw flowers. Cars driving in the other lane stopped as the hearses passed.  More bodies have been brought to Kharkiv, a government-controlled town in Ukraine, to await flights planned for Thursday and Friday.  Eventually all 298 victims of the attack are to be brought to the Netherlands, which is in charge of identifying and repatriating the remains.

Among the 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were a renowned AIDS researcher, a Dutch senator and an Australian novelist.

A Sunflower State lawmaker has proposed a law that would allow parents, teachers and childcare providers to spank kids hard enough to leave a mark.  RELATED: KANSAS SPERM DONOR TO APPEAL RULING THAT HE MUST PAY CHILD SUPPORT  Democratic State Rep. Gail Finney, of Wichita, proposed the bill, which would legalize up to 10 hand spankings as well as smacks that could cause redness and bruising. The law would also give parents the right to grant permission to others to spank their own children.  Current Kansas child-protection laws allow spankings that don't leave marks. At least 30 other states have banned corporal punishment altogether.  The proposed law would continue to ban hitting a child with a fist as well as striking a child in the head or body or with a belt or switch.  Finney, who has three sons and four grandchildren, has said she proposed the tougher laws to restore discipline in families, an idea she first heard from local lawyer Britt Colle.  RELATED: KANSAS MIDDLE SCHOOL SEX ACT POSTER OUTRAGES DAD  \"This bill basically defines a spanking along with necessary reasonable physical restraint that goes with discipline, all of which has always been legal,\" Colle told KCTV.com. \"This bill clarifies what parents can and cannot do.\"  Kansas Rep. John Rubin, who chairs the state committee that would debate the bill first, told KCTV he's not certain his group will even consider the proposal.

        "article": "The pop stars hit out at their over-zealous fans  ONE Direction stars Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson have been forced to change their phone numbers after being inundated with ‘disgusting’ messages.  The boys took to Twitter to complain about their invasion of privacy in a series of angry messages – before joking about challenging the perpetrators to a rap battle to ‘destroy’ them.  An exasperated Louis tweeted: “Time to change my number .. Getting some disgusting stuff on what’s app… Losers !”  His bandmate Niall quickly responded saying: “Me too mate. Horrific some of the things people are saying.”  Despite clearly being upset about the situation, dad-of-one Louis jokingly tweeted: “Maybe we should challenge them to a rap battle and destroy them in 64 bars?”  Their good mate and One Direction video director Ben Winston also got involved – promoting his new show Rap Battle by tweeting: “Good idea. Then we can put it on Drop the Mic.”  The news comes just hours after pop singer Justin Bieber deleted his Instagram account after falling out with his fans.  Yesterday he warned his fans that he would make his Instagram private if they continued to post cruel comments about his new girlfriend Sofia Richie.  He wrote: “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”  His ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez then stepped in to offer fans her support and said: “If you can’t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol -it should be special between you two only.  “Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you. They were there for you before anyone.”  The pair then became embroiled in a public row – which included Justin appearing to accuse Selena of cheating on him with Zayn Malik.  It’s also not the first time One Direction have had issues with overzealous fans – just last month Niall hit out after a fan took a picture of him while he was sleeping on a plane.  After the image appeared online, he tweeted: “I think this s**t is unreal. I mean if you can’t sleep on a plane without people taking photos of you,what can u do (sic).”  Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.",

        "article": "ATLANTA (AP)  There was no winner of the $242 million jackpot in Friday's Mega Millions multi-state lottery game. That means the jackpot has climbed to $290 million for Tuesday's drawing.  If there is a single winner in Tuesday night's drawing, it will be the largest lottery payout to one person in U.S. history. A winner choosing the cash option would take home $182 million.  Most large lottery prizes are split up among several winners. The largest jackpot ever was a $390 million prize in March 2007 that was split between two ticket holders.  The largest Powerball jackpot — $365 million — was divided among eight Nebraska meat packers in 2006. In 2008, Robert and Tonya Harris of Portal, Ga., claimed a $275 million Mega Millions jackpot and took home $167 million.  The winning numbers drawn Friday evening were:  Players have to correctly pick all five winning numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which grew from $237 million to to $242 million before Friday's drawing due to heavy ticket sales.  It's now 15 consecutive bi-weekly drawings without a top winner.  Mega Millions is played in 41 states and the District of Columbia.

The company has signed a lease for about 17,500 square feet at 239 Causeway Street, a five-story office building across from the TD Garden. That is a large step up in size from the company’s current 5,400 square foot office on South Street. Uber’s Boston presence has grown from three employees in 20011 to more than 40 today.  “North Station has long been a transportation hub, which is fitting, given Uber’s role in Boston’s transportation ecosystem,” said Meghan Joyce, Uber’s general manager in Boston. Now, she said, the area is becoming a 24/7 neighborhood, with food, housing, and amenities such as sporting events. “Plus, North Station is a hot, new destination for innovative companies,” she said, citing neighbors such as Converse and TripAdvisor.  Uber’s move “really validates North Station as one of the hot areas of the city,” said Ben Sutton of NAI Hunneman, Uber’s broker in the transaction. “It’s going to bring new retailers into the area and help make the case for more development.”  Boston Properties is planning to build three towers in front of TD Garden and another towering redevelopment is moving forward at the nearby Government Center Garage.  Uber’s growth has come despite regulatory hurdles in Boston and Cambridge, as well as legal challenges from the taxi industry and others.  Joyce said the company has room to grown into additional space at 239 Causeway Street if it chooses.  Sutton worked on the transaction with NAI Hunneman broker Jeff Becker.",

        "article": "LET us introduce you to the big bangs theory – everything you need to know about the season’s slickest, sexiest and most sought-after fashion must-have.  Yes, ladies, the fringe is making a return.  The fash pack have turned their backs on long and loose layers to embrace blunt, short and shaggy statement styles.  Model Gigi Hadid tried faux bangs at Paris Fashion Week, while actresses Lily Collins, Jessica Biel and Felicity Jones have also gone on a fringe binge.  I could not be happier, and have embraced the trend by swapping my overgrown side sweep for a heavy helmet fringe to hide my wonky brows and creased forehead.  Recently, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman praised her boxy hairdo for covering up her “weird” post-Botox face.  She told The Sun: “I’m not going to show you what’s under my fringe because you’ll be physically sick.”  I hear you, sister. If it were left to me, we would all be born with perfectly aligned bangs, just grazing the eyebrows — and they would never ever grow.  Here, award-winning hairdresser Andrew Jose takes us through the different bang styles and explains why which one is good for each face shape.  He also reveals which celebrities are working the different looks and shares some great styling tips.  Andrew says: “Fringes are the most versatile way to update your look and create an instant statement.  “Perfect for all ages and hair types, fringes can diffuse and soften the face while hiding a multitude of sins.  “But it is all about finding the right style to suit you.”  GOOD FOR: First-timers and all face shapes – especially round ones, as it will give the illusion of a longer face and add a bit of definition to cheekbones.  This fringe also works on hair with a natural kink or wave.  ASK FOR: A face-framing, side-sweeping long fringe that tapers in to the side of your hair. It will also need some weight taking out of it, so it is able to sit on the forehead.  CELEBRITY STYLE: Kirsten Dunst’s flirty side-fringe perfectly frames her round face.  GOOD FOR: Those who want to make a statement with a dramatic look. They look best on faces with softer features, such as heart or oval shapes.  ASK FOR: The fringe to be cut anywhere from an inch above the brows – and to be left slightly wider than where the eyebrows end.  CELEBRITY STYLE: Lily Collins’ dramatic fringe is perfect for her soft, oval-shaped face.  GOOD FOR: Heart-shaped faces, as it will distract from a more pronounced chin by drawing people’s attention towards the eyes.  ASK FOR: A messy fringe that skims the eyebrows. Those with heart-shaped faces should avoid any style that is slicked back or with too much weight on the crown.  CELEBRITY STYLE: Gigi Hadid’s faux fringe suits her heart-shaped face, while Daisy Lowe’s complements her oval face.  GOOD FOR: Square or oval faces. Those with round faces should avoid blunt bangs, as it might look too harsh.  Blow-dry your fringe for a shiny finish – dry one way then the other, using a medium brush with the dryer’s nozzle pointed toward your roots.  ASK FOR: A fringe that is slightly feathered centrally to soften your face shape.  CELEBRITY STYLE: Actress Felicity Jones revamps her look.",

As fibre optic cables continue to lay the foundations for a new era of African innovation, the continent is undergoing a dramatic “tech-hub boom”. There are now more than 50 tech hubs, labs, incubators and accelerators across Africa, with a new one springing up nearly every two weeks.  These hubs portray a very different Africa to the one often seen in the media and attract creative, young tech graduates who come in search of opportunity. In most cities, these spaces offer students, programmers, developers, entrepreneurs, creative, investors and techies a place to work, network and create for the first time.  As these spaces become the nerve centres for the tech community, they also become critical international touch-points for those seeking to engage in technology and business in Africa. They are the new points of exchange for long-term expatriates and short-term visitors looking to identify trends, find local talent, and catch the African wave of innovation.

        "article": "Here is an expanded version of the second item from my \"Albany Insider\" column from Monday's editions:  With two former legislative leaders set to be sentenced in coming days and ongoing probes into the Cuomo and de Blasio administrations, crusading U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara received votes of confidence from two unlikely sources.  Bharara may have been appointed by President Obama, a Democrat, but state GOP Chairman Ed Cox and Conservative Party head Michael Long say that the next president should reappoint him so he can keep going after corruption at all levels of New York government.  \"If he wants to stay in that job, absolutely he should,\" Cox said. \"If he doesn't want to stay, a prosecutor with similar intensity and professionalism should be appointed.\"  \"If he so desires, he should be kept on,\" Long said. \"He's certainly doing a good job cleaning up the mess here in New York.\"  Long says it's not just because Bharara is currently investigating the administrations of the state's two top Democrats - Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio. Bharara's office last year also won the convictions of the state Senate's two top Republicans leaders, former Majority Leader Dean Skelos and his deputy, Thomas Libous.  Skelos is set to be sentenced on federal corruption charges on May 12. Disgraced former Assembly Democratic Speaker Sheldon Silver's sentencing on separate corruption charges is scheduled for Tuesday.  \"I certainly laud him for what I consider the beginning of the cleanup, the cleansing, of New York State politics,\" Long said. \"It seems like the whole state is infested — the city of New York, Assembly members, state senators and now the executive branch.\"  Bharara, a former counsel to Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), was appointed by Obama in 2009 and has made fighting public corruption a top priority. Some critics have accused him of too much grandstanding.  The next president will decide the fates of all the Justice Department's U.S. attorneys.  Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton during a recent meeting with the Daily News editorial board refused to comment on Bharara's performance and would not commit to reappointing him.  \"These positions should not be politicized, even though they're appointed by political people,\" Cox said. \"To have someone like Preet Bharara going after it and exposing New york’s corruption at the state level and the city level…the misuse of govenrment funds, that is a worthy task that any president, Republican or Democrat would want to have continue.\"  Cox said Bharara's probe into Cuomo's signature \"Buffalo Billion\" upstate economic development project is proof the Republicans were right in criticizing the program as political.  \"There’s no doubt that this was corrupt to begin with,\" he said. \"This was a project the governor was intensely involved in during his reelection year.\"  He cited an Investigative Post report from last year that the initial request for proposal for a major Buffalo Billion project was written in a way to benefit one of Cuomo's long-time donors, developer Louis Ciminelli. The proposal was re-written but Ciminelli still won the bid.  The \"biggest scandal\", he added, was why Cuomo is allowing the state to build a $750 million plant in Buffalo for SolarCity, a company that is owned by a billionaire.  He also said he was not surprised that a top former Cuomo aide, Joseph Percoco, and others close to the governor are now being looked into by the feds.  \"When you have the amount of power Cuomo has accumulated, the people around him are going to benefit personally,\" Cox said. \"Power corrupts and Cuomo has accumulated so much power that it’s corrupting people around him.\"  He said the probes into Cuomo and de Blasio should help the Republicans in the 2017 mayoral elections and the 2018 gubernatorial contest.  \"This is what happens when you have so called progressive politics,\" he said. \"When you misuse government power for supposedly idealistic purposes. it’s just power for power’s sake. That’s what’s happening. In the end that ends up in corruption. It's just happened faster with de Blasio than became apparent with Cuomo.\"  A Democrat insider shot back, bringing up Cox's scandal-plagued late father-in-law--President Richard Nixon.  \"Ed Cox is either a hypocrite, or was tied up at the country club when the highest elected Republican in the state was convicted of corruption charges and top New York City GOP leaders were sent behind bars for selling their endorsement to the highest bidder,\" the Dem said. \"I guess honesty is is too much to expect from Dick Nixon's son-in-law. \"",

        "article": "As 2013 is winding down, a fresh season of auto shows is booting up. Three big international salons â in Los Angeles, Tokyo and Guangzhou, China â are opening this week more or less on top of one another.  The potential complications for automakers, as they struggle to allocate manpower, budgets and new models over a tripleheader of shows stretching across 17 time zones, is staggering. But at least one company, Jaguar, is trying to have some fun with it, introducing its new F-Type Coupe at a press preview on Tuesday evening in Los Angeles â at the same time it unveils the car to the press in Tokyo, where it will be lunchtime on Wednesday.  The conflicts play out this way: Press previews for both the Tokyo and Los Angeles shows are scheduled for Wednesday, but because of the time difference Tokyoâs Wednesday has a 17-hour head start. Thatâs why Jaguar scheduled its Los Angeles program for Tuesday night.  Adding to the confusion, Guangzhouâs press previews are set to start on Thursday, but with a 16-hour time change factored in, thatâs effectively when Wednesdayâs events will be unfolding in Los Angeles.  Automakers are approaching the conflicts with different solutions. Lexus, the luxury brand that Toyota first introduced in America a generation ago, is unveiling cars in Tokyo and Guangzhou, but not in Los Angeles. Infiniti, which is not sold in Japan, does have its logo on a new Skyline model being introduced by Nissan â but not wearing the Nissan name â in Tokyo. Confused? Youâre not alone.  The Los Angeles show promises world premieres of nearly two dozen new models during its two days of previews, as well as a design competition. The Tokyo show, which underwent a severe downsizing in recent years as a result of the recession, is showcasing a mixed bag of new cars, trucks, farm equipment, motorcycles and power equipment. The upstart Guangzhou show, which aspires to become a major international event like its larger counterparts in Beijing and Shanghai, has more modest ambitions.  Sorting through the hoopla being broadcast by organizers of this global three-ring circus, here is some of what the major automakers have in mind. Unless otherwise noted, the introductions will take place in Los Angeles.  AUDI Showcasing its A3 line of small cars, Audi will highlight an E-tron plug-in hybrid version.  BMW Plans include the debuts of the 4 Series Convertible and the Concept X4.  FORD What is said to be the 2015 Edge crossover will be displayed as a design study.  GENERAL MOTORS General Motors is having twins: the new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups arrive.  HONDA A fuel-cell E.V. concept will be shown in Los Angeles. In Tokyo, thereâs a cute Kei-class miniroadster that, sadly, is not headed to the United States.  JAGUAR The F-Type Coupe and a crossover concept, the C-X17, will be introduced.  KIA The luxury sedan presented earlier in Europe as the K9 and Quoris has a new name, the K900.  LEXUS Two design studies, the RC Coupe and the latest LF-NX, arrive in Tokyo. China gets a look at the next CT 200h.  MERCEDES-BENZ Among other German treats, there are two debuts from the AMG performance division: the 621-horsepower S65 and the Vision Gran Turismo.  NISSAN The Juke Nismo RS, 2015 GT-R and 2014 Rogue will be unveiled; in Tokyo, the BladeGlider mobility solution will be on view.  PORSCHE The long-anticipated Macan, a small sport utility the company expects to be its future best-seller, arrives.  RANGE ROVER The superluxury Long Wheelbase Autobiography Black should be in demand in China, but it will make its debut in Los Angeles.  SUBARU A near-production Legacy Concept will be introduced, along with the 2015 WRX and STi.  TOYOTA A Driver Attention Research Vehicle is due; Tokyo gets three major new models, including a wave-inspired fuel-cell vehicle, an FRS-based convertible concept and a taxi concept inspired by old London taxis.  VOLKSWAGEN The first electric VW for North America, the E-Golf concept, arrives.

        "article": "The Syrian air force jets swooped in low over the Iraqi border, dropping two bombs before soaring back to Damascus. The insurgents beneath, caught unawares, were obliterated, but the several thousand more nearby had already got what they wanted – an 800km stretch of border with Iraq that gave them an open passage between both countries.  The attack on Tuesday night was praised by Iraq's embattled leader, Nouri al-Maliki, even if he did dispute which side of the border the Syrians hit and claimed no prior knowledge of it.  In Syria, too, news travelled quickly. There though, and elsewhere, the strike in the desert was seen not as a random act but as a move choreographed with allies – some of whom were not long ago foes – to deter a common threat.  The stunning sweep made by the Isis insurgents through eastern Syria and northern Iraq has rattled the region over the past three weeks, shattering alliances and forging new ones as quickly as Iraq's northern cities have fallen. In its wake, the battle lines for the inevitable showdown with Isis are becoming ever clearer, rewriting the distinction between friend and foe, and even how wars in Iraq are fought.  Having taken Mosul and Tikrit and narrowly been beaten to Kirkuk by the Kurds, Isis is now near striking distance of some of Iraq's most strategic sites. It continues to menace the Baiji oil refinery and the Haditha dam and has encircled Iraq's largest airbase north of Taji. The advances have alarmed a region used to war but one where military threats have long been seen in conventional terms.  The Iraqi army has belatedly begun to fight back, boosted by new recruits from Shia militias. Helicopter gunships struck Tikrit on Saturday as part of what officials are describing as the start of a major offensive, though the extent of the fighting was unclear. What is almost certain is the difficulty the army faces in attempting to dislodge the militants from their newly acquired strongholds.  \"A non-state actor that three years ago was a terror group that could wreak havoc in a city was one thing,\" said a senior Iraqi intelligence official. \"But to have the same group now controlling an area from Raqqa in eastern Syria to Mosul in north-western Iraq, then down to Baquba just near Baghdad is a very different threat. It's something we've never dealt with before.\"  \"Old enemies are now sharing intelligence,\" said a senior Iraqi political figure. \"Even the Iranians are seeing some of the CIA work on Da'ash [a name used for Isis].\"  On Thursday, the Observer witnessed a large US military cargo plane descending over Abu Ghraib and into Baghdad airport. Also watching was a convoy from the most feared militia in the land, the Iranian-backed Asa'ib ahl al-Haq, whose members sat nonchalantly under the flight path. Earlier that day, the group's leader, Major General Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, had left Baghdad for Najaf, and then to Tehran, after overseeing plans for the defence of the capital.  Suleimani was well-known to the US officials who arrived in Baghdad's green zone earlier in the week for meetings with Maliki. For more than five years, between 2005 and 2011, he had been their chief antagonist in Iraq, with militias he directed responsible, according to Washington, for more than a quarter of all US battle casualties. This time though, the foes paid each other no heed.  The US military might that Suleimani fought so hard to counter will be needed if the battle with Isis is to be won. Iranian muscle in Baghdad will be just as important. So too will be the support of other regional states, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, who have no affection for Iran or Iraq and have been at odds with the White House for the last three years.  Syria looms as essential to Iraq from here on, even given the fraught recent history between Baghdad and Damascus. \"They are not our friends and we know it,\" said an Iraqi official linked to Maliki's office. \"We had big problems with them in 2009.\" In the summer of that year, four Iraqi government ministries were blown up with massive truck bombs and Iraq was convinced that the plots were hatched by Syrian officials.  \"I went to Turkey to meet with [Syrian General] Ali Mamlouk,\" said the former head of the intelligence division of Iraq's interior ministry, Major General Hussein Ali Kamal. \"I showed them what we had. They could not have been more guilty. Mamlouk kept repeating to me, 'I will not recognise a country that is under American occupation'.\"  Iraq's enmity was set aside by Syria's civil war, which was framed first by Iran, and then by Iraq, not as a populist revolt but as a fight against jihadists intent on eradicating Shias. Iran is a Shia Islamic regime, while Iraq is ruled by a Shia majority government.  Before Suleimani arrived in Baghdad, he had been based in Damascus, Iraqi and US officials say, shoring up the Syrian capital against attempts by insurgents to topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad. All the while, he had used Iraqi airspace to resupply the Syrian military with ammunition. The air route had been condemned by the US, which had demanded that Maliki force down several Iranian planes for inspection.  By late 2012, Isis operatives had become significant players in the war for northern and eastern Syria. Early the following year, the group felt strong enough to assert its supremacy over a rival jihadist organisation, Jabhat al-Nusra. Ever since, it has enforced a merciless interpretation of sharia law over Aleppo and Idlib and in the eastern third of the country, where it had used the city of Raqqa as a power base and a launching pad to push into Iraq.  All of this was while Assad turned his guns on other elements of the Syrian opposition. \"We control the oilfields and all the tribal land towards Anbar,\" a senior Isis operative told the Observer in Antakya earlier this month. \"We know they are not going to bomb our key sites. Their main enemy is the so-called moderates.\"  Raqqa was attacked a week after the conversation. But the main Isis base, a hospital in central Aleppo, remains unmolested by either jets or artillery. TheIsis operative said the absence of air strikes against its forces had enabled it to gather strength and numbers as it pushed towards Mosul. \"Now the border is irrelevant,\" he said. \"They are breaking down the state just as they said they would.\"  And herein lies the impetus for such a strange shift in alliances. \"It serves no one's interests,\" said the senior Iraqi political figure. \"Such a catastrophe would weigh everyone down for the next 20 years. Not even the Saudis want that.\"  The US-Iran detente has roots in attempts to solve the nuclear standoff between the Islamic republic and the west, which will reach another climax in mid-July. But Iraq's crisis is already testing the new-found connection. \"There was even talk of an ops centre staffed by US and Iranians,\" joked one western official. \"It won't go that far, but there will be an arms' length understanding.\"  How to stop Isis is also engaging Saudi Arabia which, despite its loathing of Maliki, is deeply uncomfortable with a jihadist push gaining momentum near its northern border. But Saudi help comes with a condition. \"We will do what we have to to save our flank and play a constructive role in the region,\" a diplomat said. \"But Maliki must go first.\"  Nouri al-Maliki Fighting for his political life. Difficult to see how he could become Iraqi PM for a third term with rival sects and blocs strongly against him. Allied to Iran and Syria, civil to the US, estranged from much of the Sunni Arab world.  Barack Obama His hands-off approach to the Middle East is being sorely tested by Iraq, which is a grave test to regional stability and hence to US interests. Would rather the region solves its problems on its own terms, but has little option other than to take a stake in this crisis.  Qassem Suleimani The only non-leader on the list. Very powerful head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Reports directly to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Acts as an overlord in Damascus and Baghdad.  King Abdullah (Saudi Arabia) Loathes Maliki, and feeling is mutual. Strong supporter of the mainstream Syrian opposition. Enemy of Bashar al-Assad. Sees an Iranian hand in most of the region's flashpoints, and sees Syria and Iraq as a proxy of the Persians.  King Abdullah (Jordan) Almost powerless in the face of such regional turmoil, without support from the US and Saudi Arabia. Has tried to quarantine Jordan from the Syrian war, but has allowed the Saudis to run weapons from the south and the US to use his land to train rebel leaders.  Bashar al-Assad Holding on to Syria, with robust help from Iran and Russia, and tacit help from Maliki, who has allowed Iran to resupply his forces through Iraqi airspace. Indebted to both countries, and is going after Isis in co-operation with them.",

        "article": "Another day, another royal commission.  This time the issue is juvenile detention in the Northern Territory.  Malcolm Turnbull's response to the ABC Four Corners program's Abu Ghraib-style footage of youths being tortured at the notorious Don Dale detention centre was swift.  Within minutes of it going to air on Monday night he was on the telephone to his ministers seeking their support for a royal commission.  The commission will hold directions hearings in August and start taking evidence in September, with a report expected early in the new year.  While it's a reasonable political response to shocking images, the problems and solutions have been well-canvassed in a library of reports from reviews, inquiries, coronial inquests and royal commissions dating back decades.  The key issue is political will.  Australia has a political culture in which it is okay for the now-chief minister of the Northern Territory Adam Giles to have said in parliament: \"If I was the prisons minister, I would build a big concrete hole and put all the bad criminals in there. `Right, you are in the hole, you are not coming out. Start learning about it'.\"  He described the system as \"soft, flaccid, and incapable of punishing prisoners\".  This week, as he unveiled a suite of changes to fix the system and added the prisons portfolio to his own duties, he explained the 2010 comments as venting his frustration.  \"Nobody wants to see kids in jail, but nobody wants to see their own kids get assaulted by other kids, their houses getting broken into, or their cars stolen, and I will stand up for Territorians who are becoming the victims of crime,\" the Country Liberal leader said.  However, if the attitude of leaders is to put young offenders in a hole and tell them they are not coming out, the chances of lasting reform are slim.  Northern Territory voters will have their say at the election on August 27, which could see the Giles government fall.  But the problems will continue.  The rate of indigenous youths in detention in Australia is at a crisis level.  It's been estimated an Aboriginal male child is 28 times more likely than a non-indigenous boy to be placed in juvenile detention, with the rate for girls a little lower - 24 times.  While indigenous boys make up a tiny fraction of the Australian population, almost half of all male juveniles in detention are Aboriginal.  If you are an Aboriginal child, you have a three in four chance of having been either warned or charged by police by the time you are 23.  And, what's worse for the long-term, 90 per cent of Aboriginal juvenile offenders reappear in adult court.  There are myriad causes, which cry out for solutions.  Well over half - up to 70 per cent in some states - of juveniles are in detention for breaching their bail conditions (some as basic as not meeting a curfew), not for any new offence.  Simply tackling the issue of breach of bail alone would go a very long way to cutting down on the detention rate.  Then there's health and social disadvantage - family breakdown, mental health problems, foetal alcohol syndrome, poverty, hunger, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education and the lack of stable routine.  These require a concerted, long-term effort from local, state and federal governments, the community sector and indigenous leaders to tackle if any generational change is to occur.  Previous reports have suggested a broader range of alternatives to jail.  But these have been undermined by governments bringing in mandatory sentencing, putting pressure on police to be \"tough on crime\", removing laws which make prison a last resort and abolishing schemes such as drug courts.  The royal commission will undoubtedly find the Don Dale centre has been appallingly managed and having a culture in which heavy-handedness is acceptable and necessary.  What's unknown is whether the prime minister will have the political will to take the findings a step further and deal with more fundamental issues.",

        "article": "NEW YORK — McDonald’s says it’s simplifying its grilled chicken recipe to remove ingredients people might not recognize, marking the latest sign the company is rethinking its menu to keep up with changing tastes.  The company says it expects the new ‘‘Artisan Grilled Chicken’’ to be in its more than 14,300 US stores by the end of next week, in products including a new sandwich, as well as existing sandwiches, wraps, and salads.  It says the biggest change is the removal of sodium phosphates, which it said was used to keep the chicken moist, in favor of vegetable starch. The new recipe also does not use maltodextrin, which McDonald’s said is generally used as a sugar to increase browning or as a carrier for seasoning.  Jessica Foust, director of culinary innovation at McDonald’s, said the changes were made because customers said they want ‘‘simple, clean ingredients’’ they are familiar with.  ‘‘Maltodextrin is just not something they have in their pantries,’’ Foust said.  The change comes as McDonald’s fights to hold onto customers amid the growing popularity of places like Chipotle that position themselves as more wholesome alternatives to traditional fast-food.  Already, that ‘‘clean label’’ trend has prompted numerous restaurant chains and packaged food makers to reformulate products, even while standing by the safety and quality of their previous recipes. Subway also introduced a new grilled chicken recipe earlier this year that it said had no artificial flavors or preservatives. And Panera Bread has said it plans to purge artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its food by 2016.  As ingredient quality becomes a more powerful marketing advantage, executives at McDonald’s have also been trying to freshen up the company’s image and shake perceptions that it serves junk food. TV ads and signs in stores, for instance, are playing up the fact that Egg McMuffins are made with freshly cracked eggs. And last month, McDonald’s announced it would start asking suppliers to curb the use of antibiotics in raising chickens.  As for the new grilled chicken recipe, McDonald’s said it will now be cooked with a blend of olive oil and canola oil, instead of liquid margarine. And Foust said she thinks customers will notice that it has ‘‘more of a lemon herb type flavor.’’  ‘‘It’s a very real chicken experience — something closer to what you make in your own home,’’ she said.  Roger Clemens, an adjunct professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Southern California’s School of Pharmacy and a former president of the Institute of Food Technologists, said sodium phosphates could be used to help chicken keep its moisture and texture when it’s being frozen and shipped.  ‘‘If you’re going to cook a fresh chicken, it’s not a big concern. But if you’re going to ship a chicken, there’s a change in structure,’’ he said.  Maltodextrin, meanwhile, might be used as a coating on chicken to distribute seasonings evenly, he said.  On its website, McDonald’s lists ingredients for its new ‘‘Artisan Grilled Chicken’’ including salt, vegetable starch, sugar, garlic powder, lemon juice concentrate, honey and onion powder. Terri Hickey, a McDonald’s representative, said the new chicken will have 12 ingredients, compared with 18 ingredients for the previous grilled chicken recipe.  Mike Andres, who took over as president of McDonald’s USA last year amid ongoing sales struggles, had said in December the company was looking at shrinking its ingredients lists.  Whether the new grilled chicken recipe helps change perceptions about the food at McDonald’s remains to be seen. The change comes after McDonald’s Corp. saw sales and customer visits at established US restaurants slip two years in a row. In January, the company named Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer, to take over as CEO for Don Thompson. That change took effect in March, right before a ‘‘Turnaround Summit’’ for US franchisees.",

Of course, those can be turned against anyone in either party who dares to question the direction of the war.  The most incendiary words came from the indefatigable Brad Woodhouse, the Democratic National Committee spokesman, who accused Steele of \"betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.\"  Woodhouse added: \"It's simply unconscionable that Michael Steele would undermine the morale of our troops when what they need is our support and encouragement.\"  I have some empathy for Woodhouse, who must be weary of dealing with the other side's demagoguery day after day. He probably couldn't resist giving Republicans a taste of their own medicine. But this is dangerous stuff in a democracy and particularly perilous from a party that, less than two years ago, rightly insisted it could oppose the Bush administration's foreign policy on thoroughly patriotic grounds.  And Woodhouse's statement came shortly after 60 percent of House Democrats -- 153 in all -- voted for a troop-withdrawal amendment sponsored by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and two of his colleagues. It would have required President Obama to present a plan by April for the \"safe, orderly and expeditious redeployment\" of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.  The amendment, which drew support from nine Republicans, would also have allowed for a vote in Congress to stop additional war funding if withdrawal does not start by next July, when the administration has said it will begin reducing forces in Afghanistan.  It's thus not surprising that one person who took issue with Democrats who piled on Steele was McGovern. \"The reaction to Steele from some Democrats sounded like Dick Cheney,\" he told me. \"Democrats need to understand that our base is increasingly uncomfortable with this war.\"  Now the truth is that Steele's statement on Afghanistan at a party fundraiser in Connecticut was something of a mess. Even McGovern said that \"Steele was wrong\" for asserting that \"this was a war of Obama's choosing.\" After all, the war in Afghanistan began under President George W. Bush after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with overwhelming support from both parties. And the situation deteriorated badly on Bush's watch.  Yet Steele's point -- that Obama had criticized the Iraq war \"while saying the battle really should [be] in Afghanistan\" -- was accurate enough. Obama had a choice, and he chose to escalate. And in asserting that \"the one thing you don't do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan\" and that \"everyone who has tried over a thousand years of history has failed,\" Steele was simply making arguments that other critics of the Afghanistan war had offered already.  It's fair enough to argue with Steele about all this, and it was honorable for Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, the premier Republican hawks, to take issue with their party chair, given that Obama's approach is largely to their liking.  Personally, I'm still hoping Obama's strategy in Afghanistan will work. But it is maddening that Congress can appropriate $33 billion more for Afghanistan without anyone asking where the funds will come from even as self-styled deficit hawks insist on blocking money for the unemployed unless it is offset by budget cuts.  And McGovern is right that the most disturbing line in the Rolling Stone article that got Gen. Stanley McChrystal in trouble was this observation attributed to one of his senior advisers: \"If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular.\"  But the issue here is less about Afghanistan than about dissent in time of war. Even if Steele was just popping off, he had a right to offer his opinion without being accused of undermining our troops or \"rooting for failure.\"  Some of our greatest leaders, from Abraham Lincoln to Robert F. Kennedy, courageously stood up against wars in their day. Steele is no Lincoln and he is no Kennedy, but as an American, he enjoys the same rights they had. \"It is not enough to allow dissent,\" RFK said. \"We must demand it.\" If members of Kennedy's party don't remember this, who will?",

        "article": "Despite steady gains in hiring, a falling unemployment rate and other signs of an improving economy, take-home pay for many American workers has effectively fallen since the economic recovery began in 2009, according to a new study by an advocacy group that is to be released on Thursday.  The declines were greatest for the lowest-paid workers in sectors where hiring has been strong — home health care, food preparation and retailing — even though wages were already below average to begin with in those service industries.  “Stagnant wages are a problem for everyone at this point, but the imbalance in the economy has become more pronounced since the recession,” said Irene Tung, a senior policy researcher at the National Employment Law Project and co-author of the study.  Jasmin Almodovar, a home health care aide in Cleveland, knows all about that.  She has worked for the same health care agency since 2003, and for the first four years she received an annual wage increase of 25 cents an hour. But since 2007, her hourly pay has been stuck at $9.50 an hour.  Despite an improving economy, wages adjusted for inflation have declined across the economic spectrum since the recession ended in 2009. Workers in the lowest-earning jobs have been hardest hit.  Decline in real wages 2009-14  Workers who both prepare and  serve food, including fast food  “I’ve asked for raises several times and each time I get the runaround,” said Ms. Almodovar, who is licensed by Ohio as a nurse’s assistant. Bills for natural gas, electricity, food and other necessities have gone up since her last raise, she noted, leaving little extra money for her and her 12-year-old son.  In many ways, Ms. Almodovar’s predicament encapsulates the contradictions evident each month when the government reports the latest figures on hiring and unemployment.  And the report by NELP, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, underscores why so many Americans are still angry about the state of the economy and with what they see as the inability of Democratic and Republican leaders alike in Washington to do anything to improve living standards for many ordinary workers.  One explanation may lie in the findings of another study released on Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute, also a liberal research group. Its report showed that even as labor productivity has improved steadily since 2000, the benefits from improved efficiency have nearly all gone to companies, shareholders and top executives, rather than rank-and-file employees.  Labor Department data released on Wednesday indicated that productivity in the American economy in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, the biggest quarterly gain since late 2013 and much better than first estimated.  The Labor Department’s next batch of data on hiring and unemployment, for the month of August, is due out on Friday. Economists are looking for a gain of roughly 220,000 jobs, and for the unemployment rate to dip slightly to 5.2 percent.  Friday’s jobs report is especially significant because it is the last one before Federal Reserve policy makers meet in mid-September to decide whether to go ahead with or delay their long-telegraphed move to raise short-term interest rates from near zero.  The fall in the unemployment rate from a postrecession high of 10 percent is certainly good news, Ms. Tung said, but NELP’s analysis showed that once inflation was taken into account, median wages across all occupations fell by 4 percent between 2009 and 2014.  Wage declines in the lowest-paid occupations were much worse, dropping 8.9 percent for restaurant cooks and 6.2 percent for home health aides.  Along with stagnant or falling wages, one of the most persistent complaints about the current economic expansion is that many of the jobs created so far have been low-paying ones. That has changed recently, with more hiring in better-paying fields like business and professional services.  An earlier NELP study was criticized by economists for exaggerating the extent of the so-called low-wage recovery. Ms. Tung said the analysis in the report to be released on Thursday was different from the earlier report, focusing on actual wage trends within occupations, not the proportion of jobs created in different fields.  NELP’s findings come at a time when income inequality and the failure of many workers to gain ground during the recovery are coming to the political fore. Candidates from both parties have sought to address the worries of middle-income Americans, while trying not to be too closely identified with Wall Street and other symbols of corporate America.  The past year has been the best for the job market since the end of the recession. Employers have added, on average, 243,000 people to their payrolls each month. That would normally constitute a “hot” job market, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.  “When you see all those jobs being added per month, you think, ‘Come on, how can this be bad?,’ ” Mr. Slok said. “But there has been a lot of pain and suffering, and people have been losing their skills or have not been able to re-skill.”  The roots of wage stagnation are deep, according to Mr. Slok.  Some of it is linked to what he calls the “glacial changes” wrought by macroeconomic forces like automation, demographics and globalization.  Other factors are specific to the American economy, including the real estate boom and bust, consumer debt levels and continuing slack in the labor market because of relatively low demand compared with the still-large numbers of people who are looking for work or would return to the labor force if they had a better chance of finding a worthwhile job.  For Ms. Almodovar, 36, acquiring new credentials and skills is a big obstacle.  When she talked with her employer’s human resources department about how to increase her long-frozen salary, their advice was to go back to school. Although Ms. Almodovar took the G.E.D. test and earned the equivalent of a high school diploma in her late 20s, taking classes would be a tough proposition now.  “I’m living with roommates, and if I don’t go to work, I don’t get paid,” she said. “Even one day makes a big difference.”  Many other workers in some low-paid sectors are worse off than they were a couple of decades ago.  While attending high school in the mid-1990s, Derrell Odom worked at KFC, earning $5.50 an hour. That’s the equivalent of $8.61 today.  After two years of college, two military tours in Iraq and other jobs, he is back working as a cook at an Atlanta location of the fried chicken chain. Two decades after his first stint at KFC, his hourly pay now is only $7.25 an hour.  That is barely enough to support himself, let alone his fiancée and two sons. “I have leadership skills and led missions in Iraq,” Mr. Odom said. “Right now, I’m trying to survive.”  A version of this article appears in print on September 3, 2015, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Low-Income Workers See Biggest Drop in Paychecks.

        "article": "A mass shooting takes place, followed by emotional vigils, intensive news media coverage and sorrowful statements by politicians. But what does it actually mean for laws and policies around guns?  Lots of gun laws are proposed in the aftermath of an attack, new research shows. But in terms of what actually is enacted, the results aren’t what you might expect.  In states where a mass shooting happened, 15 percent more gun-related bills were introduced in state legislatures, three Harvard Business School professors found in a working paper published last month. But in states with legislatures that were led by Democrats or divided between the parties, a mass shooting wasn’t followed by any statistically significant increase in gun laws enacted.  It was different in states with Republican-controlled legislatures. After a mass shooting, the number of laws passed to loosen gun restrictions rose by 75 percent. In other words, in places where mass shootings lead to any legislative changes at all, it tends to be in the direction of guns becoming more easily available, like lowering the minimum age to buy a handgun to 18 from 21 or eliminating a waiting period for a gun purchase.  The scholars, Michael Luca, Deepak Malhotra and Christopher Poliquin, had examined the aftermath of 167 mass shootings with 1,428 victims (including both deaths and injuries) in the United States from 1989 to 2014. They analyzed that data alongside 20,409 gun policy proposals introduced to state legislatures and 3,199 laws that were passed.  There’s no doubt that there is a surge of attention around gun policy when a major shooting takes place. Polling data from the Pew Research Center shows sharp, but temporary, swings in public opinion on gun control after particularly high-profile, emotionally resonant attacks like the ones at Columbine High School in 1999 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.  The Harvard researchers found that mass shootings had a vastly higher impact on state-level lawmaking than other gun deaths; a death from a mass shooting generated 66 times as much gun-related legislation as a more routine gun death, like in a robbery or domestic dispute.  Mr. Luca argued that high-profile shootings create a “policy window” in which an issue comes to the forefront for media and politicians alike, even if “mass shooting” doesn’t automatically translate into “more restrictive gun laws.” Mr. Poliquin notes a couple of recent high-profile counterexamples: Virginia tightened gun laws after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, and Connecticut did the same after Sandy Hook, but says they are too rare to amount to a statistically significant evidence of a bigger pattern.  The researchers’ methodology included shootings in which four or more people other than the perpetrator die in a case neither related to gangs nor other criminal activity, nor to a purely domestic matter. It is possible that most shocking attacks that cause the most deaths and receive the most news media coverage, like the recent one in Orlando, create different political dynamics from the smaller attacks that form the bulk of the researchers’ sample. But those are rare enough that they don’t lend themselves to statistical analysis.  It’s easy to see why laws in Republican-controlled statehouses enacted in the aftermath of a mass shooting tended to loosen gun restrictions. Gun advocates and many conservative politicians have argued that more widespread availability of firearms is a key to stopping mass shootings. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, embraced just that message in the aftermath of the Orlando, Fla., attack.  Pew’s research shows that the proportion of self-identified Republicans favoring more gun control has fallen from a recent high of 55 percent in March of 2000 to 26 percent in July 2015. Among Democrats, support for gun control has been relatively stable, in the 65 to 75 percent range, over that period.  The results that the Harvard researchers found could be less predictive this time. It is too early to say whether the Sunday shooting at an Orlando nightclub that left 49 dead will result in legislation, either in Florida or nationally. Republicans control Florida’s legislature. But the sheer number of deaths, the shooter’s terrorist motivations and the fact that the attack was on a gay club could make its effects different.  “Many legislatures are not even in session when shootings happen,” Mr. Poliquin said. “Florida is currently out of session and won’t reconvene until March 2017 unless there is a special session. Will the people who are angry about easy access to guns still be angry next March?”  And given that both houses of Florida’s legislature have Republican majorities, any changes could well cut toward greater access to firearms, if the lessons from this research do turn out to apply.",

Sunday night's episode left off with  on a date in an attempt to pull him away from his new interest, Samantha – who no one can stand after the nightmare that was  That plan crashed and burned pretty quickly when Chelsie decided to ask  As for Nick, he was more than excited for a chance to get out of the house – and away from  had clearly gotten on his nerves.  \"When Ashley is doing her whole weird spiel and not making any sense, everybody looks at me, like, 'Dude, your girl is out of control,' \" he said. \"I'm ready to hang out with somebody that's not weird.\"  He accepted the date and then went to call it quits with Ashley I.  \"You drank a lot last night, you kind of smell like a brewery,\" he told her. Great opener for a break-up, Nick.  But she actually seemed angrier that Nick had broken up with her before she had the chance to brush her teeth and put on makeup than the fact that he was breaking up with her in the first place. (Which is fair – if you're getting dumped twice on national television, you'd at least want to look your best while it's happening.)  Nick and Chelsie's date involved sailing around on a (huge) yacht, but it was clear the sparks weren't flying and Nick admitted in an on-camera interview that he was still \"hung up on Samantha,\" whom he had texted with casually before the show started.  While Nick was pining over Samantha during his date with Chelsie, Samantha, meanwhile, was back at the house being aggressively pursued by Dan.  On his end, Dan said he thinks he and Samantha have more in common than any other two people on the show – which sounds absolutely ridiculous considering  and Carly are basically a married couple (same with  ), and we have yet to see Dan and Samantha have any real conversation of substance that wasn't about her ex, Joe.  We still don't know what the situation surrounding Sam and her bevy of suitors is by the end of the episode, but something tells us she won't have any trouble convincing a guy to give her a rose at the next ceremony.  You may remember Mackenzie Deonigi from  as that one girl searching for love (but also aliens).  Mackenzie arrived in Paradise toward the beginning of the episode and was back with plenty more wacky behavior (and of course, more obsessing over aliens).  After getting the scoop about who was coupled up from her friend  out on her date â¦ and it got very, very weird.  The pair made their way down a rocky pathway to a fire pit on the beach, where they found themselves in the presence of a Mexican priest ready to perform a traditional ceremony.  They stripped down and were instructed to paint mud on each other, wash it off and drape themselves in robes and a thick white rope.  Watching Mackenzie try to understand the priest's Spanish was absolutely hilarious. He eventually gave up trying to explain that \"círculo\" meant circle in English and just let her smear the mud all over Justin's back instead.  The date concluded with the priest placing flower crowns on both of their heads, inviting them to kiss and joking that they were now \"married.\"  Upon returning to the house, Mackenzie  stop telling everyone about their \"marriage,\" seemingly believing the union was actually real (or maybe just keeping the joke going for way, way too long).  Poor sunburned Justin couldn't help but laugh: \"I went through the honeymoon phase with Mackenzie, and now reality has set in.\"  The next girl to arrive was Jaclyn Swartz, from  \"I'm ready to rumble,\" she said during her on-camera interview. \"I want to steal people's boyfriends, I want to disrupt the peace.\"  That being said, she wasn't particularly impressed with the line-up: \"They may as well call this Kaitlyn's Rejects,\" she said, in reference to the fact that several of the men on the show were  's castoffs. \"It's slim pickings out here.\"  So who does she go for? (It's certainly not  , who she had no trouble calling out as \"the welder who can't construct formal sentences.\")  , one of the hottest (and most non-committal) commodities on  this season. At this point, Jared is essentially linked with Ashley I. after she gave him a letter and her rose at the ceremony the night before.  \"Jared is like the nicest guy in the house,\" explained Tanner. \"And Jaclyn kind of has a black widow feel to her, like she would rip your head off after sex.\"  Petition to make Tanner the official  After seeing Jaclyn make her move on Jared, Ashley I. was thrown into a frenzied panic and immediately ran off to find host  made quite a stir on Soules' season of  , informed Harrison that she wanted an overnight \"Fantasy Suite\" date with Jared, thus insinuating she was ready to take their relationship to the next level.  The timing was almost too perfect as she came running back with the date card literally at the exact same time that Jaclyn was asking Jared out on her date. Jared accepted the overnight with Ashley I., and Jaclyn's face was priceless.  When asked by Tanner if he was going to \"get romantic\" in the Fantasy Suite, Jared said he would \"play it by ear\" – which was just a classic, non-committal, \"sidelines bro,\" keeping-the-peace Jared response.  As for Ashley I., she was much more clear: \"I may not be a virgin tomorrow,\" she squealed in her on-camera interview before leaving on the date.

        "article": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan shifted their focus to the economy Wednesday, but Akin's \"legitimate rape\" gaffe continued to dominate the conversation. NBC's Andrea Mitchell reports.  By Michael O'Brien, NBC News  There are worrying signs about the Republican brand nationally, just five days before the party gathers for its convention and 76 days before Election Day.  A majority of voters in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll called presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and GOP candidates for Congress \"out of step\" with most Americans' thinking compared to President Barack Obama and Democratic candidates.  And 29 percent of registered voters said they had \"very negative\" impressions of the Republican Party – the second-highest number of voters to give the most intensely negative assessment of the GOP in the history of the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, dating back to 1990.  The only other instance in which the “very negative” rating for the GOP surpassed that was in 2006, before Republicans received a drubbing at the polls.  The numbers underscore the headwinds facing Republicans heading into an election they're eager to win, and illustrate the stakes for the GOP next week in Tampa, where they'll have an opportunity to soften impressions of the party.  \"It’s frustrating. This president has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to tag Republicans as the party of the rich and the 1 percent,\" said Frank Donatelli, the chairman of GOPAC, a group dedicated to training Republican candidates.  The Daily Rundown's Chuck Todd breaks down the latest NBC News/ WSJ poll.  \"Republicans need to push back even harder talking about growth and jobs,\" he said. \"That is the issue of the election; we’ve gotten a little bit away from that.\"  Indeed, the campaign has been focused mostly on Medicare in the week and a half since Romney added Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan -- the author of a plan including controversial reforms to the entitlement program -- to the Republican ticket.  That focus was only eclipsed by the controversy this week involving Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, whose impolitic comments about abortion rights in the instance of rape threatened to raise a messy debate that could cost GOP candidates among women voters, with whom they already generally lag.  \"Republicans have really gotten off-message in the last week and a half,\" said a veteran GOP operative well-versed in the party's campaign efforts. \"If you’re Mitt Romney or a Republican candidate, you need to be operating within a message framework centered on economic issues, not on issues that are historically unfriendly to Republicans.\"  But the souring GOP brand likely has a longer tail than the last few weeks. A bloody presidential primary and congressional gridlock have contributed to a sense that Republicans don’t represent the mainstream.  GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn were hoping Rep. Todd Akin wouldn't be running for Senate in Missouri, NBC News' Chuck Todd suggests. Todd joins a conversation about Akin's impact on the GOP brand, why Mitt Romney needs to make the RNC count for him and a new NBC News/WSJ poll on the '12 election.  Fifty-four percent of voters said that Republican candidates for Congress were out of step with the public, versus 38 percent who called them mainstream. By contrast, voters view Democratic candidates more evenly: 45 percent said Democratic congressional candidates were mainstream, and 48 percent called them out of step.  \"The Republican brand has become the opposite of what the middle class is looking for,\" said Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  He pointed to House Republicans' votes to approve Ryan’s controversial budgets, and repeated votes to repeal health care reform -- among other instances of legislative gridlock -- as contributing to a decline in the GOP's image.  To that end, Democrats opened up an advantage over Republicans on the question of the generic ballot -- which party voters generally prefer to control Congress -- in the August NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Forty-seven percent of voters said they prefer Democratic control of Congress, and 42 percent support GOP control; a one or two-point margin had separated the parties on that question since April.  Several Republicans who spoke for this story expressed concern that Romney's selecting Ryan as a running mate had needlessly made Medicare a central issue in the campaign. While Republicans had expected to fight on that issue, and had sought to inoculate themselves from having voted for Ryan's controversial budgets, some questioned the wisdom of having spent much of the last week and a half fighting on that issue -- one usually favorable to Democrats -- rather than the economy.  But voters’ adverse impression of Republicans might not translate to losses in Congress, at least in the House. Most election prognosticators have said their models don’t predict the kind of Democratic wave in the House that would deliver the net gain of 25 seats they need to retake control.  Several Republicans expressed concern that Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as a running mate had needlessly made Medicare a central issue in the campaign.  “The popularity of Congress, top to bottom, is not extremely high,” said Brad Dayspring, a senior adviser to the Young Guns Action Fund, a super PAC founded by former aides to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. “That being said, a lot depends on what happens in the individual races. Individual members of Congress, especially a lot of our freshmen, remain popular at home. Additionally, the Republican majority becomes a lot more important to people when it serves as a check and a balance.”  The brand problem could be more serious in statewide races for Senate or governorships – or on the national, presidential level. But some conservatives are betting their enthusiasm and general disappointment in Obama’s performance after four years might be enough to deliver the election.  “The Republican brand is not fully restored to its pre-2000 level.

        "article": "By Scott Bowles, USA TODAY  If Hollywood's big-studio executives share a New Year's resolution, it may be to forget 2010. Not that the money was bad. Thanks to inflation and 3-D tickets that routinely topped $15, this year's sales kept relative pace with last year's grosses and crossed $10 billion for only the second time in history.  But 2010 was full of hopes not fully realized. High-profile sequels like ShrekForever After and Sex and the City2 all failed to do better than their predecessors. And only one movie crossed $400 million (Toy Story 3), compared with two in 2009 — including the biggest movie ever in Avatar.  Still, 2010 had some high moments. Brainy pictures made a comeback, as did some old-fashioned action heroes. And with the Oscars almost two months away, we look back at the highs and lows and dispense some unofficial awards:  Movie star of the year  It's hard to believe that a guy who called himself King of the World in 1997's Titanic could get much higher.  But he outdid himself this year with two surprise hits: Inception ($293 million) and Shutter Island ($128 million).  And he had to have been relieved when Avatar passed Titanic to become the highest-grossing film ever. Privately, DiCaprio had tired of being the poster boy for the epic romance. For now, he's just fine being the king of Hollywood.  How do you argue against those unwieldy glasses when two of the top three films in 2010, Toy Story 3 and Alice in Wonderland, were shot in the third dimension? (Iron Man 2was the exception.) Easy, if you're James Cameron. And he's not thrilled with the movement he spearheaded.  He maintains that \"3-D got a lot more credit than it deserved\" in Avatar. \"There was 3-D in maybe 10% of the movie.\"  Cameron says he's disappointed by some studios that have converted standard films into 3-D. \"I've called some of them and said, 'Don't convert a movie in six weeks. That was never the filmmaker's intent.' Audiences have gotten burned, and they're looking more critically\" at the technology.  Others are won over. Ang Lee surprised the industry when he announced he would shoot his literary adaptation The Life of Pi in 3-D. \"It's a new frontier,\" he says. \"You can look at things differently because of this technology.\"  Studio execs may not be sure how to look at it yet. Warner Bros. opted not to convert Part I of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but will convert Part 2.  Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender were shellacked by critics and lampooned by Internet denizens for hasty (and some say subpar) 3-D conversions. But each earned more than $100 million at the box office.  \"I'm not sure what to make of it all,\" says Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros. \"But I can tell you this. It keeps me up at night.\"  There was a surprising amount of competition in this category. With Helen Mirren and Jeff Bridges filling em' with lead in RED and True Grit, geriatrics and guns made a lethal combination in 2010.  But no one was a dead-eye shooter like Stallone, who led his band of aging heroes to $103 million in The Expendables. Of course, some seniors never know when to end a story; the 64-year-old will roust his senior pals for Expendables II next year.  The 'Why-didn't-more people-see this?' movie of the year  Make no mistake: This flaying of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is an unfettered success. Network has earned $92 million and is considered by some analysts to be the odds-on favorite for best-picture Oscar, which would send it well past $100 million.  But with stellar reviews and more than 116 million Facebook users in the USA, prognosticators expected this to be a runaway hit. But it played older than expected and has earned less than Robin Hood, Valentine's Day or Jackass 3-D.  Even when it comes to original stories, studios still can't crack the \"fanboy\" code.  Worst title of the year  So it's not as bad as, say, The Chumscrubber. But Bone is a punch line looking for a joke, and American moviegoers aren't known for turning out for goofy titles (see Chumscrubber, The Human Stain and Gleaming the Cube). And there's nothing wrong with tweaking a title: Michael Mann created a crime classic even after switching the title of his Thomas Harris adaptation to Manhunter instead of Red Dragon. And that was a cool name.  A close second: 127 Hours. Like Bone, it's getting great reviews. But do we need to be reminded how long a guy was stuck under a rock?  Brainy film of the year  Here's a real twist. Hollywood got brainy this year. True, there was no shortage of silly: The Other Guys and Due Date will likely crush any intellectual offering this fall.  But give audiences credit. They made Christopher Nolan's mind-bending Inception the fifth-highest-grossing movie of the year at $293 million. Shutter Island's dance with reality snagged $128 million.  And the ballet drama Black Swan, which gets downright manic in the final 20 minutes, cracked the top 10, despite being on fewer than 1,000 screens. It will likely be a heavyweight contender come Oscar time.  Now if studios can just design some comfy 3-D glasses.  You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

        "article": "“You write it and they get all the credit?” my friends gasp. Yes, if they pay me enough. In the secret language of ghostwriting, I’m called “the writer” and my partner is “the author,” and a “with” credit usually pays more than an “and” credit. But complete anonymity pays best of all. (Well, it’s not complete anonymity: ghostwriting contracts almost always stipulate a kind mention of the writer in the acknowledgments — though not necessarily for writing. At times, these may read rather cryptically, as in: “This book would never have been written without...” )  Even when I explain all of this, I detect an undercurrent of sympathy, as if people were comparing me to the Debbie Reynolds character in “Singin’ in the Rain,” warbling my heart out behind the curtain while the harpy-voiced Lina Lamont gets all the credit. This pity follows from the unspoken judgment that I really should be singing in my own voice. After all, a writer with even a little talent must have a novel on the hard drive, right?  I just don’t think this happens to audiologists.  Doing something people regard as art — writing — for cash, and in someone else’s voice, seems suspect in a world where we’re exhorted to pursue our passions and express our true selves.  Timothy Ferriss, the author of “The 4-Hour Workweek,” urges readers to eliminate tedious, time-consuming employment (or at least squish it into one busy weekday morning) and to devote the rest of their time to their true passions. In his case, that means motorcycle racing, kickboxing and tango competitions.  One of his secrets to success, he says, is outsourcing humdrum tasks (for example, writing-related research) to assistants abroad. Why compromise by doing “work for work’s sake,” he asks.  As someone whom people outsource to, I feel rather frumpy and old-fashioned reading all of this. After all, ghostwriting casts the compromises of cash versus passion in stark relief. Sure, most people suppress some aspect of themselves in the office. But the whole point of ghostwriting is to suppress my voice in order to mimic someone else’s. I defer my own passions to write about the author’s. For all my advice to my clients, in the end, it’s their book.  These lessons haven’t come easily. In one project, I wrote that the author wished that her mother, instead of a nanny, could have cared for her kids. “That’s not how I feel at all!” she fired off in an e-mail message. (Now that I’m a parent myself, I understand.) I argued strenuously to cut the final chapter of one book; ultimately, however, it won the most praise from reviewers.  SOMETIMES, suspending your own ego isn’t such a bad thing: Compromise in the work world can bring compensation, too — beyond the kind that pays the bills. Ghostwriting has let me climb inside other people’s lives and forced me to respect choices I wouldn’t have made myself.  I’ve learned to listen more carefully, and to never, ever assume that I know how people feel. These skills improve my work when I’m writing under my own byline, too. So I’m skeptical when I hear sunny exhortations urging workaday slobs like me to chase our dreams and to forgo (or condense) the evils of the office and all its compromises.  Of course, I want to pursue my passions and to write in my own voice. But I have other passions, too: Two of them (my children) go to day care and one (my husband) loves adventure travel. If I refused to make compromises among them, we’d all be shortchanged.  For me, writing in another voice, about other people’s passions, has helped me to understand a lot about my own and how to create balance among them. So I’ll continue my scandalous sideline. In the end, maybe it really is a best career. At least until my clients start outsourcing their memoirs overseas.

Determined to be free of the bright yellow car, the man posted pictures of his car on eBay as a last-ditch attempt to persuade someone to take it off his hands.  During his hilariously sarcastic 1,000-word rant, he said: “I could tell you that this car is absolutely fantastic, a pleasure to drive, has all mod cons…..But I’d be lying my little head off!!!  “To my surprise, and amazement if I’m honest, the little bag of death has got me to work and back every morning with no problems whatsoever.”  He added: “What I can tell you, is its one of the yellowest cars in existence, and its slow, but it is good on fuel. it doesn’t have central locking, but the car is that small its not far to reach across and unlock the passenger door from the drivers seat, so that’s a bonus.  “There is also this weird slot in the middle of the radio. I originally thought it was to slide your phone into but it turns out its for something called a tape?  “From what I can work out these were around in the early 1700s so if you buy this car, you’re actually buying a piece of history.”  The seller describes the car’s qualities as having a sunroof and no electric windows which will help people stay fit when they have to open them manually.  He asks would-be buyers not to expect 24 years’ warranty or enough fuel in it to get to the nearest petrol station.  Car is sold as seen so make sure you bring your glasses.  He adds: “The car is yellow, its basic, its quite nasty to be fair, there is rust on the drivers wing, lacquer peel on the spoiler, but its only done a genuine 67,000 miles and seems to be reliable and drives really well.  “If you want a little run around, buy this car, if you want something flash, then don’t, if you have any shame at all, then don’t.  “The car is not available on finance, its 300 pounds sterling for gods sake, just turn up, look impressed, pay me the money in cash and drive away into an unknown certainty of driving pleasure before telling your friends about the amazing bargain you got on eBay and how good it is on fuel.  “If you’re too embarrassed to drive this car through fear of losing your street cred, don’t let that little problem enter your head.  “You’re reading this advert for a Micra, which means you were looking for a Micra, which means you have no street cred to lose.  “Car is sold as seen so make sure you bring your glasses.”  We pay for your stories!

The summit of China's leaders is expected to deliver some of the biggest reforms for the country in 35 years.  China is the one of the world's biggest producers and consumers for a range of commodities. In ranks number one in the steel and coal industry, according to the World Coal Association, as well as in iron ore, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Copper Development Association state it's the world's second biggest producer of copper, behind Chile. Commodities are a big deal for the biggest population on the planet, and prices have risen in the last 10 years with China the underlying driver of this \"super-cycle\".  (Read More: Will China's Plenumbe a watershed event for stocks?)  The Communist Party get-together could radically alter this picture, however. Beijing is trying to shift the economy towards consumption to put growth on a more stable long-term footing.  China's president, Xi Jinping, has promised comprehensive reforms. Urbanization and financial liberalization will likely be key focuses. A national social security system has been touted as well as more free-trade zones, land ownership reforms, changes to state-owned enterprises and property tax legislation. There is also speculation there will be discussions on tackling overcapacity and environmental pollution.  \"If China does embrace meaningful reform, it will mean a real economic adjustment,\" Patrick Chovanec, the managing director and chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management told CNBC.  \"The commodity boom we've seen in recent years was due partly to real growth, but in large part to grossly inflated demand from runaway credit creation in China. Whether China has a hard landing or a soft landing, the current investment boom will slow significantly.\"  (Read more: China faces tough balancing act as plenum looms)  Over the medium term, increased demand for urban properties and social housing should unleash fresh demand for construction materials, predict strategists Grant Sporre and Xiao Fu from Deutsche Bank. But pollution-cutting measures, limits on overcapacity, use of steel scrap and a property tax could result in a peak in steel consumption intensity and lower demand growth for iron ore over the coming decade, they said.",

        "article": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 28, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  MONICA CROWLEY, GUEST HOST: It's been a week to remember for the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. As for latest Fox News poll shows Cain with a four-point lead over his closest rival, Mitt Romney. Newt Gingrich is still in the fight with 12 percent of the vote. Rick Perry has dropped to fourth with 10 percent and Ron Paul received nine percent. Despite the surge to the top of the Republican field, Herman Cain is still reluctant to call himself the front-runner. Take a look.  HERMAN CAIN, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would say that I am one of front runners because as you know, if you were then, you know, three, four, even five points that can change next week from one polls to another. So, I don't see myself as a clear front runner because I don't have a double digit lead. But I would say that I'm right up there in the pack.  CROWLEY: Well, if a double digital lead is required to achieve front-runner status, then former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is a mega frontrunner in the key primary state of New Hampshire. The latest Rasmussen poll shows Romney with 41 percent of the vote to Cain's 17 percent. And Ron Paul in third with 11. Newt Gingrich and Jon Huntsman round out the top five. So, with Romney boasting a clear lead in New Hampshire, just how much important are the Iowa caucuses for the other candidates?  Here with an analysis are the author of \"Muzzled: The Assault on Honest Debate,\" Fox News analyst, Juan Williams is here, along with the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Ralph Reed.  Gentlemen, great to see you.  RALPH REED, FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION: Good to be with you, Monica.  JUAN WILLIAMS, AUTHOR, \"MUZZLED\": Good to see you, Monica.  CROWLEY: OK, Ralph. I want to begin with you, because something really struck me over the last week or so and that is that Herman Cain, now that he is the front-runner in a lot of these polls is getting roundly mocked. The left is trying to diminish him. Delegitimize him, marginalize him. And it occurred to me that this is the same thing that happened to Sarah Palin. This week we saw the Washington Post begin this routine with Senator Marco Rubio. And the thing that all three of them have in common is that they represent existential threats to liberalism. You've got a black man, you've got a conservative woman, you've got a conservative Latino. And that if any of those three were to gain real traction with the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party would in essence be over.  So, the left is really on this mission to destroy them and now it's Herman Cain's turn. How do you think he is handling his turn in the spotlight being right there in the crosshairs of the left?  REED: Well, first of all, Monica. I think you really nailed it. I think if you go back and you look at the 2008 election results, Barack Obama got about the same percentage of the white vote that Al Gore did in his losing effort against George W. Bush in 2000 about 42 percent. The thing that really drove that Obama landslide was he was able to win 98 percent of the African-American vote and he was able to win 70 percent of the Hispanic vote. If you had a Cain-Rubio ticket, and I know I'm getting ahead of myself because we haven't had any votes yet. But if you had an African-American or a Latino of a Cain or a Rubio type credentials on the ticket, it is without question a dagger aimed at the heart of the electoral strategy of the Democrats.  And I think, they've even got a bigger problem, Monica in this respect. Herman Cain is the personification of the American dream. This is a man who grew up in the city of Atlanta in the shadow of segregation. He was the first member of his family to go to college. He rose through the ranks of American business in the corporate world to great success. He has lived the American dream and Obama argues that it is America's sins and shortcomings that we need to focus on, and he goes around the world and apologizes for America, Cain embraces everything that America stands for.  CROWLEY: And that is what makes him incredibly powerful, Juan. You know, this week, the Cain campaign said that they were going to try to slow the campaign down a little bit. That they wanted him to see more on message, they wanted the campaign to grow more disciplined. And it calls to mind the last scene in the movie of \"The Candidate\" with Robert Redford who sort of runs this quixotic campaign and he wins. And at the end of the movie, sort of looks at the stop strategist and he says, now what do I do?  And I think that Cain campaign now is, yes, they are looking at these numbers state by state. He is either tied with Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney may be slightly ahead. In New Hampshire, Romney does have a commanding lead. But Cain is right there. And I'm wondering if the campaign now, the Cain campaign is pulling back a little bit to try to make sure that Cain is focused, that there are no more gaffes. Does that work for him or does that work against him because he is non-traditional candidate, so if he starts playing it safe, does that hurt him?  WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, look, Herman Cain is the biggest, he may be the only, but he is certainly the biggest asset of the Cain campaign. So, pulling him back is not going to make sense. I mean, he has got to be out there. He has got to be the charmer, the person that Ralph was just talking about who is just, you know, if you meet Herman Cain, you will like Herman Cain. There is just no getting away from it. And so, if you have this guy who presents himself as an authentic conservative, you want to make sure that conservative audiences are hearing from Herman Cain and do not view him as someone who is just a blip on the screen or the temporary alternative to Mitt Romney that they really come to know him.  Now, the problem has been one, money. He doesn't have the money. Certainly -- we talked about the big poll number difference in a state like New Hampshire. But you go anywhere, there is no comparing, Mitt Romney's money to Herman Cain's money. Mitt Romney is a superpower when it comes to money. And he has money, 30 plus million on him. So that he is going to be able to bombard and shape Herman Cain's image of Herman Cain if not out there introducing himself and presenting himself as a different kind of conservative than Mitt Romney.  And, you know, I would just add to what you and Ralph have been saying, Monica, that what strikes me is that the Republican establishment for the last ten days has been pointing out their problems with Herman Cain, saying the 9-9-9 plan is going to raise your taxes, he's not thought through his position on abortion, he's not thought through his position with regard to foreign policy. But it doesn't seem to matter because Herman Cain comes back and says, you know, I'm me, I'm going to learn. I'm different than the rest of these guys. And the American people, but specifically the Republican primary audience, a conservative audience says we like him and we trust him. And we don't think he's a flip-flopper, he's an authentic conservative, that is the message.  CROWLEY: And not Washington, and not a professional politician which is his big strength.  Ralph, when you look at the field as its currently made up, do you see any real opportunity for anybody else to emerge as the conservative alternative to Romney or to Cain if there are some misgivings about Cain when they finally go into the ballot box, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, any of those folks have a real shot of getting up here?  REED: Yes. I think so, Monica. This is still very fluid. It's a highly volatile race. Unlike any I've seen in my career, frankly. If you look at some of this polling. Even the polls you cited at the top of the show, if you dig a little deeper in the cross tabs, up to half of these voters say they haven't fully made up their minds, 80 percent in some of these polls say they could change their mind. We had an event Saturday night in Des Moines, Iowa, with the Faith and Freedom Coalition and we had all the candidates there. Save Romney and Huntsman. And I'll tell you, I thought Rick Perry did a very good job. I thought Newt Gingrich did a very good job. Perry is going to have money, I think he keep an eye on him. I think he keep an eye on Newt, I think in Iowa, you keep an eye on Santorum and Michele Bachmann.  But look, if you look at this electorate, those of us who know Herman are not surprised that he is where he is. This electorate, meaning the Republican presidential primary electorate, is 66 to 70 percent self identified conservative. It's about 45 percent self-identified evangelical and about half of them are Tea Party members.  So, what Herman is doing is he is over performing among conservatives, self-identified evangelicals. That is 60 percent of the vote in Iowa, about half the vote in South Carolina and of course among Tea Party members where he leads Romney by about 32 to 18.  The danger for Romney is when this field begins to winnow after the first couple of primaries, Iowa and New Hampshire, he may end up mono to mono with somebody and he's got to do better than he's doing right now among evangelicals and conservatives.  CROWLEY: Very fluid situation. And we talk about these polls but not a single Republican has voted yet. So, anything could happen.  Ralph, Juan, great to see you guys. Thank you.

        "article": "Updated APR 01, 2014 12:38p ET  LAWRENCE, Kan. -- Kansas freshman Andrew Wiggins made official Monday what he's been telling folks all along: He's headed to the NBA after his only season with the Jayhawks.  The 6-foot-8 forward, who was voted second-team All-America earlier in the day, is expected to go in the top three picks in the June draft. Many believe he could go first overall.  \"It wasn't an easy decision because the fans showed me so much love here,\" said Wiggins, choking up briefly during a news conference at Allen Fieldhouse. \"I just wish I had more time. College goes by so fast. I can see why people stay all four years.\"  Wiggins was the top-rated recruit when he arrived at Kansas, and his brief career was a bit of a roller coaster. He struggled early in the season, caught fire midway through, and then flamed out when it mattered most in an NCAA tournament loss to Stanford.  Wiggins only scored four points on 1-for-6 shooting in the third-round defeat. Afterward, he said despondently that he let his team down with his poor performance.  That ultimately didn't have any bearing on his decision, though. He announced he was going pro while joined by Kansas coach Bill Self, his parents -- former NBA player Mitchell Wiggins and Olympic silver medalist Marita Payne Wiggins -- his older brother Mitchell Jr., and several of his teammates, including fellow freshmen Wayne Selden and Joel Embiid.  Selden has already announced he's returning for his sophomore season. Embiid has not made a decision, even though he's also expected to be a top-five pick in the draft.  Wiggins certainly had a historic season at Kansas. The Canadian averaged a freshman-record 17.1 points and nearly six rebounds per game, and was voted the AP's Big 12 freshman of the year and first-team all-conference.  \"Obviously this announcement needed to happen,\" said Self, who believes one of the biggest challenges Wiggins will face is realizing that basketball will suddenly become his job.  \"It's not like this year. He came in with so much hype, and whether he knew it or not, everybody was salivating for a chance to go against a guy with that much hype,\" Self said. \"And he's going to the next level with a lot of hype, but men are going to be saying, `Whoa, whoa, whoa, rook. I've been doing this a long time and you're going to have to earn your way.'\"  Wiggins simply flashed a smile when asked if he was ready for it.  \"Just listening to him now,\" his father said, \"I'm thinking about when he was that little bitty kid that was dirty, and not listening, and now? He's a young man that I think gets it. I think he's going to do very well.\"  He's also made it through his freshman season healthy. Unlike Embiid, Wiggins never had to deal with any nagging injuries, and his mother said that factored into his decision.  \"The best thing is he's not injured. He's able to go ahead and complete part of his goals,\" she said. \"Every day is a new day. He has no injuries and he's ready to go.\"  Self said Embiid is still wrestling with his stay-or-go decision.  The 7-footer from Cameroon was waylaid late in the season by a stress fracture in his back, and that could factor into Embiid's draft status, along with the fact that he's only been playing basketball for a few years.  Embiid slipped out of the room immediately after Wiggins had finished speaking Monday, but Self told a few reporters that he had not made his decision, despite a report last week that said Embiid would enter the draft.  \"That doesn't mean he couldn't still do that, but that was gun-jumping,\" Self said. \"It certainly upset him, because somebody that was a source obviously didn't have good information.\"  Self doesn't expect Embiid to make his intentions known anytime soon.  \"The decision he needs to make is what's best for him,\" Self said, \"whether to stay another year or to go, and I could see him do either one of them. And I think you could make a case that either one would be a good decision. He's not quite like Andrew who's been playing the game his whole life. He's only been playing three years. He's still trying to figure it out.\"",

        "article": "Re “Obama’s Credibility Gap” (column, Jan. 26):  Bob Herbert’s column is very much on target. As each day passes, there are more questions and concerns about what our president really stands for and whether Barack Obama can truly lead this country toward a better future.  For many of us, there is a growing fear that we will look back on this period and conclude that President Obama was our greatest hope  and our biggest disappointment.  Shawn Ettingoff Superior, Colo., Jan. 26, 2010  Re Bob Herbert’s Jan. 26 column:  Yes, Virginia, Barack Obama may not be who we thought he was!  In 2008 it appeared to many of us that a knight in shining armor had come out of nowhere to give us hope again. He spoke eloquently and seemed to indicate that if elected his presidency would be different.  While we were disappointed in his early appointments and doubted that Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers were in tune with a new vision, we gave our new president the benefit of the doubt.  When he increased the number of troops in Afghanistan, we said we did not have all the facts and perhaps he knew something that demanded an escalation.  Now we look to his State of the Union address on Wednesday night. We are hopeful and optimistic. We want President Obama to succeed, and yes, we believe that he will, though it takes time; and we will go down a better road for the country, and all of us who come out of the 1960s will once again feel that anything is possible.  Jennifer Dorn New York, Jan. 26, 2010  In “Don’t Give Up Now” (editorial, Jan. 26), you write, in connection with health care reform, that President Obama and Congressional Democrats have “clearly failed to explain why reform will make Americans’ lives more secure  not less.”  Yes, a mighty big failure. And a perplexing one, too, in the case of the president. I wish you’d gone on to wonder why oh why he hasn’t even once emulated President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “fireside chats.” Roosevelt spoke directly to the American people, from the White House, explaining complicated issues in simple language. Thus he gained vast public support.  President Obama would be at his best in such direct, person-to-person, demystifying talks. Instead, he stands on a podium in front of large audiences in formal settings (like the coming State of the Union address) and sounds sincere and earnest, heart in the right place, but somewhat remote and not the least bit enlightening.  Joel Raphaelson Chicago, Jan. 26, 2010  Those of us who supported President Obama will not forgive him for failure to deliver on his promise of health care reform. He needs to demonstrate the fortitude and leadership that are required in this highly partisan era of politics.  He should realize that the Republicans are going to try to block everything he does. To avoid his Waterloo, he should urge Congress to pass the Senate health reform bill in its present form and address any misgivings by House members with separate legislation.  Show some guts, twist arms and explain the benefits of reform on TV to the public.  President Bush didn’t hesitate to pass tax cuts for the wealthy using reconciliation. So why has this president allowed Congress to deter him from honoring his campaign pledge to reform health care? No guts, no glory and no health care reform.  Tom Minnerick Elgin, Ill., Jan. 26, 2010  Re “Obama Summons Team From 2008 for Races in Fall” (front page, Jan. 24):  Some recommendations to President Obama about the midterms:  Read less about “Team of Rivals” and Abraham Lincoln, and more about Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, whose common touches with “forgotten Americans” gave both of them the popularity and ability to act decisively.  Look straight at the television cameras  that is, at the American people.  Unite the country, as both Roosevelt and Reagan did, on the issue all of us Americans agree on: economic growth and jobs. Reagan didn’t try to advance the divisive social agenda of his “base,” but instead common national goals.  Cultivate a common touch. It is not the more remote Democrats (like Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis, John Kerry and Al Gore) who win, but populists like Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.  And it is leaders with the common touch, who celebrate America’s common civic and religious heritage, and focus like Roosevelt and Reagan on economic growth and jobs, who will win elections and successfully establish the agenda for the nation.  President Obama was elected to focus on jobs and the economy, and it is still early enough before the midterm elections  if they can get all this right, the common touch, above all  for the president and the Democrats to re-establish their initiative and momentum.

        "article": "OMAHA — New Mexico State’s tall front line and extended zone defense were supposed to pose matchup problems for Kansas, the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. Instead, the Jayhawks found open shots everywhere, especially behind the arc, and repeatedly beat the slow-to-react Aggies down the floor to win easily, 75-56.  The day after Big 12 teams dropped all three of their first-round games in the tournament, the Jayhawks restored some respect to the conference that sent seven teams to the tournament, tying the Big Ten for the most, and topped Division I in Rating Percentage Index, a metric used to rank college basketball teams.  Kansas, which struggled from beyond the arc in recent weeks, broke out by hitting nine 3-pointers in 13 attempts while shooting 54 percent from the field. The Jayhawks led by 13 points at halftime and never let the No. 15-seeded Aggies, who came in with a 13-game winning streak, closer than 11 the rest of the way.  Guard Frank Mason III led Kansas with 17 points, shot 6 of 7 and grabbed 9 rebounds, one more than Tshilidzi Nephawe, New Mexico State’s 6-foot-10 center. Even with New Mexico State starting three players 6-foot-8 or taller and bringing the 7-foot-3, 335-pounder Tanveer Bhullar off the bench, Kansas held a 36-29 edge on the boards.  “I thought we defended and rebounded pretty well in the first half,” said Kansas Coach Bill Self. “I think that’s what got us the lead.”  A ragged start saw Perry Ellis of Kansas and Nephawe each miss dunks in the first two minutes before Kansas surged ahead, 11-4. The Aggies were scoreless for more than six minutes while Kansas scored 10 consecutive points to go up 34-16.  Kansas shot 54 percent in the first half with five 3-pointers, its largest total in a half in more than a month.  “We’re used to starting a little slow,” New Mexico State forward Remi Barry said. “We just couldn’t catch up. That’s what it is. They were making some tough shots.”  Ellis, moving carefully with a brace on his troublesome right knee, had 9 points and 2 rebounds.  Kansas (27-8) faces the winner of Wichita State and Indiana on Sunday. New Mexico State, with nine international players on its 13-man roster, finished 23-11.  “I told our guys as soon as the game was over that we were O.K. today, we were pretty good today, but we have got to be better on Sunday, whoever we play, and I think they all agree,” Self said.  For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.",

        "article": "China and the United States remain starkly different on military issues and have a long way to go toward building a trusting relationship, the top U.S. military officer said Friday after a bumpy visit to Beijing.  Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed his talks with Chinese military leaders were \"productive and generally positive.\" But he added that efforts to create a working military-to-military relationship are still young and so far fraught with difficulties.  \"There is a long way to go,\" he said in a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, where he is wrapping up his Asian tour. \"Differences between us are still stark.\"  Mullen's visit to China was the first of its kind in four years. It was intended to build on efforts to increase communications and exchanges between the two in hopes of easing growing tensions over China's growing military might and economic clout in the region.  Mullen said he was pleased he was afforded access to his counterpart, Chen Bingde, chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, and given a look at some of China's technology and bases.  But he said the visit also underscored the wide rift between the two nations.  In a joint news conference during Mullen's stay in China, Chen chided the United States for pouring too much money into its military in a time of economic recession. He suggested that fears of a Chinese threat are overstated.  Chen, who made a similar trip to the U.S. in May, stressed that China remains well behind the United States in military capability and said its military growth is purely for defense.  Mullen on Friday said he was not convinced.  \"It's too early to say where China is going with all of this,\" he said. \"They say it's defensive. We'll see.\"  Mullen also said that the activities of the Chinese, particularly regarding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, have served to fuel concerns over its ultimate intentions, which he said remain opaque.  Over the past year, China has seen a flare-up in territorial spats with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam and seen its relations strained with South Korea -- all of which have turned to Washington for support.  Mullen said Washington is also concerned about developments in Chinese missile technology, its activities in the cyber world, and its military satellite capabilities.  He stressed, however, that the United States is not going to withdraw from the region.  \"As I told the Chinese, the United States isn't going away,\" he said. \"We've operated in the South China Sea for many decades, and we will continue to do that.\"",

        "article": "From the start, this fourth trial — preceded by three prior mistrials, each one on similar charges — was burdened by the dead weight of its history. The key to the defense was Mr. Gotti’s argument that he had once been a gangster — indeed, had been the boss of the Gambinos — but eventually had broken with the mob.  His quasi confession apparently resonated with the jurors, four of whom told reporters afterward that his strategy of arguing “withdrawal,” as it is known, was crucial to their decision. The jurors said that of the 12 people on the panel, 6 did not believe that Mr. Gotti quit the mob, 5 did believe him and one remained undecided.  “The evidence was just not there to prosecute the guy,” said one of the jurors, all of whom remained anonymous. Others said they did not believe the government’s chief witness, John Alite, a confessed hit man and a former member of Mr. Gotti’s crew.  The jurors’ sharpest words came when they were asked if the government should retry Mr. Gotti. No, they said resoundingly— the only unanimous verdict they had reached.  “They should stop this now — it’s ridiculous,” said one of the jurors, a middle-aged man. Another juror, a woman, said of the prosecution: “It’s abusive. It’s almost become a mockery.”  Steeped in Oedipal drama and hinging on an emotional — if partial — admission of guilt, Mr. Gotti’s trial sometimes seemed like a proceeding for the Oprah Winfrey era. With its easy emotionalism and narratives of painful personal growth, it was not unlike the now-familiar spectacle of a disgraced politician confessing his sins — and then announcing his campaign for re-election.  At the news conference afterward, Mr. Gotti delved deeply into his feelings. He said, for instance, that just that morning at the federal jail where he had been held, other inmates wished him well, and that his family kept him strong throughout the trial.  He said that his father, who was finally convicted of murder and other charges in 1992 and spent the remainder of his life in prison, was foremost on his mind. For the last five days, he said, at precisely 10:27 p.m., two songs — “Field of Gold” by Sting and the campy classic “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree” — happened to be playing on the radio. Not only did these songs remind him of his father; remarkably, he said, his father’s birthday is Oct. 27 — or 10/27.  Did the son feel that the father was watching over him?  “How else do you explain it?” he said.

        "article": "If signed into law, the measure would take effect Jan. 1, 2016, and make Texas the 45th state to allow open carrying of handguns. (AP)  The near-certain signing into law of an open-carry gun measure will send Texas back to the days of the Wild West – at least legislatively.  The bill, passed by the state Legislature and expected to earn Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature within the next week, would reverse a 140-year-old ban on carrying handguns in plain sight. Despite its reputation as a pro-gun state, Texas is one of just five with an outright ban on open carry.  “It’s a thumbs up for law-abiding citizens,” said Rep. Debbie Riddle. Riddle, a Republican who represents part of Houston and co-sponsored the bill. “Everywhere there is a denial of Second Amendment rights, crime is through the roof. It’s a deterrent. If someone is going to rob a convenience store and there are other people inside with guns on their hips, they might think twice.”  “Criminals aren’t afraid of prison, they’re afraid of getting shot.\"  - C.J. Grisham, Open Carry Texas  After a contentious debate, in which state Second Amendment advocates even clashed with National Rifle Association officials over their tactics, the bill cleared both Republican-majority chambers along party lines. A related bill also awaiting Abbott’s likely signature would allow students and faculty members at public and private universities in Texas to carry concealed handguns into classrooms, dormitories and other buildings.  Texas is currently one of five states that does not allow licensed handgun owners to carry their weapons openly. The others are Florida, New York, Illinois and South Carolina, as well as Washington, DC. Several other states have such strict gun ownership laws that gun rights advocates consider them to have de facto bans on concealed or open carrying of weapons.  Critics say the relaxed gun regulations could spur an increase in crime, or at the least, accidental shootings.  \"As a gun-owning Texas mom, this is not the Texas I want for my family or community,\" said Sandy Chasse with the Texas Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.  But supporters counter that guns in plain sight will deter crime.  “Criminals aren’t afraid of prison, they’re afraid of getting shot,” said C.J. Grisham, president and CEO of Open Carry Texas.  Grisham’s group held rallies across the state prior to the vote, including events at which members openly carried long guns, which was already legal in Texas. That tactic brought a rebuke from the NRA and cleaved a rift between the two Second Amendment advocacy groups.  \"To those who are not acquainted with the dubious practice of using public displays of firearms as a means to draw attention to oneself or one's cause, it can be downright scary,\" the NRA said in an unusual statement. \"It makes folks who might normally be perfectly open-minded about firearms feel uncomfortable and question the motives of pro-gun advocates.\"  The fact that the debate prompted the NRA and some Republicans to distance themselves from more hard-core gun-rights advocates in Texas was a victory for gun control, said Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,  “We saw the open carry debate in Texas this session as a win for gun violence prevention advocates,” said Everitt, who alleged that open-carry activists threatened to shoot legislators. “The goal all along here for Open Carry advocates was permitless open carry of handguns. They have failed at that, and the question now becomes what types of threats and violence are we likely to see before Texas legislators take up business again in 2017?”  Like the current concealed handgun law, the bill awaiting Abbott’s signature requires anyone wishing to openly carry a handgun to get a license. Applicants must be 21, pass a background check and get firearms training.  There are 44 other states in the Union with open carry laws already on the books.  Some 850,000 Texans already have permits to carry cooncealed weapons, according to said John Lott, president of the pro-Second Amerndment Crime Prevention Research Center, and a Fox News contributor. Since licensed gun owners commit firearms violations at a very low rate, Lott said, simply allowing them to carry guns openly will not create any new dangers for law-abiding citizens.  The notion that Texans who open carry their guns will start shooting each other is absurd,” Lott said. “Just because those people can now carry openly won’t change that, any more than the 44 other states that already allow open carry.”  A 2013 Texas Department of Public Safety study found only .3 percent of convicted crimes were committed by those holding a Concealed Handgun License.  Abbott, who has 10 days to sign the bill into law, has been a vocal proponent of “expanding the Second Amendment,” even tweeting after the measure passed: “Next destination: My Pen.”  If signed, the law would go into effect Jan. 1, 2016.",

Phelps, 28, has entered the Arena Grand Prix in Mesa, Ariz., starting April 24. He will be joined there by other London Olympians, including a United States rival, Ryan Lochte. Phelps announced his retirement at the end of the 2012 Olympics and became serious about golf, submitting to on-air instruction by the noted swing coach Hank Haney for Haney’s Golf Channel reality show.  After his record performance of eight gold medals at the Beijing Games in 2008, Phelps was adamant that the 2012 Olympics would be his last. In May 2009, he was lifting weights when the television in the weight room flashed a picture of quarterback Brett Favre, who was considering coming out of retirement a second time. Phelps summoned his coach, Bob Bowman, pointed at Favre’s picture on the television and said, “That will never be me.”  Phelps on occasion worked out last year with Bowman’s swimmers at North Baltimore Aquatic Club, but seldom completed more than 3,000 meters, a third of his training mileage when he was preparing for international competition. Last June, Bowman said that Phelps was swimming to keep his weight down and not with an eye toward the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, which would be Phelps’s fifth.  He did not discount the possibility that Phelps would be back. “Part of me feels that Mozart should make music as long as he wants to make music,” Bowman said. “Swimming is Michael’s gift, and if he wants to use it, he should.”",

        "article": "Jack Cooley scored 17 points in the Irish's upset bid over top-ranked Syracuse.  A few thoughts on Saturday's crop of college hoops:  Notre Dame 67, Syracuse 58: OK, it certainly isn't going down in the annals of Irish hoops' lore as being on a par with Digger Phelps' John Shumate-led club throttling the Bill Walton-led and John Wooden-coached UCLA Bruins' 88-game win streak in South Bend nearly 38 years ago. But, considering this Notre Dame team has been playing without the program's best player since Tim Ambromaitis suffered a torn ACL during a practice the day after Thanksgiving and had dropped two Big East games over the previous six days, coach Mike Brey and his crew couldn't have asked for a niftier way to improve to 12-8.  The program's eighth victory over a top-ranked foe came against a Syracuse squad that had won only five times by margins of fewer than 10 points while zipping to a 20-0 start.  The Orange played without sophomore center Fab Melo (7.2 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.0 blocked shots per game) -- he didn't make the trip, for which Coach Jim Boeheim refused to reveal the reason -- but it's doubtful his presence would have been enough to overcome an Irish offense that hit 50 percent from the field, including eight of 16 behind the arc.  No one yet should start questioning Boeheim's team's status as best in the Big East and a firm contender to get to the Final Four -- assuming Melo isn't off the floor for an extending period.  The result did much, much more to help Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament at-large bid possibilities than it did to alter the consensus of opinion on the Orange.  Florida State 76, Duke 73: Exactly two weeks before Leonard Hamilton's Seminoles took the Cameron Indoor Stadium floor Saturday for their ACC game against the Blue Devils, they were bopped around to the tune of 79-59 at Clemson, their third loss in four games and sixth in 10.  Since then they edged host Virginia Tech by four points, nuked North Carolina by 33 -- I repeat, 33 -- points in Tallahassee and methodically dominated visiting Maryland by 14 points.  Oh, yes: They left that Cameron Indoor Stadium floor a few hours later after Michael Snaer's transition three-pointer from the right wing, after a snap pass from Luke Loucks, zinged the nets as the buzzer sounded, jolting the Duke Crazies to near-silence and snuffing the Blue Devils' 45-game win streak in the building.  What a difference 14 days can make: The Seminoles, since that thumping in Clemson, are in a first-place tie (at 4-1) with the Blue Devils. The moral for those who follow college hoops? How about \"Judge thee, not too harshly, a team a week into January\"?  Missouri 89, Baylor 88: Until Michael Snaer's Jump Shot of the Week a couple of hours later in Durham, NC, the Tigers appeared to have a stranglehold on the Road Victory of the Week after knocking off the Bears in Waco.  Not to worry, though: That return trip to Columbia was just fine with an 18-1 record -- 5-1 in the Big 12 -- in tow.  How does a team hit 57 percent from the floor and score 88 points and still drop its second game in a row (the Bears were handed their first loss of the season Monday, Kansas doing the honors in Lawrence, 92-74)? By committing 19 turnovers, allowing the Tigers to shoot 54.5 percent from the field (including 23 of 34 inside the arc) and fouling enough to give Frank Haith's masters of \"beating people off the dribble\" the opportunity to hit 22 of 31 free throws.  The Jayhawks hit 35 of 61 from the field Monday night against Scott Drew's team.  We can guess what Drew will emphasize in practice before the Bears go to Norman for a Wednesday night game against Oklahoma.  Kansas 69, Texas 66: Senior point guard Tyshawn Taylor has been on the blunt end of a lot of criticism for his inconsistent -- erratic, if you will -- play for the Jayhawks.  But Bob Cousy Award voters, coach Bill Self and Jayhawk Nation had to be mightily impressed with Taylor's performances Saturday in Austin and Monday night in Lawrence.  Taylor had 22 points, five rebounds, four assists and no turnovers in 34 minutes Saturday -- six days after going for 28, two, six and five in 33 during the defeat of Baylor.  If Taylor plays anything close to that same level while teammate Thomas Robinson continues on his path to the John R. Wooden Award, the Jayhawks' ambitions will rightfully extend well beyond a Big 12 title.  Kentucky 77, Alabama 71: Coach John Calipari and the Wildcats didn't know it at the time, but the Wildcats' down-to-the wire SEC victory over the visiting Crimson Tide was going to be enough to move them to the top of the newest national ratings.  Anthony Davis hit just two of 10 shots from the field, but the likely National Freshman of the Year -- and very possible SEC Player of the Year -- impacted the game in significant other ways via his nine rebounds, four steals, four blocked shots and countless \"shot alterations.\"  The free-throw performance -- 27 of 40 -- was of the so-so variety but just good enough to keep poll voters from having a really difficult decision to make on Monday.  Tennessee 60, Connecticut 57: The defending national champions may have more \"talent,\" per se, than the Huskies possessed while going 11-0 in Big East and NCAA Tournament play last spring. After their second loss in a row Saturday in Knoxville -- and fourth in six games -- that theory is moot right now.  On an afternoon when one of the nation's most touted freshmen (Andre Drummond) and one of the players who led the Huskies to that national title (Alex Oriakhi) were on the floor, the best big man in the game was clearly another freshman -- mid-year high school graduate Jarnell Stokes (16 points and 12 rebounds), who made his college debut against Kentucky seven days before.  So much for enduring periods of adjustment ...  West Virginia 77, Cincinnati 74 (OT): Ladies and gentlemen meet the hottest team in the Big East right now. Coach Bob Huggins' Mountaineers can make that claim after their fifth win in six games since they lost by 19 points at Seton Hall two days before New Year's.  Is WVU senior forward Kevin Jones (26 points and 13 rebounds Saturday against Huggins' former program) the best player in the Big East? A compelling argument could be made in behalf of that suggestion.  Louisville 73, Pittsburgh 62: Just when it seemed as if the outlook for the rest of the season couldn't get any dimmer for Jamie Dixon's Panthers, they fell to 0-7 in Big East play, dropping their eighth game in a row overall with the home defeat to the Cardinals.  Rick Pitino's team has done a remarkable job in dealing with a lot of injuries to win three of seven conference games and, at 15-5 overall, be in solid NCAA Tourney at-large bid position.  The Panthers? Barring a Connecticut-like run through the Big East Tournament, they're going to be part of the NIT field. Who would have imagined that a month ago?  Murray State 82, Southern Illinois-Edwardsville 65: Raise your hands if you looked at Murray State's schedule in October and thought \"Here's a team that might be unbeaten\"?  The Racers are the last of the unbeatens after their 20th victory, the eighth in Ohio Valley Conference play, Saturday night.  First-year head coach Steve Prohm must be thinking, \"It's got to get tougher from here, right?\"  UNLV 80, New Mexico 63: Well, it had all the appearances of a \"Mountain West showdown\" -- for a half, at least, before the Rebels dispensed with the Lobos.  Coach Steve Alford's team has five games to play before getting a rematch with San Diego State (which beat the Lobos Wednesday night in Albuquerque) and they would be prudent to win at least four of them to stay in reasonable NCAA tourney at-large range.  As for the Rebels, they're playing for the best possible tournament seed -- regardless of what happens in the conference's postseason tourney on their home court.  Long Beach State 71, UC Santa Barbara 48: There appears to be a major gap between the two best teams in the Big West Conference -- at least that was the case Saturday night in Santa Barbara, when the 49ers built a 31-point edge with about 10 minutes left to go 7-0 in conference and 14-6 overall.  Perimeter players Casper Ware, Larry Anderson and James Ennis combined for 47 points, 11 rebounds, 12 assists with just four turnovers for Dan Monson's Long Beach squad while the Gauchos' Orlando Johnson was held to four of 15 shooting and 10 points.  The reason the Gauchos aren't panicking, though: They've beaten the 49ers in consecutive conference tourney title games, doing so last March after losing to Long Beach by margins of 16 and 18 points in the regular season.",

        "article": "If confidence were everything, then Usher would be acclaimed the king of all Broadway for his performance in Chicago, the long-running revival of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical at the Ambassador Theater. Making his New York stage debut in the role of Billy Flynn, a veteran criminal lawyer with an oil slick for a tongue and a cash register for a heart, this hugely popular R&B star is cast so hard against type, you would think you would hear him cracking from the collision.  After all, Usher, who at 27 still looks as if he might be carded for buying beer, has the face and voice of a choirboy entertaining (and enjoying) impure thoughts. And if many of the songs from his Confessions, the 2004 CD that has sold more than 15 million copies, exude sexual swagger, they also speak pleadingly of a bruiseable soul beneath, of a heartbroken heartbreaker. For Billy Flynn, a soul is something you order meunière, preferably at your clients expense.  Whats more, when this Billy, in a droll paean to the joys of his lucrative profession, sings that all he cares about is love, you believe him. Such a response was surely the last thing from the minds of the creators of Chicago.  The sweetly sung notes, precisely executed serpentine dance moves and wooden line readings in Ushers performance are shaded by a big awning of a smile that reads like a standing invitation to a perpetual private party.  If you want to know the source of that smile, check out the last line of Ushers Playbill biography, in which he says, Knowing there is still love for me in the marketplace gives me energy. Or, as another character in the show, the fame-hungry Roxie Hart (Bianca Marroquin), puts it, I love the audience, and the audience loves me for loving them.  With his beaming and unshakable self-assurance, Usher registers none of the raw neediness of poor old Roxie, who is played with unsettling sincerity by Ms. Marroquin. In his relationship with the audience (a k a the marketplace), he brings to mind the most popular boy in high school, running for class president. His knowing hes a shoo-in does not stop him from glad-handing tirelessly and making all the right speeches. Its hard not to like the guy. Which goes to prove that its possible to like someone and be bored by him at the same time.  This revival, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in November, has definitely seen livelier days. But it probably wouldnt be alive at all without the, shall we say, imaginative casting practices of its hands-on producers, Barry and Fran Weissler. Usher is only the latest of many Billy Flynns to walk the stage in this revival: a parade including James Naughton (who won a Tony for it), Robert Urich, Taye Diggs and Huey Lewis. (Lets not even get started on the list of Roxies.) Usher is surely the most famous of them to date. And unlike Mr. Lewis, who peaked as a chart-topping pop star two decades ago, he has not even begun to wane as a hot property.  But once the chorus of loud, swoony screams that greets his entrance subsides, Usherites dont get much chance to exercise their lungs again. Their idol wears a black tie as if he had been born in one. He sings agreeably, mostly resisting the temptation to impose his trademark R&B inflections. And he dances in the style of Bob Fosse, whose original choreography from 1975 has been re-envisioned by Ann Reinking, without any missteps.  Yet lacking a natural affinity for Mr. Fosses double-edged show-biz cynicism  and a sense of the original matinee-idol crooner being parodied here  Usher doesnt generate the kind of energy that keeps em shrieking in concerts. Instead of the white-hot radiance you expect from a star at his peak, you get a sustained glow of geniality. Usher doesnt make the mistake of trying too hard, but it might be more interesting if he did.  As if to compensate, the rest of the principal cast members work overtime in selling their numbers, and you can feel the strain. Lillias White, a Tony winner for The Life, milks every hard-sell gospel lick she can from her solo as Mama Morton, the prison matron. Brenda Braxton animatedly goes through the motions of the ambitious jailbird-chorine Velma Kelly, but without finding a character to play.  As Roxies neglected husband, Kevin Chamberlin turns Mr. Cellophane into an affectingly quiet nervous breakdown that really belongs in another show. And the lissome Ms. Marroquin (who played Roxie in Mexico City) displays a similar emotional earnestness that this supremely arch show cant always accommodate. Kept on a tighter rein, though, she and Mr. Chamberlin could both be first-rate.  As it is, this is not a production that rivets the attention. The jokes often deflate from over- or underemphasis. The timing throughout goes slack. Even the orchestra sounds a bit ragged. So, understandably, the mind drifts a bit, perhaps to consider the possibilities of new adventures in casting, via the Weisslers. The presence of Usher has instantly revitalized the box office for Chicago, so you know that this husband-and-wife team is plotting the next series of revenue-magnet moves.  Of course, if Chicago runs another 10 years, we can expect the has-beens of tomorrow (Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson and the like) to make inevitable appearances. But what about extending the borders of celebrity casting into fuller themes? There could be a silver Chicago (with Beatrice Arthur and Elaine Stritch as Velma and Roxie, and Kitty Carlisle Hart as Mama Morton); a gay Chicago (with Rupert Everett and Lance Bass as Vernon Kelly and Robbie Hart); even a kabbalah Chicago (with Madonna and Demi Moore); or a Scientology version (with Katie Holmes, Kirstie Alley and  dare we hope?  Tom Cruise as the ultimate Billy Flynn).  On second thought, lets not go there. It all sounds entirely too plausible.",

The suspects in this month's attacks face charges of aggravated arson, but federal authorities are investigating them for connections with organized crime, Guanajuato state prosecutors said.  To prevent further attacks, state authorities were guarding 10 of the company's warehouses on Tuesday in Michoacan, a Knights Templar stronghold, Notimex reported.  Sabritas said it was working with authorities to investigate the attacks.  \"The company is taking all the necessary measure to re-establish the operation as soon as possible (in the affected distribution centers). Sabritas reiterates that its priority will always be the safety of all its collaborators,\" the company said Monday.  Word of the attacks quickly spread in Mexico's business community, with the leader of at least one industry group saying seeing such a large company fall victim to violence could discourage others from investing in the country.  Already, amid widespread threats and extortion, many companies are devoting an increasing portion of their budgets to security, Sergio Cervantes Rodiles, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, told Notimex.  The head of another national business group condemned the attacks Tuesday and called on authorities to punish the perpetrators.  \"The hurting or threatening of companies, which are the principal generators of wealth and jobs in Mexico, must not be allowed under any circumstances,\" Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce President Jorge Davila Flores said in a statement.

        "article": "When I interviewed Oswald in 2012, she was compelling in everything she said, but it was only when I came to transcribe our conversation later that I realised she had spoken not only in full, delicately constructed sentences, but in entire off-the-cuff paragraphs of pristine prose.  In speech, her mind is finely geared to the way her words will come out on paper, but you can tell that she writes first by speaking, listening and thinking. When you read Oswald, it’s hard to resist imagining how her poems would sound aloud. They expand far beyond paper.  “I do very much believe in poetry as a kind of tune or music,” she said to me then, as we discussed her forthcoming performance of the book-length 2011 poem Memorial, an elegiac list of the 200 soldiers who die in the Iliad, embellished with Homer’s similes. The epithets make each warrior a more rounded character, a life easy to mourn: “SCAMANDRIUS the hunter/ Knew every deer in the woods”.  Oswald performed Memorial from memory, in its entirety, on several occasions. It was a visibly exhausting tour-de-force. She said: “In a kind of superstitious way, I feel that for those names actually to be sounded out loud is even more than for them to be written on a page. It’s a kind of giving of life back to those people.” This is poetry that works like a spell.  Although Falling Awake is a collection rather than a single, book-length poem – the form she used for Dart and Memorial, and which has brought her greatest acclaim – it does contain one extraordinary extended piece, “Tithonus”.  In Greek myth, the dawn (Eos) fell in love with Tithonus, a man, and asked the gods to make him immortal. She forgot to specify eternal youth. Tithonus did indeed live forever, but became enfeebled and senseless, and had to be locked away.  Oswald’s poem imagines Tithonus meeting the dawn at midsummer. It was written to be heard in initial darkness, the lights coming on very slowly. In 2014, Oswald performed it at the Southbank Centre and it lasted 46 minutes, the length of a midsummer dawn.  “Tithonus” is a poem about youth, age, folly and the unstoppable mechanisms of the natural world that mark out our time on Earth: “as for the sparrows I’ve been/ watching them embroider their/ indecisions in brown stitches until/ the whole valley is darned/ then leaving their dusty jackets on/ the ground/ and then another life and then another”. Even on paper it’s hypnotic.  “Tithonus” is an astonishing achievement and the most powerful piece in Falling Awake, coming at its end. But an obsession with dawn and twilight pervades the rest of the collection, hinting at death’s omnipresence in nature and in folklore. Oswald’s masterful telling of Tithonus’s life is the culmination of that argument, the man’s life robbed of meaning by his inability to die.  Throughout Falling Awake, the hours and the seasons, as well as the insistent course of river currents, are felt as the internal rhythms of the poetry. Everything in Oswald’s work pulses with these adopted natural rhythms. We find Orpheus in this collection, too, his severed head floating away down the River Hebron, a metaphor for Oswald’s writing: “my voice being water/ which holds me together and also carries me away”.  Here we also find “Dunt: A poem for a dried-up river”, which won the Forward Prize for best single poem in 2007. Oswald takes a statue of a Roman water nymph, found near the Dunt’s banks, as the starting point of her attempt to conjure the dried-up Gloucestershire river back into existence: “she tries to summon a river out of limestone”. It is meditative, repetitive and about as earthy a river poem as you’re likely to find – and a long way from a Romantic river sonnet.  It asks: what happens to a river when there is no water? What do you find in the depths of its bed? A river without much water starts to defy definition: “It’s a pitiable likeness of clear running/struggling to keep up with what’s already gone”. The poem is a coda to Dart, and though just as mesmerising, it’s blunter, shorter and uglier. It doesn’t progress easily, getting caught in its own repetitions, and has to be urged on with the refrain: “try again”.  Another outstanding poem in the book is “Fox”, a response to Ted Hughes’s “The Thought-Fox”. Oswald, like the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, is an admirer of Hughes. In 2014, she edited a volume of his animal poems, an exercise that left her with “an unusual brightness behind my eyes”, as she wrote in the preface. Although she felt that all the poems were “prayers to language itself”, she paid particular attention to “The Thought-Fox”, a poem that imagines encountering a fox at midnight (“cold, delicately as the dark snow/ A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;/ Two eyes serve a moment”). It explores the conflict in a poet between wildness and restraint, and the dark art of pinning an idea down to paper.  Oswald’s “Fox” takes place at the same time of day, but slinks down the page even more foxily: “a fox in her fox-fur/ stepping across/ the grass in her black gloves/ barked at my house… ” Her final stanza is as honest and vulnerable as a fox’s cry: “… it’s midnight/ and my life/ is laid beneath my children/ like gold leaf”. The “fox in her fox-fur” must dance the line between being sinuous and surviving.  The fox is now female. Oswald describes her as “a woman with a man’s voice”. And when poets mention voice, you pay attention. Hughes’s “The Thought-Fox” is about writing poetry, and so is Oswald’s pointedly feminine creature. That Oswald looks directly at gender in “Fox” comes as a tantalising surprise, because it isn’t her way, even though she has made career of writing powerfully about earth, strength and physicality – tropes many poets would earmark as masculine.",

        "article": "Blackie Sherrod, a sportswriter and editor who endeared himself to his Texas readers with a Southern strain of Runyonesque erudition, and to generations of younger reporters with his curmudgeonly mentoring, died on Thursday at his home in Dallas. He was 96.  His death was confirmed by his wife, Joyce, who said he had been suffering from dementia for 10 years and had declined rapidly after two recent falls.  Often compared to leading contemporaries like Red Smith and Jim Murray, Mr. Sherrod was less of a nationally known figure, but few sportswriters have left their mark on a region as Mr. Sherrod did in his home state. As the headline of his obituary in The Dallas Morning News declared, Mr. Sherrod (pronounced SHEHR-ud) was, in Texas parlance, a legend.  In a career of more than six decades, The News was his final employer, beginning in 1985 after his stints at two papers that are now defunct, The Fort Worth Press and The Dallas Times Herald. He was voted Texas sportswriter of the year 16 times.  “There have been about as many imitation Sherrods as there have been sportswriters who drink,” D, the Dallas city magazine, wrote in 1986. That was more than a decade after Texas Monthly published a profile of Mr. Sherrod titled “The Best Sportswriter in Texas,” written by Larry L. King, a Texas writer of some phrase-turning renown himself.  Mr. King recalled that at his first job, at a small paper in Midland, Tex., he routinely swiped lines from Mr. Sherrod for his own column, and that when he moved to a bigger paper in Odessa, a more senior writer “wigwagged me into a neutral corner to whisper that our newspaper wasn’t big enough for both of us to crib from Blackie Sherrod.”  A lively stylist, Mr. Sherrod was able, with a piquant phrase, to force a snort of laughter or, at times, an anguished tear; one of his best-known subjects was Freddie Joe Steinmark, a University of Texas safety on the 1969 national championship team who died of cancer less than two years later.  Not so much a direct critic of the sporting establishment, Mr. Sherrod was more likely to raise an eyebrow askance than to spit in outrage. And he wasn’t naturally inclined to delve into the economics of sports or issues like drug use by athletes.  But writing with an informed swagger and the perspective of a well-read man with wide-ranging interests, he was a shrewd analyst of the games who delicately toed a line as an appreciative nonworshiper of the people who played them. He referred to the Dallas Cowboys (and their blindly adoring fans) with a bit of snark as “Your Heroes,” and to Tom Landry, the impassive and often impenetrable longtime coach of the Cowboys, a man he liked and admired, as Mount Landry.  Once in the 1960s, when Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach rescued a last-minute victory with a deft final drive after playing poorly for most of the game, Mr. Sherrod described the feat as “like putting a cherry on a glass of buttermilk.”  In later years he was best known for a weekly column of brief observations called Scattershooting. “His face is a map of a hard path,” he wrote of Johnny Unitas, among the greatest quarterbacks, “forehead wrinkles, cascading furrows in his cheeks, small pock marks dotting his lean serious cheeks. He is a day laborer who somehow fell into fame on his way to work and it impresses him not a whit.”  William Forrest Sherrod was born on Nov. 9, 1919, on a farm in Bell County, Tex., near Belton, between Austin and Waco. His parents, Marvin Sherrod and the former Lorna Forrest, eventually gave up on farming, and his father made a living as a barber. As a boy, he said, he read every book in the Belton library.  He attended Baylor University before transferring to Howard Payne University, where he played football until he was injured. A coach, noting his black hair and dark complexion — he had Cherokee blood, his wife said — gave him the nickname Blackie, which he did not like but decided to use after an editor told him that readers would remember it. He served in the Navy in the Pacific theater in World War II.  At The Fort Worth Press, a penurious operation, he quickly rose to sports editor and held his young reporters to strict standards, castigating them regularly for tardiness, flowery writing, overseriousness and factual mistakes. Among his shrewd hires were Dan Jenkins, later a writer for Sports Illustrated and the author of the football novel “Semi-Tough,” among many other books, and Bud Shrake, another future Sports Illustrated contributor and novelist.  “I was scared to death of him at first,” Mr. Jenkins told Mr. King for the Texas Monthly profile. “My first story, I spent all night writing it at home on the kitchen table — cutting, polishing, making it bright. Blackie read the first paragraph and said, ‘Don’t ever write a morning lead for an afternoon newspaper, dumbass.’”  He moved to The Times Herald in 1958, and he was so well regarded by the paper and its readership that he was sent to Los Angeles for the 1960 Democratic National Convention, served as the rewrite man in the paper’s coverage of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963 and was dispatched to Cape Kennedy, now known as Cape Canaveral, as Americans landed on the moon in 1969.  Mr. Sherrod’s first marriage ended in divorce. He married Joyce Lowe Wilson in 1979. She is his only immediate survivor.  The legend of Blackie Sherrod was, in short, that of the hard-shelled newsman with a soft heart — or maybe it was the other way around. When Mr. King, finishing his magazine profile, told him he couldn’t find anyone to say a bad word about him, Mr. Sherrod advised him to talk to his enemies. And who are they? Mr. King asked.  “Screw you,” Mr. Sherrod said. “Get your own story.”  Reprinted from Sunday’s early editions.

        "article": "So many of us start the year with good intentions: to be healthier, to save more money, to take more holidays or spend less time online. But how many of our resolutions survive the month?  What you need is a plan, man. Guardian Australia found people who have succeeded at keeping their resolutions. Here is their advice.  Just over three years ago, when I was feeling low, I deactivated my Facebook profile. The relationship between social media and anxiety is slowly being fleshed out by academics, but I knew it intimately: Facebook made me miserable.This seems to be the story for more and more people: the quality of their time on Facebook has vastly diminished since they first started using the service. Many feel trapped. But giving it up? “No way,” everyone tells me, “I hate Facebook and I want to quit, but ... ”  “I use it to keep in touch with friends overseas”  Do you use Instagram or Twitter? Do you have an iPhone and can you use iMessage? Are you familiar with Whatsapp, Skype, Dropbox, and ... the telephone? Think about it: you don’t need Facebook to keep in touch. What’s more, getting rid of it actually improves your interactions with your overseas friends because you’re not constantly smothered in their photos and status updates.  “Don’t you miss out on stuff?”  Repeat after me: I am not a slave to “Fomo”. You already miss out on plenty of events: all the Facebook invitations you click “maybe” on and then don’t attend. So abandon your fear.  After quitting Facebook, what you will miss out on is the sense of anxiety that accompanies endless invitations to parties at which you’d rather not make an appearance. And if your friends want you to be somewhere, they’ll tell you. The invitations won’t dry up – your friends actually do like you.  “What about Facebook-stalking/perving on crushes/my unhealthy obsession with other peoples’ lives?”  This is the reason you wanted to quit Facebook in the first place! The constant “passive” communication of status updates and photos is what gives you “Facebook anxiety” because you’re viewing a curated version of other people’s lives.  And think of the flipside: chance encounters with people you’d rather keep at arms’ length become locked in once they fire off a friend request. How many chance acquaintances are stalking your profile right now?  “I need it for work/to use Tinder”  Create a separate profile and don’t add your friends on it. If they try to add you, reject ruthlessly. Put in your bio that you are only using it for administration.  “Mum and Dad love it and my family uses it to share photos”  Youth of the world: you are stronger than your baby-boomer relatives. Teach them how to use a different photo-sharing service and wrestle your family interactions back on to your terms. Plus: no more chime-ins from the parentals.  “I can’t seem to stop using it, it’s a habit I can’t break”  To break your compulsive Facebook usage, take a lesson from the best. The Catholic sect Opus Dei encourages its members to start the day with an “heroic minute”, getting out of bed immediately upon waking and declaring “Serviam!” (I will serve).  According to one social media website, 50% of young Facebook users habitually check their profile first thing in the morning, so distracting yourself with your real life could be a good move. If the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, you could try an app like Mac Freedom, which blocks access to websites on your desktop computer. And delete the app from your phone – that should go without saying.  The benefits of being Facebook-free are great: no more racist status updates from school friends, a bit more headspace, an improvement in your real-life interactions with your real-life friends (you’ll actually have news to talk about!) and best of all, more time to spend on things that matter, like Twitter.  Adam’s resolution for 2015: to quit smoking for the umpteenth time.  Decluttering is one of the simpler new year’s goals to execute. Weight can come back, fitness can fade; once you’ve binned your old trainers, encyclopaedias and that souvenir obelisk you picked up in Cairo, they’re not coming back, ever.  First, the cleanse. Clothes are easy. You fought the establishment during your commerce-law degree at university and your surplus military green army jacket proves it. Now it makes you look like a pipe bomber. Bin it.  It’s an old rule, but worth heeding: if you can’t picture wearing something in a social setting in the next 12 months, get rid of it. The initial trepidation will fade, I promise. The clutter you’re really clearing is mental.  Ask the same hard questions about your sentimental objects. The saturated beer mat your dropkick mates pinched during a first-year pub crawl once took pride of place. Now the memories are stale – and so is the smell. Replace it with something fresh and meaningful.  If you can’t chuck it out, find a way to shrink it. Does that framed picture of your late 90s trip to Bali still stoke warm memories? Ditch the frame and file away the photograph in an accordion envelope.  That’s part two: the system. Accordion envelopes are cheap and come with alphabetical stickers you can spend your Saturday evening putting in place. Anything important to which you might later need to refer – leases, contracts, forms – can be filed away. A is for applications. B is for blueprints. C is for congratulations: now you’re an adult.  Have a place on your desk for bills. Chuck them when they’re paid or store them in a manila folder you can throw out once enough time passes. Buy a little box for chargers or wrap them around a bulldog clip attached to the end of your desk. Hang your shirts facing the same direction (and the coat hangers all pointing inwards). The line between organised and obsessive-compulsive is a fine one. Don’t be afraid to push it.  The point is that the few, quality things you own should have a place. Remember: what you’re really organising is your head.  Michael’s resolution for 2015: have no more than nine tabs open in Chrome.  Buying your first property is no easy task.  There are auctions to contend with, real estate agents to be courted by, other eager first-home buyers to square off with at open for inspections. But perhaps the hardest part of the process is saving enough money for a deposit. Let’s be clear: this is not going to happen with a bit of belt-tightening and fewer takeaway meals each week.  The sixth annual Bankwest First Time Buyer Deposit Report, released in December, revealed it will take 6.7 years for first-time buyers in Sydney to save a 20% home deposit of $165,100 for a median-priced property of around $800,000.  This is not to suggest it is impossible; in fact, if you are buying a cheaper one-bedroom unit or are looking to buy in the regions, things suddenly get a whole lot easier. Nevertheless, you will need to be disciplined and self-motivated and, more often than not, give up a few luxuries you enjoy (week after week, month after month).  The first step is to work out exactly how much money you will need for a deposit, which is usually 20% of the purchase price. It is possible to enter the market with a 10 or even a 5% deposit but it will mean you have to pay mortgage lender’s insurance. You will also need to factor in other costs, such as stamp duty prices, conveyancing and legal costs, as well as pest and building inspections.  Next you should open a high-interest savings account and direct debit part of your pay to the account each week until your deposit figure is reached. Set six-monthly savings milestones and when you hit that figure treat yourself to something indulgent and expensive.  If you are keen to get on the property ladder sooner, you could move back into the family home or swap your rental for a share house. If all else fails, you could ask your family to go guarantor in place of an actual deposit. But word to the wise: saving for a deposit is the perfect test for how disciplined you will be when it comes to making mortgage repayments. If you struggle at that point, then perhaps the rigidity of the 30-year mortgage isn’t for you.  Johanna’s resolution for 2015: to spend more time travelling.

        "article": "UPPER TOWNSHIP, N.J. — Tonia Ahern’s phone rings and buzzes at all hours with calls, texts and e-mails from parents desperate for guidance on how to help their heroin-addicted children.  “All day long,” she said. “All day long.”  Ahern isn’t a doctor or a counselor — she is the parent of a man who has battled heroin addiction for years. As the number of people who are abusing heroin skyrockets across the country, Ahern and others have created a grass-roots network that helps addicts and their parents navigate the labyrinthine world of drug treatment and the criminal justice system.  “It shocked me the way things went down and the lack of information I had available, and I like to think of myself as a fairly informed person,” said Felicia Miceli of Medina, Ill. Her son Louie died of a heroin overdose at 24; another son battled heroin addiction and is now clean.  Miceli felt she had to do something — anything — to try to prevent others from using the drug. The month after Louie died she created the Louis Theodore Miceli Heroin Awareness and Support Foundation. The nonprofit takes recovering addicts into schools, where they talk about the dangers of heroin.  “Honestly to channel the grief that I feel, I had to do something with it,” she said. “I can’t live without just channeling this.”  Like many parents confronted with a child who has spiraled into heroin addiction, Ahern didn’t know where to go or what to do. She scoured the Internet and found the New Jersey Parent to Parent Coalition, a group founded by four women; three of them lost a child to an overdose.  Ahern said the group made her realize that thousands of other families were going through a similar situation. She started advocating for the widespread use of Naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose, in New Jersey. Ahern is now a presence at the state capitol, lobbying legislators to devote more resources to treatment. She is not working because a full-time job would be impossible with the work she is doing with the families of people using heroin. Her son is doing well and hasn’t used the drug for months.  “In the middle of the night we’re talking to people, we’re trying to help parents, we’re trying to help people get into treatment,” she said. “People who understand, who are going to through it, really have compassion and empathy for other people.”  This weekend Ahern and thousands of others are expected to descend on Washington for Unite to Face Addiction, a rally to bring people struggling with addiction out of the shadows. It will launch a national advocacy group to combat heroin addiction.  Fed Up!, the group that Judy Rummler created after her son died of an overdose, will hold a rally Saturday in Washington. Rummler said she did not know the extent of the epidemic of overdoses when her son died and wanted to try to stop the number of overdoses and lobby local and federal government in memory of her son. In her home state of Minnesota, Rummler spearheaded a law named after her son that limits liability and provides criminal immunity for people who call the police if they are with someone who has overdosed.  “It’s enabled people to feel or to understand that it’s okay to talk about this. It used to be swept under the rug,” she said. “The more of us that speak out … people will know that this can happen to anybody.”  Patty DiRenzo of Blackwood, N.J., lost her son to an overdose in 2010. Since then she has advocated for the state’s Naloxone law, which went into effect in 2014, and worked to connect patients with treatment and parents with one another.  “We are the only ones that understand it,” she said. “It’s a separate private community of people who have lost children. We’re there to lend our hands to guide other family members through the process where they can get their children the help they need when we couldn’t.”",

        "article": "GEORGE H. W. BUSH was the first politician I ever disliked. I was 12, my parents were loyal Democrats, and every night we’d watch the news, cheer for whatever Bill Clinton was saying on the trail, and then glower at the screen when Peter Jennings went to Brit Hume, then the White House correspondent, for an update on what the incumbent president was up to.  For a kid new to politics, in a family that regarded Republicans as stuffed shirts and black hats, the fact that the elder Bush had been elected president was simply baffling. His voice, his affect, his malapropisms, his endless forehead — they reminded me of a stiff in one of the black-and-white films my parents watched, or the Token Clueless Grown-up in a kids’ adventure movie. Watching him nightly, I kept thinking: How could anyone like this guy?  One answer, I learned later, was that relatively few people really did. Not that Bush hadn’t earned his share of admirers across his distinguished career. But by the standards of modern presidents he lacked a truly passionate fan base. The conservative movement was perpetually disappointed in him; liberals gave him no credit for his moderation; the press never swooned for him; and few voters bonded with him the way they did with the beloved Reagan, the charismatic Clinton – or even, eventually, with a more populist and swaggering President Bush.  So my 12-year-old self’s political instincts weren’t all wrong. The elder Bush had many gifts, but he was not a particularly appealing politician.  Neither, it turns out, is his second son. We’ve reached the last stand of the Jeb Bush campaign, the make-or-break moment, and unless New Hampshire delivers a dramatic surprise his $100 million juggernaut is just days or weeks away from breaking down. And in many ways, the Jeb! campaign has recapitulated his father’s struggle to play the modern presidential part.  The father had “the wimp factor,” his second son has “low energy.” The father struggled to deal with a billionaire populist; so too has the son. (Perot then, Trump now.) The father’s inspirational gestures (“a thousand points of light”) were less memorable than his crime-and-culture assault on Michael Dukakis; the son’s promise to run a “joyful” campaign has collapsed into a wave of negative ads. The father famously told a New Hampshire audience, “message: I care.” The son finished a recent town-hall peroration with the instantly immortal “please clap.”  The difference is that the father had better fortune before his ’92 defeat. The father got to run for Ronald Reagan’s third term in 1988, whereas Jeb has the anchor of his brother’s unsuccessful administration. The father faced Bob Dole and Dukakis; his son has more politically effective rivals. (There’s more than a hint of Clinton in Marco Rubio.) And the elder Bush was better served by his hatchet men, Lee Atwater and James Baker, than Jeb has been by Mike Murphy’s super PAC, whose most memorable attack ad involved Rubio’s … boots.  So unless something dramatic changes, Bush family history will have repeated itself — the first time as a rise and fall, the second time just as a flop.  But before it does, it’s worth recalling that after he was ejected from the White House, people realized that actually George H. W. Bush had been a pretty good president.  Not a transformative one, to be sure; not an ideological hero in the mold of Reagan or Franklin Roosevelt. But precisely because the elder Bush lacked certain politicians’ gifts, he also lacked certain characteristic politicians’ weaknesses — the appetitive indiscipline of his successor, the headstrong utopianism of his son, the polarizing arrogance of our present chief executive.  Which meant that while his presidency left no major domestic policy legacy, it also bequeathed few disasters, and left the economy in good shape for its 1990s boom. His foreign policy built on Reagan’s achievements, but Bush presided successfully over an extraordinarily fraught four years (the Berlin Wall, the invasion of Kuwait, the fall of the Soviet Union) and left office with U.S. interests arguably stronger than at any point in modern history.  As a case for his son, this is not the stuff of 30-second ads: I share my dad’s weaknesses as a politician, so maybe I’d actually be a pretty good president. I’m Jeb Bush and I approve this message.  But the funny thing is, it might be true. Jeb has proven, over many painful months, that he lacks the gifts required to win a primary campaign. But the democratic process is hardly infallible, and a great deal of damage can be done by presidents rich in political charisma — and with it zeal, self-righteousness and certainty.  Between Cruz, Rubio, Hillary and Bernie — to say nothing of Donald Trump — there’s a lot of those qualities to go around. Which makes me fear that we could do a lot worse than John Ellis Bush. And that we probably will.  Now, before he goes — please clap.",

        "article": "Incandescent light bulbs are on the way out by 2012, thanks to Congress, meaning for now at least that compact fluorescent lamps are on the rise. The spiral-shaped tubes last longer and use much less electricity than conventional bulbs, both good things. But they contain small amounts of the neurotoxin mercury, a bad thing.  Compact fluorescents are supposed to be recycled so that the mercury (which is in vapor form) can be dealt with properly. But the tubes do occasionally crack or break, and the recycling rate is currently low, so mercury could be released in homes or elsewhere, posing a small risk to children.  Robert H. Hurt, an engineering professor at Brown University, along with a student, Natalie C. Johnson, and others, set out to see what could be done to reduce the risk. They report in Environmental Science and Technology that they have developed a material that can capture the mercury released from a broken tube.  The researchers experimented with tiny particles of sulfur, copper, nickel and other elements to see how well mercury was absorbed onto them. Selenium, in particular, has a well-known affinity for mercury, and the researchers found that particles of it with a size from about 10 to 600 nanometers were capable of binding with almost all of the mercury from a lamp.  The researchers say this “nanoselenium,” impregnated in cloth, could be used in packaging for new lamps (in case of breakage during shipment) or for cleaning up a broken lamp in the home. Plastic bags used to hold recycled compact fluorescents could also be treated with the material.

        "article": "At the Bello Monte morgue in Caracas, the smell of death reeks out from the buildings to the surrounding streets and to the dozens of people waiting on the sidewalks to collect the corpses of their loved ones. The odor of the rotting bodies is so strong because of power cuts hitting the air conditioning and the sheer number of cadavers. Every half hour or so, ambulances arrive with new corpses, the vast majority of them homicide victims. The morgue serves the whole of Caracas, which has become one of the most murderous cities on the planet.  “The violence has got worse and worse. It is a devastating situation. There are killers everywhere,” said Jose Medina, a 51-year-old musician, who was sat outside the morgue, waiting to collect the body of his cousin. Gunmen had shot his cousin dead in a taxi he drove in an apparent robbery, Medina said. “It has got dangerous to just be on the street. Many of us stay indoors at night, imposing a curfew on ourselves.”  The country’s runaway murder rate is just one of the factors driving opposition to President Nicolas Maduro in a country where shortages of food and basic goods are chronic, inflation is running rampant and the government is jailing political prisoners. But it serves as a bloody illustration of just how close to outright societal collapse Venezuela has come since the end of the 20th century, as gangs, guerrillas and militia defend their turfs and traditional authority structures fall by the wayside.  There is fierce debate about exactly how many people are murdered in Venezuela, but all sources find sky-high rates. The government says there were almost 18,000 murders in this South American nation last year, giving it a rate of 58 homicides per 100,000 – compared to 4 in the United States. The independent Venezuelan Violence Observatory claims there were really almost 28,000 murders. An annual comparative survey classified Caracas as the most homicidal city outside a declared warzone in 2015, with 119 homicides per 100,000.  Against this backdrop, opposition leaders are attempting to bring to an end 17 years of rule by the socialist party of the late Hugo Chavez. This month, opposition leaders, who now control the congress, presented almost two million signatures for a referendum on Maduro’s rule. A survey found more than 60 percent of Venezuelans said they would vote him out, and only 28 percent would vote for him to continue.  The Venezuelan government has so far stalled on acting on the petition, while Maduro has declared a state of emergency and claimed dark forces are trying to destabilize the country. “We are victims of the worst media, political and diplomatic threats to our country in the last ten years,” Maduro said Tuesday. Opposition leaders have called on Venezuelans to ignore the state of emergency and march in support of the referendum.  The descent began almost twenty years ago. When Chavez took power in Venezuela in 1999 and launched his so-called “Bolivarian revolution,” he echoed the socialist programs of socialist ally Cuba in investing in poorer communities, running literacy campaigns and setting up health clinics with Cuban doctors. More equality, he hoped, would lead to less crime — as it has in the island nation, which has a homicide rate similar to that of the United States.  But in Cuba, the Castro government tamped down violence by building a powerful, heavy-handed police force and clamping down on illegal guns. In Venezuela, by contrast, Chavez criticized the police for being repressive, while his hardcore supporters formed their own armed groups ostensibly to fight crime. Roberto Briceno, a sociologist who heads the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, says the tactic weakened law enforcement and led to increasing chaos on the streets. “There has been a destruction of the institutions, a breaking of social rules,” Briceno says. “There are armed groups the police know they can’t touch.”  At the same time, Venezuela has seen the growth of the criminal gangs that plague much of Latin America, and other armed political forces, from both the left and right. There are drug cartels with links to the security forces, several leftist guerrilla groups, right wing paramilitary forces opposed to the socialist government, and heavily-armed street gangs. This tangle of competing gunmen has proven a lethal cocktail. In Chavez’s first year of rule, the observatory counted close to 6,000 homicides in Venezuela. In 2013, the year Chavez died and his hand-picked successor Maduro took over, it counted more than 24,000 – rising to the nearly 28,000 it tallied last year.  Many poor barrios in Caracas and across Venezuela have seen an expansion of street gangs, who sell drugs, carry out armed robberies and commit heinous amounts of murders. Unlike the cartel armies of Mexico, the Venezuelan gangs often have just a few dozen members and control a few blocks. But they possess potent weaponry including fragmentation grenades, automatic rifles and even anti-tank guns.  In a slum known for drug selling in west central Caracas, a gang leader known as El Gocho agreed to talk to TIME. At 40 years old, Gocho has been in gangs since he was 15, saying he first made money selling drugs so that he could support his mother. He now heads about 30 cohorts hawking packets of cocaine along several streets, which are known as good trafficking real estate.  As he controls a profitable business in a country going through a severe economic crisis, he says he is constantly dealing with rival gangsters trying to invade his turf. “There are crazy people out there trying to kill me all the time, and take over this area. People who want to cut you up in pieces and burn your body with gasoline,” he said. “That is why we need to have big guns to defend ourselves, and watch whoever is coming into this area.”  Similar gangs crisscross Caracas, creating frontlines between rivals every few blocks, and Gocho says he faces enemies on all sides. He has bullet wounds from several shootings that he survived and admits to killing various rival gangsters.  Gocho says he buys the cocaine wholesale from Colombians operating in Caracas and sells it in small packets to users. Venezuela rarely produces its own cocaine, but Colombian traffickers have been arrested here, using the country as a transit route for drugs going to Europe and the United States as well as selling locally.  The traffickers sometimes work with Venezuelan officials. In February, a Venezuelan army major was arrested with 503 kilos of cocaine. Even more controversially in November, police in Haiti working with agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration arrested a nephew and stepson of President Maduro himself on drug charges. They are currently in the United States where they have pleaded innocence.  A few miles through Caracas in another poor barrio, the head of a “pro-Chavista” group who calls himself Comandante Cienfuegos sits in a heavily armored bunker. A muscular former paratrooper, Cienfuegos asked not to use his real name as he also confessed to carrying out murders, saying that he kills criminals who sell drugs or steal in his neighborhood.  “That is the way we deal with this scum. We go out there with guns and masks on and eliminate the threat,” Cienfuegos said, sitting in front of a mural of revolutionary Che Guevara. “We are the worst nightmare of these rats.”  Cienfuegos was a longtime supporter of Chavez, who he refers to as “our father creator.” In 1992, while a paratrooper, Cienfuegos joined Chavez in his attempted coup against then President Carlos Andres Perez. When the coup failed he served three months in prison; Chavez himself was incarcerated for two years before he was released and went on to win the presidency.  When supporters of Chavez formed the armed community groups, known as collectives, the socialist government largely tolerated them, rarely seizing their guns or raiding their bunkers. Cienfuegos claims there are now about 8,000 such militants in Venezuela, mostly in the Caracas area, although there is no official registry.  Cienfuegos personally commands about 40 cohorts to operate their alternative policing of his barrio. He says they will first warn a criminal or break their legs, but if they keep committing crime they will “execute” them. He says that local businesses pay them to keep the criminals out. “They are happy for us to be here. The police don’t keep the barrio clean so we are needed,” he said. Opponents of the collectives say it is more akin to extortion.  Cienfuegos sympathizes with the various leftist guerrilla groups in Venezuela, including the Bolivarian Liberation Force, or FBL. While operating illegally, the FBL supports the socialist government. On the other side, he is on red alert for right wing paramilitaries, who have spilled over from neighboring Colombia.  Several Colombian paramilitary figures have been arrested in Venezuela, and the government claims they are a growing force, extorting businesses and murdering socialist organizers. The paramilitaries, “are financed with money from hard drugs, with dollars, to bring war to all the urban communities in the principal cities of our country,” Maduro said last week.  In the midst so many competing gunmen, the police struggle to keep control on the murderous streets. TIME rode with a unit from Miranda State police patrolling the violent Petare slum on the outskirts of Caracas to see officers on motorcycles in light bulletproof jackets, which offer little protection against the high-caliber bullets used by many gang members. The chaotic slum is built on a steep hill and riddled with alleys, providing many points for gang members to fire on officers or ambush them.  “You have to trust in God that you are going to make it home safe,” said the night commander Jhoni Nava, who headed the unit. “It is a tough job.”  A small command post high up in the slum showed the photo of a fallen comrade, with prayers to him written beneath. More than 330 police officers were murdered across Venezuela last year, according to counts by human rights groups.  However, human rights defenders say the police do plenty of killing of their own. The Violence Observatory estimates that officers shot dead about 3,800 people last year, which would make them one of the most homicidal forces in the world.  Antonio Gonzalez, an academic who has worked with the socialist government on police reform, agrees there is a very high rate of police killings. “Part of the problem is that many individual police officers are corrupt,” he said. “The government has made good changes to the police regulations but they often aren’t put into practice. The police force still operates in a classist way, using more violence against the poor.”  Gonzalez agrees with the opposition that there has been a breakdown of law and order in Venezuela, but blames the opposition themselves for fomenting it. In 2002, there was an attempted coup against Chavez and in 2014, thousands of opponents of the government built barricades on the streets, leading to armed confrontations.  With the government stalling on the referendum, more such confrontations could beckon, exasperating the violence further. And even if the opposition manage to vote Maduro out of power, it will take a Herculean effort to prevent more corpses piling up at the morgues of Venezuela.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON  Chiquita was facing the prospect of federal charges for paying protection money to Colombian terrorists to safeguard its banana crops, and the company needed help. It turned to Eric H. Holder Jr., an elite Washington lawyer well versed in the ways of the Justice Department.  Doug Mills/The New York Times  Eric H. Holder Jr., a well-established Washington lawyer, is Barack Obamas choice to take over at the Justice Department.  The latest on the presidential transition and other news from Washington and around the nation. Join the discussion.  “We were in an extraordinarily difficult position,” James E. Thompson, the general counsel for Chiquita, recalled in an interview last week. As a former prosecutor, Mr. Holder “carries a level of credibility with him, and that’s a valuable commodity,” he said.  Mr. Holder, now President-elect Barack Obama’s pick for attorney general, made his name publicly during a quarter-century in government service, first as a corruption prosecutor, then as a judge, and finally as the second-ranking official in the Clinton Justice Department. But it is as a power lawyer in Washington over the last eight years that Mr. Holder, 57, has made his wealth, as well as a reputation as a legal fixer for clients in crisis.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is to begin confirmation hearings on Mr. Holder on Thursday, and if he is confirmed he will take over at the Justice Department with perhaps the most extensive private practice of any attorney general in modern times. Colleagues and admirers see his impressive range of work as a sign of a lawyer who has seen the law from all sides.  But some Republicans plan to press Mr. Holder about what they view as the potential conflicts of interest posed by his client list and how he would go about deciding whether to bow out of issues that come before him involving past clients, staff members said. Others question how his corporate ties would affect his work at the Justice Department.  “We’ve had eight years of an administration that turned a blind eye to corporate criminals,” said Terry Collingsworth, a Washington lawyer who is suing Chiquita over the Colombian protection money and is facing Mr. Holder in the case. “We need someone with his level of experience and cachet to clean up the Justice Department. Yet I do have a concern and I sure hope that he doesn’t carry over his corporate defense practice into his approach to the job and how he handles these types of cases.”  When the National Football League was facing a legal and public-relations disaster in 2007 over a dogfighting scandal involving the Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, it turned to Mr. Holder to help navigate the maelstrom and represent the league. The pharmaceutical giant Merck tapped him as its lawyer in a Medicaid overbilling case that ended in a $671 million civil settlement. And Rod R. Blagojevich, the now-impeached governor of Illinois, picked him, albeit briefly, to investigate for the state a controversy over a casino development and its possible ties to organized crime.  Already, Mr. Holder’s brief association with Mr. Blagojevich has drawn scrutiny from Republicans, who are waging a more spirited campaign against Mr. Holder’s nomination than many had anticipated. Until now, most of the scrutiny has focused on controversies during the nominee’s time as deputy attorney general at the end of the Clinton administration, particularly his role in the pardon of the fugitive financier Marc Rich.  In responding to written questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder made no mention of a 2004 announcement in which Mr. Blagojevich introduced him as a “special investigator” under a $300,000 contract with the state.  The appointment fell through, and Mr. Holder’s aides said his failure to mention the episode had been an oversight that was soon corrected. But some Republicans said they were troubled by the omission. Three Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee  Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, John Cornyn of Texas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa  sent the governor’s office a Freedom of Information Act request last week seeking documents on the aborted agreement.  Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sharply questioned Mr. Holder’s character and political independence in a speech last week on the Senate floor. Mr. Specter told reporters Friday that he wanted to see more information about Mr. Holder’s private practice, to assess whether he was up to the job of attorney general.  “Covington & Burling is a very prominent, prestigious firm,” Mr. Specter said. He said Republican investigators had not yet found anything untoward in Mr. Holder’s private practice, but added, “We’re looking through all his records.”  Mr. Holder’s record in private practice has received much less attention than his earlier work at the Justice Department, particularly his role in Mr. Clinton’s 2001 pardon of Mr. Rich. Mr. Holder is being scrutinized as well over his role in other Clinton-era controversies, including clemency granted by Mr. Clinton for 16 members of a militant Puerto Rican nationalist group and the Justice Department’s refusal to appoint an independent counsel to examine possible campaign finance abuses by the White House.  With Senate Republicans challenging Mr. Holder’s nomination, a string of well-known lawyers from both parties have come to his defense with testimonials in recent days, citing both his record at the Justice Department and in private practice as evidence of his strong qualifications.  In a letter of support to the Judiciary Committee last Wednesday Louis J. Freeh, who was director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation before becoming general counsel of MBNA America Bank, told of hiring Mr. Holder as the trial counsel on a complicated case that he won for Mr. Freeh’s company.",

        "article": "âSilver Linings Playbook,â with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, is a movie accented by music.  WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — The Guild of Music Supervisors gathered here a few weeks ago for its third annual awards. And judging by the turnout, it will need a much bigger venue for next year’s event.  David O. Russell, the director who guided the use of Led Zeppelin music to enhance the bipolar character in âSilver Linings Playbook.â  Jim Croceâs âIâve Got a Nameâ was used in âDjango Unchained,\" with Jamie Foxx, left, and Christoph Waltz.  Bob Segerâs âOld Time Rock and Rollâ was used in âRisky Business,â with Tom Cruise.  Jammed into a tent atop the London hotel on a blustery evening, the affair had ballooned to three times the size of the Guild’s first ceremony, in 2011, when 150 people showed up for brunch. The event’s increasing popularity served as a reminder that these professionals often act as gatekeepers in the all-important business of placing songs in movies and television shows.  Many nonsupervisors in the room — publishers, label executives and assorted catalog holders, even Oscar-nominated songwriters — were looking to curry favor with notable music supervisors like Alexandra Patsavas (the “Twilight” movies). Others simply wanted to show solidarity with members of the three-year-old organization, many of whom feel underappreciated by a Hollywood establishment that might not understand what they do.  After all, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn’t consider their efforts Oscar-worthy. But the Guild’s president, Maureen Crowe, begs to differ. Ms. Crowe (“A Late Quartet,” “True Romance”) views her members as integral to a film as art directors or costume designers, who get their own Oscar categories.  “Music supervisors spend a lot of time thinking about character, time period, design,” she said. “Music used to be a marketing tool, but that is not the main purpose of the songs in a film. The main purpose is to serve the story, just like wardrobe and set design. If it doesn’t serve the story — if it’s forced into something — inevitably it doesn’t work.”  The Academy distributed statues last week for original score and song, but often it’s the found music that serves as the key accent to some of cinema’s most indelible moments: John Cusack’s holding aloft the boombox blasting Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” in “Say Anything”; Dustin Hoffman’s pining for Katharine Ross to Simon & Garfunkel’s “Scarborough Fair/Canticle” in “The Graduate”; Tom Cruise’s sliding across the floor in tighty-whities mouthing Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll” in “Risky Business.” These scenes express devotion, yearning and freedom in a way dialogue never could.  This awards season the highlights included the mash-up of Stevie Wonder, Jack White and Dave Brubeck for the dance sequence of “Silver Linings Playbook” and the partnership between bounty hunter and slave validated by Jim Croce’s “I’ve Got a Name” in “Django Unchained.”  The best music supervisors are sought for their combination of tastemaker, curator, producer, stickler for accuracy and verisimilitude, and they filter out a filmmaker’s worst tendencies. It’s work that falls somewhere between artisan and technician, with the kind of talent-scouting ear associated with A&R executives at record labels. “A music supervisor is set designing the audio,” said Robert Kraft, who was president of Fox Music for 18 years before forming Kraftbox Entertainment in 2012.  Mr. Kraft cited Randall Poster, whose credits include “Moonrise Kingdom” and the HBO series “Boardwalk Empire.” “He has to go out and research 1920s music,” Mr. Kraft said, referring to the HBO show. “That’s when a music supervisor is really a special talent.”  Granted, these specialists can’t take sole credit for placements of music since they’re serving the director’s vision. Filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and Cameron Crowe are very specific in their music choices. The director David O. Russell worked with Sue Jacobs on “The Fighter” and “Silver Linings Playbook,” but he had firm ideas of his own for those films, both of which used Led Zeppelin music. For “Silver Linings,” about a bipolar lead character, he wanted “What Is and What Shall Never Be,” describing it as “a perfect bipolar song because it’s very quiet and then it’s extremely loud, and it keeps going back and forth.”  That music supervisors share responsibility with the director might give the Academy pause, even though that collaborative dynamic is no different for cinematographers and production designers. It’s also not uncommon for the Oscars to reward team efforts. But tasked with keeping the telecast tight and avoiding the Grammy syndrome of too many laurels, which could dilute their importance, the Academy doesn’t exactly institute change with urgency. When animated features were added to the mix for the 74th Oscars in 2002, it was the first new category in 20 years.  Besides, music supervisors don’t exactly create anything.  For Charles Fox, chairman of the Academy’s music branch, Oscar consideration is pretty cut and dried: if it ain’t original, it ain’t eligible, period. “The key word is ‘original,’ ” he said. “In all of our categories — best song, best score — music has to be created specifically for that motion picture. If the song was written prior to that and used in the film, it’s not eligible.”  Such an argument doesn’t account for the complicated nature of the profession. “Some music supervisors are tremendously curatorial,” Mr. Kraft said. “They’re surfing the Web, they know a lot of indie bands that are up and coming, and they put together a cool soundtrack.”  Any discussion of films and music inevitably winds around to money. Most features allot 1 percent to 2 percent of production costs for all music, but would a bigger percentage (like the 10 percent Steven Van Zandt was given for the music for “Not Fade Away,” budgeted at $20 million to $25 million) provide a competitive advantage for an award? The most bang for the buck is a challenge all filmmakers face.  Mike Knobloch, the president of film music and publishing at Universal Pictures and one of the winners at the Guild’s Feb. 20 event, noted that on his studio’s box office hit about competitive a cappella, “Pitch Perfect,” the music supervisors Julianne Jordan and Julia Michels dealt with many genres that had to be stacked together and manipulated while staying within about 5 percent of the film’s $17 million production budget.  “Whether it’s from a purely creative side that involves research or intimate knowledge of a genre, being able to broker business deals or just having the vision in more complicated scenarios,” he said, the work of music supervisors is “a huge component of the movies being made. I don’t see how it isn’t as valid or worthy of recognition as all the other crafts and trades that go into making a film.”",

        "article": "Though home prices in most areas around the country remain weak, the attractiveness of purchasing a home continues to diminish in the wake of the real estate bust. Fears of price erosion, a weak economy and foreclosure dog markets coast to coast.  But not everywhere. In places like the suburbs of Rochester, N.Y., houses look like a great buy. You can get a relatively new 3,000-square-foot home on a nice quarter of an acre lot in a good school district for between $300,000 and $400,000. \"The real estate here is very inexpensive, it's about the same as renting and it actually makes sense for families,\" says Delores Conway, a real estate economics professor at the University of Rochester. \"The houses are solid investments with good school systems that are fairly priced.\"  In Pictures: The 10 Best Places To Buy A Home Right Now  One of the reasons residential real estate in Rochester is attractive is because Rochester is a college town--and homes in college towns tend to hold their value because the employment situation is more stable. The University of Rochester, a private institution that will not be impacted by the financial troubles in the public sector, is one of the biggest employers in New York State.  According to recent data put together by real estate website Zillow.com, Rochester is the best place to buy a home in the United States. One of the reasons Zillow.com rates Rochester so highly is that its foreclosure rate is a minuscule 0.24%.  In order to figure out the best places to purchase a home in the country, Zillow.com looked at four statistical measures in 125 metro areas as of the end of February. These factors included affordability, as measured by home price to income ratios; the unemployment picture (both the absolute figure and how it's trending over time); the foreclosure situation; and year-over-year housing price trends.  \"The list is populated by markets that did not participate in the housing run up from 2000 to 2006 and therefore their housing recession has been milder,\" says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.com. \"These markets are very affordable, where people are typically spending under 2.5 times their income on a house so it's pretty affordable, and they are now spending what they were paying in the 15 years between 1985 and 2000.\"  The housing recession in places like Pittsburgh was relatively mild, helping to land Pittsburgh second on the list of best places to purchase a home. Like Rochester, Pittsburgh depends on major university employers such as the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon. It also has a robust health care sector, including the UPMC and Allegheny General hospital systems. The former Steel City's median home price is an inexpensive $103,900.  Right behind Pittsburgh is Utica, N.Y, a revived industrial area where home foreclosures stand at an incredibly low 0.08%. Zillow's research has shown that bank sales negatively impact home values across a market, making ownership less profitable.",

        "article": "Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld caused a furor last week when he apparently called the French President an \"imbecil\", but he, and the editor of the magazine the comment was published in, claim he was simply misquoted.  BY Bibby Sowray | 22 October 2012  It seems Karl Lagerfeld finds himself in hot water for an inadvisable comment on a weekly basis, and last week was no different - but this time it wasn't a starlet feeling the sharp end of his tongue, but one of the world's most powerful men.  READ: Karl Lagerfeld's cat has two maids  Speaking to Spanish Marie Claire , Lagerfeld was quoted as calling French President François Hollande \"an imbecile\" , leading to much furor. The comment came as Lagerfeld addressed Hollande's controversial plan to tax those who earn more than €1million per year at 75 per cent. The designer further commented that \"Hollande hates the rich. It's a disaster. He wants to punish them, and of course, they are leaving, nobody is investing\", and also compared him to Zapatero, Spain's former Socialist Prime Minister who was ousted in December 2011.  However, the editor of Spanish Marie Claire , Joana Bonet, has since spoken out in Lagerfeld's defence, saying his comments were taken out of context. \"I confirm that the declaration (and the word 'imbécil') was taken out of context. Karl Lagerfeld was referring to Hollande's policies, especially those connected with the taxes pertaining to large fortunes,\" she told WWD over the weekend.  READ: Karl Lagerfeld's most outrageous insults  Lagerfeld also personally addressed the situation on French national television on Sunday night, saying: \"Of course I never said that! I don't speak Spanish, I speak a little of Italian but no Spanish. I saw him [Hollande] on TV and I found him very fun, spiritual and intelligent.\"",

        "article": "SEC Chair Schapiro and CFTC Chair Gensler  As I recently noted in LIBOR: The Antitrust Division’s Trojan Horse? (Street Sweeper, April 2, 2011), it appears that the Uniteds States Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division is straining under the weight of its ambitious agenda. In that article I commented that  Additionally, the present political environment is demanding pay freezes, staffing reductions, and a smaller government footprint — all of which raise questions about how the Division intends to accomplish its ambitious agenda. Taking on yet another high-profile case may be the equivalent of opening the Antitrust Division’s doors to a destructive Trojan Horse.  Frankly, it was a pretty simple inference for me to make that the rumored LIBOR investigation could break the Antitrust Division’s back. There are widespread reports of similar financial and morale problems effecting virtually all state and federal regulators and prosecutors.  This morning , Dealbook confirmed that Wall Street’s regulators are indeed feeling the strain of tightening budgets and ambitious agendas. In U.S. Regulators Face Budget Pinch as Mandates Widen (by Ben Protess, Dealbook/New York Times), we learn that  [T]he Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are struggling to fill crucial jobs, enforce new rules, upgrade market surveillance technology and pay for travel.  Their budgets may soon be even tighter, with Republicans looking to cut the regulators’ spending beginning Oct. 1, the start of the government’s fiscal year. . .  But critics contend that the agencies don’t deserve extra money, given that they missed warning signs and failed to catch serious wrongdoing in the years leading up to the crisis. The S.E.C., too, has been accused of mismanaging its finances. The Government Accountability Office has faulted the agency’s accounting almost every year since it began producing financial statements in 2004.  Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s enforcement chief, has similar worries, noting that some Wall Street investigations have faced mounting delays. Recent departures of lawyers will only magnify the problem, he added.  Mr. Khuzami also said he faced a “significant backlog” of tips and referrals, including in the area of market manipulations and accounting irregularities. The tips, which come from whistle-blowers, law enforcement agencies and investors, often prompt S.E.C. investigations.  In coming months, as Congress grapples with demands to cut taxes, cut government spending, and to stimulate the economy, it seems likely that calls from the nation’s regulators and prosecutors for more funding will fall upon less sympathetic ears. Make do with what you have, if not less, may well be the new political mantra.  All of which brings me back to my point in LIBOR: The Antitrust Division’s Trojan Horse? Given the new fiscal realities, regulators and prosecutors must first address their in-house inefficiencies and implement a responsible system of triage when deciding whether to invest time and resources into a new investigation. Similarly, as I pointed out in The Damnable Politics of Regulation, the counter-productive turf wars among and between competing regulators and prosecutors must cease.  As resumes from regulators and prosecutors flood the in-boxes of defense law firms and private sector employers, it’s obvious that many government employees are fearful about the security of their jobs. Worse, as the public sector fails to use sound management practices and simply resorts to the workplace equivalent of gavage, productivity and morale will inevitably fall.  Ultimately, defense lawyers will consider their adversary’s fatigue (or possible resignation) and demand more lop-sided settlements or call the regulator/prosecutor’s bluff by forcing more cases into contested hearings or courtrooms. The failure of the Department of Justice, the SEC, the CFTC, and other government regulators/prosecutors to better triage their caseflow and to better manage their limited budgets has consequences. The failure to timely make choices simply results in choices being forced upon you — typically for the worse.",

        "article": "Chang-rae Lee’s new novel is part folk tale, part picaresque adventure, part dystopian satire. It signals a bold departure from both the carefully observed realism that distinguished Mr. Lee’s powerful earlier books “Aloft” (2004) and “A Gesture Life” (1999) — and the historical vistas of “The Surrendered” (2010). In eschewing one of his most potent gifts as a writer — his ability to map the inner lives of his characters with sympathy and precision — Mr. Lee has produced an ungainly and strangely inert novel. Instead of creating a palpably real flesh-and-blood heroine, he has chosen to center his book on an anime-like character named Fan; and instead of creating a fully imagined fictional realm (as Kazuo Ishiguro did in his bravura sci-fi-like novel, “Never Let Me Go,” from 2005), he’s dropped Fan into a futuristic world that seems at once overly familiar and unconvincing.  For that matter, “On Such a Full Sea” often reads like a ham-handed mash-up of Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” and Suzanne Collins’s “The Hunger Games.” Both “Full Sea” and “Brave New World” take their titles from Shakespeare quotations, and both depict socially engineered worlds that have sharply delineated caste systems and embrace stability over freedom, standardization over individuality. Both “Full Sea” and “The Hunger Games” feature 16-year-old heroines who defy the established order and find themselves fighting for their lives in the wilderness of a futuristic North America.  Many of the conditions depicted in Mr. Lee’s dystopia simply represent satirical extrapolations of current or incipient woes: Climate change has made much of the world subject to extreme weather conditions; income disparities have given way to a rigid class system; and health care for lower-class workers is rationed or out of reach. The rich live in gated communities known as Charter villages; they spend their free time shopping for expensive clothes and building additions to their McMansions, and subject their children to fierce competition for academic and extracurricular honors.  Fan, we’re told, lives in a labor settlement called B-Mor (the former Baltimore), which provides fresh fish and vegetables for Charter villages; in return, B-Mor residents enjoy “estimable housing and schooling, technical training” and health care that has grown increasingly limited, thanks to recent “reforms.” Life in B-Mor, for the most part, is safe, orderly, systematized and highly controlled: In this respect, it represents a kind of communal equivalent of the careful, cautious sensibility evinced by so many of the immigrant heroes in Mr. Lee’s earlier novels, which traps them in a “gesture life,” cut off from passion and real emotional connection.  Slender and not quite five feet tall, Fan has “the stature of a girl of 11 or 12,” but is skilled at her job as a “tank diver,” charged with husbanding and nurturing the valuable fish that B-Mor raises and sells. Her boyfriend, Reg, helps plant, pollinate, prune and harvest a nearby vegetable garden. One day, Reg abruptly vanishes, perhaps whisked away by Charter doctors eager to study his rumored immunity to the dreaded C-disease that afflicts the population, and Fan, who is pregnant with his child, soon leaves B-Mor in search of him. It’s a move that shocks Fan’s neighbors and friends: The unregulated world beyond the borders of B-Mor is regarded as a dangerous wilderness, and few residents have ventured beyond its tidily groomed boundaries.  The departures of Reg and Fan soon take on a mythic status, and Banksy-like graffiti images of them start appearing on walls and fences, turning them into folk heroes, of sorts. In the wake of their disappearance, the narrator (an unnamed B-Mor resident) tells us, hints of unrest and disorder also begin to creep into the collective consciousness of the community. Fan becomes a symbol, at least to some, of daring, of a willingness to brave the unknown.  B-Mor residents’ imaginations, the narrator says, are “tethered to the universe of what we know, and as wild as our dreams might be, we can’t help but read them with the same grounded circumspection that guided our forebears when they mapped out our walls. Fan, though, made a leap, which was a startling thing in itself.”  Such windy philosophical musings lend this novel a decidedly lugubrious tone and hobble the story of Fan’s search for Reg. Plotting has not been Mr. Lee’s strong suit in novels like “Native Speaker” (1995) and “Aloft,” and here, Fan’s adventures devolve into a string of bizarre encounters with assorted weirdos and mercenaries, including a former veterinarian turned physician, known as Quig, who has traded and bartered away patients and their relatives; a murderous roving family of acrobats; and a wealthy Charter woman called Miss Cathy, who wants to add Fan to her collection of girls, whom she keeps as a well-groomed menagerie of pet humans.  These encounters have no cumulative power and often feel like random episodes improvised on the fly to lend suspense to Fan’s story. And because Fan remains more of a symbol than a fully fashioned character, we have a hard time caring what happens to her, one way or the other.  In “The Surrendered,” Mr. Lee moved beyond the domestic realism of his earlier books to create an ambitious, symphonic novel that addressed the emotional fallout of the Korean War. Here, he has again tried to push his talents in a daring new direction, but this time, the result, sadly, is an unsatisfying and jerry-built fairy tale.  ON SUCH A FULL SEA  352 pages.

(Lucasfilm)  Ralph McQuarrie's sketches of Imperial Stormtroopers. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)  “Star Wars” is a persistent (and even relentless) presence in pop culture today, but in 1974 the Empire existed only in the imagination and writing of George Lucas. To get the expensive intergalactic project off the ground, though, the filmmaker knew he would need more proof of his vision — that’s when he hired artist Ralph McQuarrie to paint vivid dispatches from this far-away galaxy and its alien landscapes, strange warriors and memorable machines.  The collaboration bottled-up a rare sort of lightning and the echo of its thunder grew louder with the news that McQuarrie, 82, died Saturday after a battle with Parkinson’s disease. The passing put his legacy — both as a Jedi myth-pioneer and a titan of concept art –very much on the mind of illustrators, filmmakers and fans.  “You know what it’s like? It’s like George Martin and the Beatles,” said fantasy artist Tony DiTerlizzi, referring to the Fab Four and the studio producer who helped make the group the creative engine they became. “You kind of needed both of them.”  McQuarrie had fought in Korea, illustrated catalogs, and found success as a technical artist for Boeing by the time Lucas, a generation younger, asked him to paint scenes he could take to the studio to persuade them to fund “Star Wars.” After seeing McQuarrie’s paintings, Fox executives gave Lucas the green light for the film.  It was the beginning of a beautiful collaboration between the mastermind behind the space adventure films that would become a worldwide phenomenon and the artist who possessed the ability to find that world first and then paint it. McQuarrie sketched characters for Lucas, including C-3PO, R2-D2, the Stormtroopers, and even providing the mask that would become the defining characteristic of Darth Vader. Lucas referred to McQuarrie’s art as he made the original trilogy, using it as a blueprint on set.  A Ralph McQuarrie sketch shows Darth Vader leaping. (Lucasfilm)  “When words could not convey my ideas, I could always point to one of Ralph’s fabulous illustrations and say, ‘Do it like this,’ ” Lucas said a in statement.  McQuarrie never expected his paintings to find an audience beyond Lucas and his crew, said John Scoleri, who coauthored a book about McQuarrie’s art, but “Star Wars” fans fell in love with his art, and it found its way to posters, action figures and lunch boxes.  “So many people feel that Ralph’s work was the pulse of ‘Star Wars,’ ” Scoleri said. “He created from scratch what so many people since then have kind of taken for granted.”  McQuarrie became known among fans as the “first person to experience the world that George had had in his head,” said John Singh, an entertainment publicist who spent six years working at Lucasfilm.  “Ralph McQuarrie got to the heart and soul of what ‘Star Wars’ was,” Singh said. “The images that he created were so vibrant and filled with color and history. They weren’t story boards. They weren’t comics. They were art.”  His work with Lucas opened doors for McQuarrie across the film industry, creating concept art for the likes of Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard. He won an Oscar for his work on “Cocoon,” and he worked on “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and even drew the now-famous illustration in the Bible that Indiana Jones opens in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” But through all of it, it was “Star Wars” that remained closest to his heart.  “It gave him a chance to do something where he felt like he was in his element,” Scoleri said. “He was really doing that which he was born to do.”  McQuarrie also began illustrating book covers for Del Rey Books, the science-fiction and fantasy publisher home to the “Star Wars” novels as well as the likes of Philip K. Dick, Anne McCaffrey and Arthur C. Clarke. Michael Whelan, another Del Rey artist and perhaps the most popular fantasy illustrator alive, said McQuarrie’s work stood out because “it didn’t look cobbled together from his environment.”  “He brought a level of cinematic realism to science-fiction art,” Whelan said. “It didn’t look, as science-fiction illustration so often does, like things that exist in our world that have been slightly modified and placed in a phony environment, almost like something that was cut out and glued into an environment that already exists. Everything in the environment looked of-a-piece and fresh and made from the same cloth, so to speak. There’s a sense of ambient completeness to all his work. That seamless integration of fantasy and realism is something that really set his work apart from other people working in the field.”  McQuarrie illustrated two collections of Isaac Asimov’s short stories, “Robot Dreams” and “Robot Visions.” In his introduction to “Robot Dreams,” Asimov wrote that the cover illustration, which “humanizes a robot in a way I have never seen before,” inspired a story in the collection.  “For Isaac Asimov to compliment you on doing something involving robots, it’s one of those pinnacles that you just can’t quite top,” Scoleri said.  Despite his success, McQuarrie is best remembered by his peers as a humble man.  “He really was such a humble, self-effacing guy,” said Stephen Sansweet, former director of content management and fan relations adviser at Lucasfilm. Sansweet remembers being surprised by McQuarrie’s gentle, down-to-earth personality when they met for the first time in 1991. “Here in my eyes, and in the eyes of so many other Star Wars fans and artists who were inspired by him, he was this icon, this god, but he turns out to be this humble, ‘Oh yeah, well, you know, George hired me, and I did my best. It’s really cool to see some of my stuff out there.’”  Lucas praised his patience and humility, and Scoleri described him as “shy and private.”  “He seemed rather humble and not really fully aware of the impact that his work was going to have on the look of science fiction from his time onwards,” Whelan said.  And what an impact it had. McQuarrie’s work paved the way for concept art as a career, inspired hundreds of young artists across film and print illustration fields, and continued to shape the “Star Wars” universe; the concept artists behind the “Star Wars” prequels based many designs on unused McQuarrie work from the first three films, as does “The Clone Wars” — the animated TV series, Sansweet said.  “He changed everything,” Whelan said. “In both his print illustrations and his movie work, there isn’t an artist I know working in the field who hasn’t studied his work minutely to glean whatever gold could be taken from the treasure trove of his work — the composition, the color, the sheer imaginativeness of his creations, the sense of realism to the sense of lighting and the form of the mechanical objects that he rendered — all of it all comes together in his work, and I think it held influence over everything that came afterwards. His influence can’t be overestimated, in my opinion.”  After several years of gathering McQuarrie’s art and stories, Scoleri visited McQuarrie and his wife at their Berkeley home in 2007 to show him the finished product: a limited-edition book featuring his work.  Scoleri remembers McQuarrie sitting in his dining room, flipping through the pages of his paintings and sketches.  “You know,” McQuarrie said, a smile forming on his face, “some of this isn’t too bad.”  Ralph McQuarrie’s long-lost ‘Star Wars’ art  Lightsaber swordsman Bob Anderson is dead  Star Wars: The Old Republic: A galactic gamble?  ‘Dawn of the Jedi’ creators wrestle with the Force  ‘Spiderwick’ illustrator draws on the Force  Kurtz: Toy sales took Lucas to dark side  Did Lucas change cinema with prequel trilogy?  ‘Star Wars’: A look back to May 1977  Anthony Daniels on C-3PO’s role in new ride",

        "article": "Jeff Bezos (from left), Mark Zuckerberg and Marissa Mayer. Do they have what it takes to be the next Steve Jobs?  (CNN) -- It's a loaded question, one with no clear answer. But in the year since Apple's co-founder and visionary CEO died, it's been asked in tech circles over and over:  Who is the next Steve Jobs?  There's one easy response. It's safe to say that no figure in the tech industry will perfectly duplicate the unique blend of vision, salesmanship, mystique and eye for detail possessed by Jobs, who died one year ago Friday.  And it's complicated further, some say, by the fact that for much of his own life, many wouldn't have predicted Jobs himself would earn tech-icon status.  \"Steve Jobs had a strange career. He really wasn't celebrated as a genius until really late,\" said Leander Kahney, editor of the Cult of Mac blog and author of books on Apple, including \"Inside Steve's Brain.\"  Not until Jobs returned to Apple and introduced the iPod and iPhone did people begin to praise him as a modern-day Thomas Edison, Kahney said. \"He was dismissed before then as a marketing guy, a fast talker who didn't know much about technology. He only really was lionized in the last four or five years.\"  #WhatSteveJobsTaughtMe: Share your thoughts on his life and career  But industry observers abhor a vacuum. Futile though it might be, it's perhaps human nature to speculate about who could emerge to fill the void left by the passing of tech's biggest personality and most recognizable face.  One can make cases for or against a handful of nominees. And no list is long enough to include an as-yet unknown creator who may be birthing the industry's next game-changer in a garage or dorm room somewhere.  Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs?  But here are some names worth considering, with thoughts both for and against their candidacies:  Pros: Bezos actually has a host of traits that mirror Jobs. Like Jobs was with Apple, he's the founder of Amazon as well as its CEO. Being a part of a company's life story helps. As much as anyone, Bezos also captures a bit of Jobs' panache at live events. At last year's rollout of the Kindle Fire, he got high marks for introducing a game-changing product in a stylized fashion, then getting off the stage. (Tech giants Google and Microsoft have been accused of being rambling and unfocused at similar unveilings.) Reports say Bezos shares Jobs' penchant for attention to detail (some would say micromanaging) and, like Jobs, he's been willing to take the company into new and unexpected directions.  \"I've met Bezos personally, and he is mesmeric. Brilliant smile, quick mind, very engaging and decisive,\" Kahney told CNN. \"He has the same obsession with the ordinary consumer; to make and sell things from the consumer's point of view. ... Bezos has Jobs' focus and drive. He's a little bit maniacal in his drive and ambition.\"  Cons: Despite the Kindle line, Amazon is, at its core, a content company. The mobile devices are a means of delivering books, music, movies and other data to customers as directly as possible. Will the public ever be as excited about the CEO of the company that peddles e-books and data-storage space as it was about the one that sold it its personal computers, laptops, phones and music players?  Pros: The Steves -- Jobs and Wozniak -- had their garage. Zuckerberg had his Harvard dorm room. And in those two rooms, perhaps the two best-known origin stories in tech were born. As head of the social network that has changed the way people use the Internet, Zuckerberg is maybe the only tech boss who, like Jobs, has become a household name. (\"The Social Network\" didn't hurt.) He created a product that millions of people now use. And he's even cultivated his own trademark, casual-wear style, as the Zuckerberg hoodie is now almost as iconic as Jobs' mock turtleneck.  \"Zuckerberg has some of the characteristics (of Jobs), and perhaps the most important one -- the pursuit of a vision,\" Kahney said. \"That sets him apart.\"  Cons: He's gotten better at speaking in public. But as a pitchman, Zuckerberg still falls miles short of the charismatic Jobs. It's seems Zuck would rather be the idea man behind the scenes than front-and-center when it comes time to sell the final product. Also, the fact that Facebook's stock price is not already racing toward Google/Apple heights doesn't help.  Apple's Tim Cook has inherited Steve Jobs' role as chief Apple pitchman.  Pros: Well, there's the obvious one. Job's was Apple's CEO. Now Cook is. At the helm of the company, Cook gets to be the face of every new innovation rolled out by Apple. He's got the biggest stage and brightest spotlight in which to put himself forward.  Cons: Cook comes from more of a business background than one of innovation and design. He may masterfully steer Apple's course for years to come, but, rightly or not, few observers at this juncture are inclined to give him credit for vision, or influence over products' design, the way they did Jobs. Plus, being Apple CEO after Jobs is like being the football coach who follows a retiring Bear Bryant or Vince Lombardi. What were those guys' names? Exactly.  Apple design chief Jonathan Ive chats with Kate Middleton at an event in London on July 30.  Jonathan Ive, senior vice president, Apple  Pros: When Jobs stepped down, there were many who expected Ive, not Cook, to step up. Ive is senior vice president of industrial design and is believed to be the creative mind behind products from the Macbook Pro to the iPod to the iPad. The London native already has a knighthood, as well as a healthy dose of Jobs' true-believer passion for the product.  Cons: Well, he's not the CEO. (Nor is marketing mastermind Phil Schiller, another name bandied about to replace Jobs). To truly ascend to Jobsian levels, Ive would need to set out on his own -- which, at 45, is doable. It's hard to envision Ive bolting from Apple, where he's worked since 1992. But, boy, it would be fun to watch.  Pros: If you need proof of how well Google alum Mayer is liked in Silicon Valley, just look at the number of folks she's been able to lure to join her at a Yahoo that was floundering when she took the reins in July. At Google, where the former engineer was the 20th employee, she's credited with everything from the clean design of the search page to becoming one of the leading public faces of the tech giant.  Cons: It looks like a turnaround has begun at Yahoo. But the job's still a long way from done. If Mayer becomes the face of a dramatic rebirth, she will have accomplished something few predicted. If she doesn't (the four CEOs before her all fell short), it likely won't hurt her reputation all that much -- but neither will it bump her up to the next level.  Elon Musk hopes to revolutionize several industries.  Pros: How's this for an origin story? Musk grew up in South Africa before leaving home at 17, without his parents' consent, rather than serve a compulsory stint in an army which, at the time, was enforcing the race-based apartheid system. He'd end up in the United States four years later -- although he'd already sold his first software, a video game called Blastar, when he was 12. Since then, all he's done is create publishing software Zip2 (sold to AltaVista for $300 million), co-found PayPal (he owned 11% of its stock when eBay bought it for $1.5 billion) and help create Tesla Motors, makers of the first commercial electric car. Oh, wait ... he also runs SpaceX, a company working on space exploration. Director Jon Favreau says Musk was his inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark character in the \"Iron Man\" movies.  \"His ambitions are so huge,\" Kahney said. \"He's definitely a ballsy character. And he's a good leader, like Jobs. He's surrounded himself with good people.\"  Cons: With the exception of Tesla, none of Musk's projects, so far, have directly involved consumer products. Tens of millions of people had something Jobs made in their pockets, on their desks or piping music into their ears. Among the public, Musk may be less well-known than all of the names above -- at least for now. But, at 41, he's got time to change that and it would be foolish to bet against him.  Seth Priebatsch, CEO, SCVNGR, LevelUp  Pros: Who? Priebatsch is the wild card on this list. But consider him the representative of a new generation of young, creative tech \"makers\" who could ascend to loftier heights in the years, or decades, to come. At 22, Priebatsch's SCVNGR raised more than $20 million in funding. He founded his first Web company at 12 and has moved on to start LevelUp, a mobile-payments system that's also raked in millions from investors. He got rock-star treatment for a speech he gave last year at South by Southwest Interactive. Plus, he's already cultivated a Jobs-like signature fashion statement -- his trademark orange sunglasses and shirts.  Cons: In the startup world, for every success story, there are countless washouts. Not every young turk even wants to be another Jobs, and not every killer app has the potential to make millions, or billions, of dollars -- even when they're well-liked and widely used.

It will also triple its purchases of ETFs to 3 trillion yen from 1 trillion yen and Japan real estate investment trusts to 90 billion from 30 billion.  In its policy statement, the central bank pledged to maintain easing as long as necessary to achieve stable 2 percent inflation.  \"The key part of this announcement is they are trying to drive all doubt out of the market about the level of commitment to achieving the desired goal,\" said Ed Rogers, chief executive officer of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors.  Read MoreWal-Mart to close 30 underperforming stores in Japan  Data released earlier Friday showed consumer inflation slowing further in September. Adjusted for the April tax hike, core consumer prices rose 1 percent on year, slower than the 1.1 percent rise in August and well below the 2 percent target the central bank aims to achieve by mid-2015.  Today's action proves that Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is going to do whatever it takes to create the environment needed for success, Rogers added.  Will the BOJ's second bazooka work?  In its twice-annual economic outlook report released shortly after the monetary policy decision, the BoJ lowered its real gross domestic product (GDP) growth target to 0.5 percent for financial year ending March 2015, from a 1.0 percent projection in July.  Core CPI projections excluding the effects of the sales tax hike were also lowered to 1.2 percent for financial year 2014/2015 from an earlier target of 1.3 percent, and to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent for financial year 2015/2016.  Japan watchers are hopeful the fresh stimulus will put the economy on a more stable footing.  Read MoreIs South Korea headed for Japan-style deflation?  The BoJ's accommodative stance will be positive for stocks, which will help create a wealth effect and boost consumption, said economists.  It will also add fuel to dollar-yen trade – weakening the yen – which is positive for Japan's export sector, they said.  The U.S. dollar rose more than 2 percent against the yen on Friday to an intraday high around 111, its highest level since 2008.  \"Companies have been reluctant to increase production as they weren't sure if the weak yen was here to stay. This will improve the environment for companies to invest,\" said Martin Schulz, senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute.  With the BoJ giving the economy a fresh shot in the arm, this increases the likelihood that the government will follow through with a second tax hike - to 10 percent from 8 percent - next year, say economists.  \"The government can make a case because the BoJ is being more expansionary,\" said Schulz.

        "article": "As the Obama administration cheered “the worker wins” from a newly announced expansion of overtime pay, the directive drew a fierce backlash Wednesday from Republicans and the business community -- amid warnings that the move could backfire and hurt workers in the end.  “These rules are a career killer. With the stroke of a pen, the Labor Department is demoting millions of workers,” David French, a senior vice president for the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Wednesday morning.  Policy changes formally unveiled Wednesday would make more than 4 million U.S. workers newly eligible for overtime pay. They’re intended to counter erosion in overtime protections, which require employers to pay 1 1/2 times a worker's regular salary for any work past 40 hours a week.  In the fast food and retail industries in particular, many workers have missed out on this because they’re deemed “managers” – they work long hours but are paid little more than the people they supervise.  Under the new rules, first released in draft form last summer, the annual salary threshold at which companies can deny overtime pay will be doubled from $23,660 to nearly $47,500.  That means a fast-food manager making $14 an hour – or roughly $30,000 a year – would now be eligible for overtime for those extra hours.  The White House estimates the rule change will raise pay by $1.2 billion a year over the next decade. In addition, some companies may instead choose to reduce their employees' hours to avoid paying the extra wages.  \"Either way, the worker wins,\" said Vice President Joe Biden on a conference call with reporters Tuesday afternoon. He formally announced the rules at an event in Ohio Wednesday afternoon.  But critics warn workers could actually lose out as employers try to avoid the extra costs by converting salaried workers to hourly ones in order to more closely track working time, and cutting back in general.  Business groups say the changes will increase paperwork and scheduling burdens for small companies. The NRF’s David French said hundreds of thousands of workers in the retail sector alone will lose salaried-employee status.  “These regulations are full of false promises. Most of the people impacted by this change will not see any additional pay. Instead, this sudden and extraordinary increase will mean more red tape and fewer advancement opportunities for salaried professionals,” he said.  Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate labor committee, also said the final overtime rule would have the effect of raising tuition at one local Tennessee college. He said he’ll introduce a resolution to try and block the rule and “protect Tennessee colleges and businesses from its harmful effects.”  Sam Batkins, a regulatory policy expert at the conservative-minded American Action Forum, told FoxNews.com earlier this week the directive is one of the “costliest rules of the year” and estimated a $2 billion price tag.  The Chamber of Commerce has also warned the rules “will be trouble for employers.”  The overtime threshold was last updated in 2004 and now covers just 7 percent of full-time, salaried workers, administration officials said. That's down from 62 percent in 1975.  The higher threshold, which will take effect Dec. 1, will lift that ratio back to 35 percent, Labor Secretary Tom Perez said. Perez has spearheaded the administration's effort and worked on formulating the rule for the past two years.  The new rule is intended to boost earnings for middle- and lower-income workers, Perez said, which have been stagnant since the late 1990s. Overtime pay hasn't gotten as much attention as nationwide efforts to increase the minimum wage, but it could have a broad impact.  \"This in essence is a minimum wage increase for the middle class,\" Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group, said.  Overtime has become a sore point for many managers, assistant managers, and management trainees in the fast food and retail industries.  Despite their titles, they have complained in lawsuits against chains such as Chipotle and Dollar General that they spend the vast majority of 50- or 60-hour weeks working cash registers, mopping floors, or performing other tasks typical of regular employees. Yet they don't get paid time and a half when they clock more than 40 hours in a week.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "article": "MORE than 1,000 mourners were expected to file into the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on St. John Street in Lafayette, La., this morning to pay final tribute to Eraste Thomas Autin, 18, a local high school football hero who died Wednesday.  It was six days after he had collapsed in 102-degree heat following a voluntary freshman workout at the University of Florida — voluntary, that is, under the N.C.A.A. rules, for official workouts are not supposed to begin for another two weeks. He had been in a coma since July 19.  Autin, heavily recruited out of St. Thomas More High School, had accepted a football scholarship to Florida. He planned to major in pre-med and follow in the footsteps of his father, Dr. David Autin. Eraste Autin had been a good student in high school, but he was also a talented athlete. At 6-foot-2, 250 pounds, he played fullback and, it was said, had a shot at starting at that position for the Gators.  Autin's was the second college football-related death in the state in the last five months. In February, Devaughn Darling, a Florida State linebacker, also collapsed and died after a so-called voluntary workout during the off- season. He was, like Autin, 18 years old and a freshman.  The coroner's report on Autin stated that he died from complications of heatstroke. An autopsy on Darling, who died after arduous indoor agility drills, found no definitive cause, although the autopsy also reported that a rare sickle-cell trait may have played a role.  Nonetheless, Autin is the 18th high school or college football player since 1995 to die from heatstroke. Dr. Fred Mueller of the University of North Carolina's sports medicine department tracks these statistics.  \"It shouldn't be,\" he said, regarding the number of football deaths by heatstroke. \"There has to be more done to prevent these tragedies, and there can be. I think most are preventable.\"  Mueller said that such deaths reached a high of eight in one year, in 1970, and then began to decrease. \"For a number of years, there were no deaths at all,\" he said, \"but in the last seven years they've begun to creep back up again.\"  Checking players' weight after practice and the following day to monitor excessive weight loss, and taking mandatory rest breaks in the shade and water breaks during practice and at needed intervals, he said, are essential to help prevent heatstroke. \"Many kids don't want to do this,\" he added, \"so someone has got to be watching.\"  Mueller also wondered what voluntary really meant.  \"I teach a class with football players,\" he said, \"and there's a concern about voluntary practice: if you don't show up, it hardly helps your chances of making the football team, or playing more.\"  Jeremy Foley, the Florida athletic director, seemed to agree.  \"It's a two-edged sword,\" he said. \"You want to get players in shape for the official workouts. On the other hand, you don't want to overwork them, but no matter what you do, many of them are so highly motivated — and concerned for their spot on the team — that they'll work out on their own if they have to.\"  Foley said, yes, there were rest breaks, that water was plentiful and available, and that six coaches were on the field at all times. \"Eraste was a hard-working, dedicated kid who was in excellent physical shape,\" Foley said. \"He didn't stumble around on the field. He showed no visible signs of distress.\"  Autin's death may or may not be one of the mysteries of life. His mother, Joanie, said there was no reason to believe there was danger, since Eraste had practiced in the heat of Louisiana summers throughout his junior high school and high school years. \"He was never sick,\" she said.  In Mueller's view, however, the overall reason for the rise in deaths of high school and college football players due to heatstroke can be guessed.  \"Proper precautions,\" he said, \"have apparently been relaxed.\"  The pressures of football, the macho element in football, surely seem to contribute to relaxing such precautions.  An added suggestion here is that twice a year, the team doctor on every high school and college team read to his players and coaches and school administrators the names of the football dead in recent years, and describe the circumstances. Maybe also run a film of Eraste Autin's funeral.  Morbid? Possibly. But lifesaving, possibly, too.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Oil from the BP spill remains stuck on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, according to a top scientist's video and slides that she says demonstrate the oil isn't degrading as hoped and has decimated life on parts of the seafloor.  By Samatha Joye, University of Georgia via AP  Oil residue coats a dead crab on Dec. 1 on a still-damaged seafloor about 10 miles north of the BP rig accident.  By Samatha Joye, University of Georgia via AP  Oil residue coats a dead crab on Dec. 1 on a still-damaged seafloor about 10 miles north of the BP rig accident.  That report is at odds with a recent report by the BP spill compensation czar that said nearly all will be well by 2012.  At a science conference in Washington, marine scientist Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia aired early results of her December submarine dives around the BP spill site. She went to places she had visited in the summer and expected the oil and residue from oil-munching microbes would be gone by then. It wasn't.  \"There's some sort of a bottleneck we have yet to identify for why this stuff doesn't seem to be degrading,\" Joye told the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Washington. Her research and those of her colleagues contrasts with other studies that show a more optimistic outlook about the health of the Gulf, saying microbes did great work munching the oil.  \"Magic microbes consumed maybe 10% of the total discharge, the rest of it we don't know,\" Joye said. \"There's a lot of it out there,\" she later added.  The head of the agency in charge of the health of the Gulf said Saturday that she thought that \"most of the oil is gone.\" And a Department of Energy scientist, doing research with a grant from BP from before the spill, said his examination of oil plumes in the water column show that microbes have done a \"fairly fast\" job of eating the oil. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab scientist Terry Hazen said his research differs from Joye's because they looked at different places at different times.  Joye's research was more widespread, but has been slower in being published in scientific literature.  In five different expeditions, the last one in December, Joye and colleagues took 250 cores of the seafloor and traveled across 2,600 square miles. Some of the locations she had been studying before the oil spill on April 20 and said there was a noticeable change. Much of the oil she found on the sea floor — and in the water column — was chemically fingerprinted, proving it comes from the BP spill. Joye is still waiting for results to show other oil samples she tested are from BP's Macondo well.  She also showed pictures of oil-choked bottom-dwelling creatures. They included dead crabs and brittle stars — starfish like critters that are normally bright orange and tightly wrapped around coral. These brittle stars were pale, loose and dead. She also saw tube worms so full of oil they suffocated.  \"This is Macondo oil on the bottom,\" Joye said as she showed slides. \"This is dead organisms because of oil being deposited on their heads.\"  Joye said her research shows that the burning of oil left soot on the seafloor, which still had petroleum products. And even more troublesome was the tremendous amount of methane from the BP well that mixed into the Gulf and was mostly ignored by other researchers.  Joye and three colleagues last week published a study in Nature Geoscience that said the amount of gas injected into the Gulf was the equivalent of between 1.5 and 3 million barrels of oil.  \"The gas is an important part of understanding what happened,\" said Ian MacDonald of Florida State University.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco told reporters Saturday that \"it's not a contradiction to say that although most of the oil is gone, there still remains oil out there.\"  Earlier this month, Kenneth Feinberg, the government's oil compensation fund czar, said based on research he commissioned he figured the Gulf of Mexico would almost fully recover by 2012 — something Joye and Lubchenco said isn't right.  \"I've been to the bottom. I've seen what it looks like with my own eyes. It's not going to be fine by 2012,\" Joye told the Associated Press. \"You see what the bottom looks like, you have a different opinion.\"  NOAA chief Lubchenco said \"even though the oil degraded relatively rapidly and is now mostly but not all gone, damage done to a variety of species may not become obvious for years to come.\"  On Saturday, Lubchenco also announced the start of a Gulf restoration planning process to get the Gulf back to the condition it was on Apr. 19, the day before the spill. That program would eventually be paid for BP and other parties deemed responsible for the spill. This would be separate from an already begun restoration program that would improve all aspects of the Gulf, not just the oil spill, but has not been funded by the government yet, she said.  The new program, which is part of the Natural Resources Damage Assessment program, is part of the oil spill litigation — or out-of-court settlement — in which the polluters pay for overall damage to the ecosystem and efforts to return it to normal. This is different than paying compensation to people and businesses directly damaged by the spill.  The process will begin with public meetings all over the region.

Reports indicate Apple will release the watch in an array of casings and straps and allow buyers to customize the look to some extent. The priciest model—a gold Apple Watch—is expected to run as much as $10,000.  That decision shows the difference between the cultures of Apple and Samsung, said Ken Segall, a former creative director at Apple who worked with Steve Jobs for 12 years.  While Samsung came out with its Galaxy Gear watch first, it released a standard, one-size-fits all version, he told \"Squawk on the Street.\" Apple studied the market and decided to launch a greater variety of devices, he added.  \"I think it's the beginning of really mainstream wearable technology. We've seen a lot of things out there, but nobody has the ability to do what Apple does, to really come up with a world-changing device,\" he said.  Read More Poll: Which feature is most important for you on the Apple Watch?  Apple still faces significant challenges, McCourt said, noting that with revenues running close to $200 billion it will be tough for the Apple Watch to move the needles on the company's overall earnings.  \"The watch market today is $30 billion or so, so they've got to not only take some share but actually grow that market,\" he said. \"They've done that in smartphones and tablets before.\"  About 10 percent of iPhone users—or roughly 30 million people—have serious interest in buying an Apple Watch, according to a Raymond James survey. For every 10 million watches sold, depending on the price, the watch could add 25 to 40 cents to Apple's earnings per share on an annual basis, according to McCourt.",

        "article": "LONDON — IF you think Donald J. Trump’s early lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination is the season’s most spectacular case of unlikely political ascendancy, think again. In Britain, a 66-year-old left-wing member of Parliament named Jeremy Corbyn is close to becoming the leader of the Labour Party.  If he prevails, he will most likely be its candidate for prime minister in 2020. The leadership vacancy followed the resignation of Ed Miliband after Labour’s dismal showing in the May election, which enabled David Cameron’s Conservative Party to form a government.  Mr. Corbyn, who has been in the House of Commons since 1983, is an old-fashioned, unapologetic socialist. Compared to Senator Bernie Sanders, he is, in many respects, even more radical. Imagine if a figure like Noam Chomsky or Michael Moore were in Congress and became the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the White House.  Mild-mannered in person, Mr. Corbyn is demagogic on a podium. Though his party has made accommodations with globalization, consumerism, individualism and the decline of labor as a political force, he has represented a fixed point of anticapitalist ideology for decades.  He opposes austerity cuts and would raise taxes sharply. He idolized the Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chávez (who died in 2013), and has described as friends officials from Hezbollah and Hamas, Islamist movements that the United States government considers terrorist organizations. And he believes in unilateral nuclear disarmament for Britain.  Yet, far from being considered the retro candidate in the leadership contest, Mr. Corbyn has emerged as favorite. He is the leading choice of local party branches and is backed by the trade union Unite, which is the party’s most important donor. Opinion surveys suggest that Mr. Corbyn is on course to win against his more moderate or centrist rivals: Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall.  Whatever happens, he will be a force in the movement, a maverick transformed into a party baron.  Mr. Corbyn’s rise has caused some consternation. The former prime minister Tony Blair, who led Labour to three successive election victories by jettisoning precisely what Mr. Corbyn stands for, has warned the party against a regression to left-wing purism. To those who say that their heart tells them to vote for Mr. Corbyn, Mr. Blair said, “Get a transplant.”  Mr. Blair’s analysis is hard to refute, but so far the party is deaf to his entreaties. Ms. Kendall, the only candidate who shares Mr. Blair’s perspective, is running fourth. Ms. Cooper and Mr. Burnham are both capable politicians, but neither communicates a sense of urgency or passion.  To win the 2020 election, which will follow redistricting, the Labour Party would need an additional 106 seats in the House of Commons. To achieve this, it must woo Conservative voters.  In Scotland, the dynamic is different. Labour must try to take seats from the left-wing Scottish Nationalist Party. But at present, there are only 59 constituencies in Scotland, so a Labour strategy based on competing with the S.N.P. will fail if applied across the rest of Britain.  This points to the heart of the problem. With the exception of Ms. Kendall, none of the candidates would follow a Blairite template for winning back moderate Conservatives. Although Mr. Miliband, who earned the nickname “Red Ed,” already tested to destruction the theory that Britons had shifted leftward, the left is overweening, contemptuous of the “Blairite comfort blanket” — the idea that tacking back toward the center would make Labour more electable.  In practice, there’s nothing comforting in Mr. Blair’s message. He’s asking a progressive party to confront the bleak reality that millions of decent people are fearful that voting Labour in 2020 would be an act of self-harm.  When I hear Mr. Corbyn speak — and he speaks very well — I recall a story from Mr. Blair’s great ally Peter Mandelson. He recalled being told by a far-left colleague during Labour’s long years of opposition, from 1979 to 1997, that there must be “no compromise with the electorate.”  Why won’t the party compromise?  After 1989, the British left no longer felt contaminated by Soviet totalitarianism. And since the 2008 financial crash, the old-fashioned socialists within Labour have mistaken public anger against banks as evidence that the hour of anticapitalist true believers had come. Critics have also used Mr. Blair’s errors over intervening in Iraq to besmirch his overall achievement. So it is the left that has found an unwarranted confidence this summer.  The party’s registered voters have until Sept. 10 to avoid a fatal error. It is Mr. Corbyn who offers a comfort blanket, inviting his supporters to wrap themselves in the illusory warmth of ideological nostalgia that will, in reality, consign Labour to chilly irrelevance.  Matthew d’Ancona, a poli­tical columnist for The Guardian and The Evening Standard, is a contributing opinion writer.

(Instagram)  A young woman who lost her leg after a battle with bone cancer, has set her sights on stamping out beauty norms and expectations.  Jess Quinn, 23, lost her right leg when she was just nine years old.  “Growing up and not being able to do the things I wanted, it got me down. I’ve had to find new ways of doing things,” Ms Quinn told the Daily Mail.  Ms Quinn, who is now preparing for a 10km race at the end of the year, said getting used to prosthesis was overwhelming.  “It was hard getting used to the prosthetic, I had expected to jump on it and be sweet. I didn’t realise the amount of work going into it, it was quite shocking.  “I'm still trying to figure it out now; it's one of those ongoing things.”  Having never run more than 600 metres, Ms Quinn is now undergoing intense training with her new blade runners in her quest to conquer the 10km race – challenging herself to “go big or go home”.  “I've always been really into health and fitness, even as a kid. After the surgery I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to run again.”  Ms Quinn now counts herself as a social media influencer, with more than 55,000 Instagram followers who throw their support behind her every step of the way.  “I've never considered my cancer story any different but I am starting to realise how my outlook on life can help, people thrive on the real stories.  “I want to reach out, not just people with disabilities but also anyone living with insecurities.  “That's my goal, to help everyone from young and old to male or female. I don't want to put myself in a category.”",

        "article": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates has broken with other Silicon Valley giants by backing the FBI in its battle with Apple over hacking into a locked iPhone as part of the investigation into last December's San Bernardino terror attack.  In an interview with the Financial Times published Tuesday, Gates said a court order requiring Apple to help the FBI access a work phone belonging to gunman Syed Farook was \" a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case.\"  Gates went on to compare the FBI's request to accessing bank and telephone records. However, he added that the government must be subject to rules about when it can access such information.  \"I hope that we have that debate so that the safeguards are built and so people do not opt — and this will be country by country — [to say] it is better that the government does not have access to any information,\" Gates said.  The San Bernardino County-issued iPhone 5C was used by Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at an office holiday party in December before they died in a gun battle with police. The government said they had been at least partly inspired by ISIS.  The couple physically destroyed two personal phones so completely that the FBI has been unable to recover information from them.  Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that creating such software is a dangerous precedent that would threaten data security for millions by making essentially a master key that could later be duplicated and used against other phones. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday expressed his support for Apple while in Barcelona, Spain, to speak at the Mobile World Congress, saying he believes in helping the government in its fight against terrorism but that encryption is important.  \"I don't think that back doors into encryption is going to increase security or is in the direction the world is going,\" he said.  Twitter boss Jack Dorsey also tweeted his support last week for Cook's \"leadership\", while Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the order for Apple to hack the phone \"could be a troubling precedent.\"  Meanwhile, family members of attack victims and survivors intend to file court papers in support of the original order by a federal magistrate.  The victims \"have questions that go simply beyond the criminal investigation ... in terms of why this happened, how this happened, why they were targeted, is there anything about them on the iPhone -- things that are more of a personal victim\" view, attorney Stephen Larson said, adding that the brief would be filed before March 3.  Robert Velasco, whose 27-year-old daughter Yvette Velasco was killed in the shooting, told The Associated Press that he didn't have to think long before agreeing to have his name added to the legal filing in support of the FBI.  \"It is important to me to have my name in there,\" Velasco said. \"I lost my daughter in this and I want the court to see that I am seeking justice for my daughter.\"  Gregory Clayborn, whose 27-year-old daughter, Sierra, died in the attack, said he hasn't been asked to join the case but believes Apple is obligated to unlock the phone.  \"This makes me a little bit angry with Apple,\" Clayborn said. \"It makes me question their interest in the safety of this country.\"  Clayborn said he understands Apple's concerns, but unlocking one phone for the FBI, he said, is \"as simple as it gets.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Hillary Clinton is closing in fast on the Democratic presidential nomination.  After losing three of four state contests in May, Clinton has maintained a lead over Bernie Sanders of 271 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses.  She is steadily picking up more support from superdelegates, the party leaders who can back any candidate of their choice, dampening Sanders’ chances further even as he insists he can win them over later this summer. In the last week, Clinton picked up 12 new superdelegate endorsements while Sanders netted two, according to an Associated Press survey.  When including superdelegates, Clinton’s lead grows to 2,305, or 97 percent of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination.  The Democratic primaries are now in a two-week break. They resume in the Virgin Islands on June 4 and Puerto Rico on June 5, with 67 delegates at stake.  Just 78 delegates short, Clinton remains on a glide path to reaching 2,383 on June 7 after polls close at 8 p.m. EDT in New Jersey.  Some things to know about the final weeks of the delegate race:  Clinton has won 23 states, while Sanders prevailed in 20. She also holds a razor-thin lead in Kentucky, where the race remained too close to call.  The last six states vote on June 7, followed by the District of Columbia on June 14.  Clinton won bigger primary states including Florida, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania and also posted blowout victories in the South. That has given her a substantial lead in delegates over Sanders based solely on primaries and caucuses, 1,768 to 1,497. Sanders was successful in smaller caucus states and won Michigan and Wisconsin.  When including superdelegates, Clinton has 2,305 to Sanders’ 1,539.  Clinton also holds an advantage of roughly 3 million raw votes, based on AP’s tabulation — 13.2 million to nearly 10.2 million for Sanders. The vote totals do not include Iowa, Nevada, Maine, Alaska, Washington and Wyoming — caucus states where the AP tabulated delegate equivalents, not raw votes; Sanders won four of them.  After a strong April finish that put her 91 percent of the way to the nomination, Clinton was slowed by a lighter primary schedule and wins by Sanders in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon. She still picked up more than 45% of the delegates at stake in May. That’s because Democrats award delegates in proportion to the vote, so the loser receives some.  Clinton is 78 delegates short.  In the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, Clinton is likely to grab around 40 delegates. That will leave her shy by more than 30, heading into June 7.  With 126 pledged delegates at stake, New Jersey offers Clinton more than what she needs to clinch — even if she were to lose the state.  Also voting June 7, in order of poll close times: North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and California. A total of 694 delegates are up for grabs.  Winning a Majority of Pledged Delegates  Because of Clinton’s big lead, Sanders must flip her superdelegates if he hopes to reach 2,383.  But first, in order to sway them, Sanders will have to win a majority of pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses, his senior strategist Tad Devine has acknowledged. Superdelegates have never before lifted a candidate to the nomination when he or she trailed in the number of pledged delegates.  “I know that it is a steep road,” Sanders said at a recent campaign rally, “but if we do very, very well in New Mexico, California and the other states on June 7, my hope is that we end this process with 50 percent plus one of the pledged delegates.”  Sanders is far behind on that front.  Clinton is on an easy path to reach 2,026 pledged delegates — or more than half the 4,051 total — on June 7. She will get there even if she loses solidly in all six states.  Sanders needs more than 67% of the remaining pledged delegates to overtake her, requiring landslide victories.  Clinton holds a substantial advantage in superdelegates — 537 to 42.  There are 714 superdelegates, meaning 135 have yet to commit.  Many are state party chairs, vice chairs or top officials such as President Barack Obama, who are declining to publicly express a preference for now. Others say they are waiting until their state’s primary or caucus are complete.  If three dozen more superdelegates decide to back Clinton in the next two weeks, she’ll reach 2,383 before the last states vote.  Among superdelegates who already support a candidate, two have flipped — but not in the direction Sanders would like. Emmett Hansen of the Virgin Islands switched to Clinton, citing the specificity of her policy proposals. In Puerto Rico, Luisette Colon was an early Clinton supporter before becoming uncommitted; last week, she flipped back to Clinton.",

Now they have the chance to own original artwork depicting the anti-hero when it goes under the hammer later this month.  Ogri creator Paul Sample decided to give others the chance of enjoying his cartoons when he started clearing his studio in preparation for a house move.  Sample first penned Ogri – a stubble-faced biker with Viking horns on his crash helmet – in 1967 after coming up with the idea while riding his BSA Rocket Gold Star. Later, the character was joined by dim Malcolm, blonde bombshell Mitzi and car-hating dog Kickstart.  “Most people think Ogri is about biking but it’s not, it’s about life in general,” Sample said. “The inspiration for most of the stories comes from riding my bike, talking to people in the pub or things on the news. I am constantly writing down ideas in a book.”  About 500 lots are expected to be auctioned by Halls of Shrewsbury on January 27, including covers for books written by Tom Sharpe, posters and advertisements.  Sample, who invented Ogri while at London’s Central School of Art in the late Sixties, said that much of his inspiration came from Marvel comics.",

        "article": "PORTLAND, Maine — High-speed ferry service will return this summer between Maine and Nova Scotia on a vessel that is smaller and faster than one that ended after two difficult seasons.  Mark MacDonald, president of the Canadian company Bay Ferries, said the company will operate a twin-hulled vessel under a lease agreement with its owner, the U.S. Navy.  The ship, USNS Puerto Rico, can make the 212-mile trip in 5 1/2 hours. The Nova Star, which ended service in October, took 11 hours to make the crossing.  The vessel is similar in size and operation to a pervious high-speed ferry that Bay Ferries operated on the same route from 2006 through 2009. That vessel was also called the CAT.  The Navy ship will be renamed the CAT.  In the one-year charter agreement signed with the Navy on Thursday, the Navy retains the right to take back the ship at any time. MacDonald said he doubts that will ever happen.  He said the Puerto Rico will be configured to carry between 700 and 750 passengers. It can carry 280 cars. It previously operated as a ferry in the Hawaiian islands under name Alakai.  The service will begin on June 15, MacDonald said. It will depart Portland daily at 2:30 p.m. and arrive in Yarmouth at 9 p.m. After spending the night in Yarmouth, the ferry will depart for Maine at 8 a.m.  The Nova Scotia government will provide a subsidy of just under $33 million (Canadian) over two years, according to a 10-year agreement.  The Puerto Rico is 349 feet long, considerably smaller than the 528-foot-long Nova Star. Its maximum speed is 40 mph, compared with the Nova Star’s 24.6 mph.  Experts in the ferry business say service on the route has a better chance of success with a smaller vessel that is less expensive to operate and can make the crossing faster.  High-speed ferries consume more fuel than conventional, single-hull ships, but fuel prices are low right now, said Gary Andrews, a ferry consultant based in England.  ‘‘More importantly, the crossing time gives it a unique selling point that the Nova Star didn’t have,’’ he said.  Bay Ferries is well-respected, knows the market and has connections in the tourism industry, all of which will be needed to help the company make up for the short notice before the season begins, said Darrell Bryan, CEO of Interferry, an international trade organization for the industry.  ‘‘It stands a far better chance of making it a successful operation,’’ he said.  Nova Scotia canceled its contract with Bay Ferries after the 2009 season because officials complained its requested $6 million annual subsidy was too high.  Its replacement, the Nova Star, was far more costly.  The Puerto Rico was built in Mobile, Alabama, in 2007 for Hawaii Superferry LLC and designed to operate in the Hawaiian islands. The federal government obtained the vessel after Hawaii Superferry went bankrupt in 2009.  The province spent $28.5 million (Canadian) for the service in the Nova Star’s first season in 2014. Last year, the government limited its subsidy to $13 million, equal to nearly $10 million (U.S.). The service’s financial troubles led a federal court to order the seizure of the Nova Star in October after several companies complained that they were owed more than $3 million.",

        "article": "Hippie musical \"Hair,\" high on '60s flower power and free love, has again reached London. The latest revival of this 1968 New York show, starring an American cast, opened the other night at the Gielgud Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. Its message: Take drugs, screw around, be happy!  The aging left is in ecstasy. Its cultural dupes love \"Hair\" for its assault on the Vietnam War. They love the way a red communist flag is held up as a symbol of beauty. They wallow in the idea of group sex without responsibility. They can lie back and dream that they never grew up to became office donkeys in dreary suburban homes with mortgages and whining, unemployed offspring.  A few years ago, when AIDS was the fashionable cause, lefties would bore the pants off the rest of us by stressing the importance of safe sex. Yet condoms are not mentioned once in \"Hair,\" and we have not had a single protest from the sex education lobby about the show. Tut tut. Can they be losing their hunger for hectoring the rest of us? That seems hard to believe. Perhaps they are simply making special allowances for a musical that is regarded as one of the great calls to anti-capitalism. A jolly profitable one at that. Impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who is involved with this revival, could make a tidy turn if early houses are any guide.  Lest you forget, \"Hair\" is about a group of 20-something students in Manhattan who seem to do nothing except bonk one another and ingest catering-sized quantities of dope and acid. The costumes department at the Gielgud must have run short of tie-dye skirts and cheesecloth shirts.  There is a chaste little group nude scene, for which the lights are dimmed. The girls are almost all terrifically pretty--unlike some of the mustachioed horrors who attended Woodstock--and the boys seem to be toned and, many of them, tanned with perfect teeth. How many real hippies pumped weights and spent thousands on their gnashers? The nude scene was wildly daring for its day, but nudity is now almost de rigueur at certain London theaters. Nor is the extra-marital legover or the drug-taking in \"Hair\" much of a revelation today. We are shown this sort of thing all the time, sometimes with syringes or on-stage depictions of oral sex.  The plot of \"Hair\" is pretty slim, but it concerns the plight of one of the group, Claude, who is called up to serve with the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Should he answer the draft, or should he dodge it? The leader of the group is an alpha hippie male called Berger. He encourages others to burn their draft cards. When Claude decides to join the Army, Berger is appalled.  We all know what happened to the rich kids like Berger who managed to wriggle out of Vietnam. They survived and went on to run the United States--its government and its corporations--in the 1990s. Boys from blue-collar families tended to have less success staying away from the war zone. They died while defending the freedom of the hippies to behave like indolent wastrels.  \"Hair\" opens with the hit song \"Age of Aquarius,\" and the music is not bad. But what about the morality of this show? Given what we have learned about drugs since the 1960s, not to mention casual sex, can it still be counted such an innocent amusement? Does the historical context of the show not demand that the hippies be shown to have been hopelessly wrong on some of their arguments?  At this point the left bridles. Those of us who have voiced criticism of \"Hair\" have been given a terrible bashing. We have been mocked like the two old men in the Muppet Show who sat up in the box, grumbling about Kermit the Frog's show. We have been told to stop taking art so seriously, to stop being reactionary fuddy-duddies, to get with the program, to soak up the vibes, to accept \"Hair\" as a work of liberation.",

        "article": "Minmetals would gain access to Equinox’s Lumwana project in Zambia, which processes about 20 million tons of ore per year into a copper concentrate. Source: Equinox Minerals Ltd. via Bloomberg  Minmetals Resources Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Michelmore. Photographer: Jerome Favre/Bloomberg  China’s need to acquire metal deposits in Africa is leading traders to bet that Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) will increase its offer for Australia’s Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) more than any pending deal in Asia.  Equinox rose to C$7.55 yesterday, 7.9 percent more than the C$7-a-share offer from Minmetals, a unit of state-owned China Minmetals Group. The level above the bid was the largest of any takeover in Asia greater than $1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS AG said fair value for a purchase of Equinox is C$8.28, 18 percent higher than the original proposal.  The unsolicited bid of C$6.04 billion ($6.2 billion), including net debt, would give Minmetals control of Perth-based Equinox’s copper mine in Zambia after demand from China drove the metal to a record price this year. The company is pursuing China’s biggest mining takeover after the country helped rebuild the Democratic Republic of Congo three years ago for access to copper and cobalt. Africa will account for 9.8 percent of the world’s copper output this year, UBS forecasts.  “The Chinese are back in the acquisition game,” said John Stephenson, a Toronto-based fund manager at First Asset Investment Management Inc. who helps oversee about C$2 billion including Equinox shares. “Copper is a strategic metal and they are very concerned about assuring their supply of materials that will allow them to continue to compete internationally. They want Equinox and they’re going to get it.”  Michael Vaughan, a spokesman for Equinox, declined to comment. The company’s shares rose 1 cent to C$7.56 at 4:10 p.m. today in Toronto.  Miche Paterson and Nick Maher, representatives for Minmetals, weren’t available for comment.  Minmetals would gain access to Equinox’s Lumwana project in Zambia, which processes about 20 million tons of ore per year into a copper concentrate. Equinox is aiming to produce 145,000 tons of copper this year, according to its website. Equinox also bought the biggest copper deposit in Saudi Arabia in January, and its first production is expected in 2012.  Minmetals of Hong Kong owns the world’s second-biggest zinc mine and other assets in Australia, Laos and Canada. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Michelmore said in January he was targeting acquisitions of copper, lead and zinc mines. Its parent company is China’s biggest metals trader.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange traded at a record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15. The metal, which is used in electric cables and plumbing, will average $9,750 this year and $10,150 in 2012, according to the median of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Mining companies haven’t kept pace with demand because reserves are becoming harder to find and the quality of ore is declining, meaning less copper is extracted from each ton of rock.  Equinox closed 7.9 percent above Minmetals’ bid in Toronto trading yesterday, the biggest gap for any pending deal involving a company from developed markets in the Asia-Pacific region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fair value for control of Equinox is about C$8.28 a share, based on copper forecasts and the value of its assets, Onno Rutten, a Toronto-based analyst with UBS, wrote yesterday. A bid of at least C$8 a share from Minmetals, which is seeking approval from more than two-thirds of Equinox’s investors, may be enough to get shareholders’ attention, according to David Davidson, an analyst at Paradigm Capital Inc. in Toronto.  “You can rest assured it’s not going to be C$7,” Davidson said. “You probably have room to negotiate the price higher.”  Minmetals’ offer valued Equinox’s equity at 24 times earnings, the most in a copper deal greater than $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An acquisition at yesterday’s closing price of C$7.55 would be worth 9.8 times next year’s profit, which is projected to double from 2010 to a record. That’s in line with the 9.73 median ratio for publicly traded copper miners with market capitalizations greater than $1 billion, the data show.  It “will end up being a very attractive price for China’s Minmetals,” said John Goldsmith, a Toronto-based fund manager at Montrusco Bolton Investments Inc., which oversees about C$4.9 billion. “We’re dealing with a much higher copper price environment right now.”  Africa’s copper production may grow as much as 10 percent annually for the next five to 10 years, Tom Price, a commodity analyst for UBS in Sydney, said in an interview.  China has been acquiring mining assets across the continent. State-owned Jinchuan Group Ltd., China’s largest platinum producer, agreed on takeover terms with Johannesburg- based Wesizwe (WEZ) Platinum Ltd. in December. The deal includes a debt commitment, giving Wesizwe $877 million to build its first mine in South Africa, the world’s largest supplier of platinum.  China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group of Shenzhen, the nation’s second-largest reactor builder, made a 756 million- pound ($1.2 billion) bid for London-based Kalahari Minerals Plc (KAH) last month that would give the state-owned company access to Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT)’s Husab uranium project in Namibia. Kalahari owns about 43 percent of Perth-based Extract.  The Equinox deal is China’s largest ever proposed takeover of a mining company, and the 32 percent premium over the 20-day trading average is the most a Chinese company has paid for a mining deal greater than $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Minmetals has been studying Equinox for “well over a year” and built a 4.2 percent stake in the company during 2010, CEO Michelmore said on a media conference call this week.  Equinox shares had declined 8.9 percent before Minmetals’ offer since announcing a C$4.6 billion unsolicited bid for Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) Feb. 28, which must be withdrawn if Minmetals prevails. Toronto-based Lundin rejected the offer March 20, and Equinox today extended the offer to April 29.  Minmetals’ acquisition requires approval from Chinese and Australian regulators. The company said it lodged an application with Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board on March 11.  “The market is saying it expects it to get done and with more money on the table,” First Asset’s Stephenson said. “If you’re an Equinox shareholder, this is pretty darn good.”  Overall, there have been 6,313 deals announced globally this year, totaling $646 billion, a 27 percent increase from the $510 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Next week, oral arguments are set to begin in an appeal made by the college sports association in the case of O'Bannon v. NCAA, a suit originally brought by Ed O'Bannon, who played on the 1995 national championship basketball team from UCLA.  Last August, federal Judge Claudia Wilken in O'Bannon v. NCAA ruled that the association violated antitrust law by prohibiting athletes from the Football Bowl Subdivision—the roughly 125 schools formerly known as Division 1-A—and Division 1 men's basketball from being compensated for use of their names, images and likenesses.  Wilken ordered that schools be allowed to offer the athletes full cost-of-attendance scholarships and place up to $5,000 per athlete, per year of eligibility, into a trust. Cost-of-attendance scholarships allow universities to increase the amount of money they provide to athletes to cover cost-of-living expenses that fall outside of the bounds of current NCAA scholarships.  The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment.  Read MoreNCAA pool is worth $15,000—if you can write code  Some conferences have begun allowing members to offer full cost-of-attendance scholarships. Now, schools have to figure out how to cover for the extra cost.  \"Funding full cost of attendance scholarships will impact our budget by approximately $1.7 million,\" said Phil Esten, Penn State's deputy director of athletics and chief operating officer, who added that some schools are funding them \"from their operational budget, while others are seeking increased university subsidies. In many cases, it's a combination.\"  Schools in conferences without lucrative television deals have fewer options from which to find funding.  \"Some mid-major conference schools are scratching their heads, asking how they'll get the money,\" said an athletics director at a mid-major university who wished to remain anonymous. \"Some are raising ticket prices.

His firm, Soros Fund Management LLC, has lost about 6% so far this year through the second quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter. That compares with a gain of 7.5% for the Standard & Poors 500, and a loss of 2.3% for the average macro hedge-fund manager through the first half of the year, according to Hedge Fund Research. Last year, the firm gained 2.5%, below the nearly 13% price gain for the S&P 500.  A letter to investors dated Tuesday said the firms chief investment officer, Keith Anderson, decided to leave the firm in connection with the decision to return money to outside investors.  Earlier this year, Mr. Anderson, the firms chief investment officer, turned cautious with the firms investments, amid concerns about the European and U.S. debt situations. That made it harder to keep up with the markets gains. Mr. Anderson also bailed out of many gold and silver investments, according to someone familiar with the matter. Those steps hurt as gold recently raced to record levels. Mr. Anderson on Tuesday wasnt available for comment.  Mr. Anderson, who previously was chief investment officer of BlackRock Inc., scored annualized gains of 8.5% during his tenure at Soros, which began in February 2008.  Mr. Soros in the past has shown displeasure with his chief investment officers during rough periods in the market. In the spring of 2000, Mr. Soros announced the departure of Stanley Druckenmiller, who at the time quarterbacked his firm, after losses of about 25% for two of Mr. Soross hedge funds. At the time, Mr. Soros said he would farm out his money to other managers and invest in a more conservative manner.  Mr. Soros subsequently switched gears, hiring various executives in turn to helm this firm, while keeping some money with outside investors. Some of those executives didnt stick around for very long. Some chafed at Mr. Soross management style, feeling he second-guessed their moves, according to people close to the matter. Mr. Soross son Robert, the eldest of his five children, also served in the position for two stints in the last decade.  Mr. Anderson long has avoided the limelight, even as Mr. Soros sometimes courts media attention. Tuesday, Mr. Anderson was on vacation with his wifes family in Sweden, according to someone familiar with the matter, a country he visits each summer.  –Steve Eder and Jenny Strasburg contributed to this post.",

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting its own test to verify the case.  Health care worker Craig Spencer, 33, had returned last week to the U.S. from Guinea, one of the three West African countries hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak. He is now being treated in an isolation unit at Bellevue Hospital, Mayor Bill de Blasio told a press conference late Thursday.  “We want to state at the outset that there is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed,” de Blasio said. “The Health Department has a team of disease detective who have been at work tracing all of the patient’s contacts and we are prepared to quarantine contacts as necessary.”  Spencer is understood to have traveled on the A, 1 and L trains and visited a bowling alley called “The Gutter” before starting to display symptoms. Ebola victims are only transmit the virus after they become symptomatic, however.  The New York Times quoted city health commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett as saying that Spencer “did not have a stage of disease that creates a risk of contagiousness on the subway.”  “We consider it extremely unlikely, the probability being close to nil, that there will be any problem related to his taking the subway system,” she added.  In contrast to nurse Amber Vinson, who was allowed by the CDC to board a commercial flight despite already having a fever, Spencer did not leave his apartment after reporting symptoms and was isolated within two hours of reporting them, according to the NYT.  TIME reported that New York City previously designated Bellevue Hospital to receive any Ebola patients that should enter the city. Bellevue has also been preparing to accept Ebola patients from other hospitals if need be. New York City hospitals in general have been preparing and drilling for the possibility of a patient with Ebola since August, most recently by holding an an Ebola education session for over 5,000 local health care workers on Tuesday.  The World Health Organization said earlier this week that the number of cases in the outbreak, which started in August, has now risen to just under 10,000, with roughly half ending in death so far. The disease is ravaging Sierra Leone and Liberia, and is spreading in Guinea, but it has been stopped from spreading in Nigeria and Senegal, the WHO says.

The peacekeepers were detained on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights during a \"period of increased fighting between armed elements and the Syrian Arab Armed Forces,\" the office of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. It said another 81 peacekeepers are \"currently being restricted to their positions in the vicinity of Ar Ruwayhinah and Burayqah.\"  The statement did not specify which armed group is holding the peacekeepers. Various Syrian rebel groups, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, have been fighting the Syrian military near the Golan Heights. On Wednesday, opposition fighters captured a Golan Heights crossing point on the disputed border between Syria and Israel.  UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the 43 detained peacekeepers are from Fiji and are thought to be in the southern part of the area of separation. The 81 troops from the Philippines had their movements restricted.

(Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)  A member of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) rides atop an armoured vehicle near the Quneitra border crossing on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights Wednesday. (Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)  \"The situation is extremely fluid. Obviously, we are very concerned,\" Dujarric said.  \"We are dealing with non-state armed actors,\" he said. \"The command and control of these groups is unclear. We're not in a position to confirm who is holding whom. Some groups self-identified as being affiliated with al-Nusra, however, we are unable to confirm it.\"  The statement said the United Nations \"is making every effort to secure the release of the detained peacekeepers,\" who are part of UNDOF, the mission that has been monitoring a 1974 disengagement accord between Syria and Israel put in place after the 1973 Six Day War.  Philippines military spokesman Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala said in a statement later that Syrian rebels demanded that the Filipino troops surrender their firearms, but the soldiers refused.  \"They did not surrender their firearms as they may in turn be held hostage themselves. This resulted in a stand-off which is still the prevailing situation at this time,\" Zagala said.  Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said \"Canada strongly condemns the capture\" of the UN forces, as well as the \"forced restrictions of movement by armed opposition forces in the Golan Heights.\"  In a statement released Thursday afternoon, Baird said Canada calls on \"all parties to respect the impartiality of UN peacekeepers and their freedom of movement, safety and security.\"  In response to a CBC News inquiry, the Department of National Defence said three Canadians who are part of UNDOF were not detained and are safe and accounted for.  The Quneitra crossing on the Golan is a strategic plateau captured by Israel in a 1967 Middle East war. Syria and Israel technically remain at war and are separated by a narrow buffer zone known as the area of separation that was established under a 1973 ceasefire formalized in 1974.  The Security Council condemned the detention of the 43 peacekeepers and the restriction of movement of the other 81 and called for their immediate release. A rapidly drafted press statement blamed \"Security Council-designated terrorist groups\" and \"members of non-state armed groups.\"  In June, the UN Security Council strongly condemned the intense fighting between Syrian government and opposition fighters in the Golan Heights and demanded an end to all military activity in the area. Syrian mortars overshooting their target have repeatedly hit the Israeli-controlled Golan, and UN peacekeepers have been abducted.  Thursday's statement noted that UNDOF peacekeepers who were detained by armed forces in March and May were later safely released.  As of July, UNDOF has 1,223 troops from six countries: Fiji, India, Ireland, Nepal, Netherlands and the Philippines.  But the Philippine government last week said it would bring home its 331 peacekeeping forces from the Golan Heights after their tour of duty ends in October, amid the deteriorating security in the region.  In June 2013, Austria said it was withdrawing its 377 UN peacekeepers from the Golan Heights. Croatia also withdrew in 2013 amid fears its troops would be targeted.",

        "article": "Except that the 2012 presidential campaign has proceeded much as they predicted. Both parties’ campaigns have been largely conducted according to their theory.  The shape of the race was set in early summer. In April, May and June, job creation dipped well below 100,000 — some of the worst economic news since the worst days of the Great Recession. Public approval for Obama’s handling of the economy dropped. Political scientists often argue that public impressions about the state of the economy get locked in during the summer before a presidential election. In the doldrums of 2012, Americans determined they wanted economic change — though they were not yet convinced that Mitt Romney could deliver it.  The Obama campaign fully internalized this political reality. It could not talk of “morning in America” during a continuing economic twilight. In a remarkable New York magazine article by John Heilemann this May, senior Obama aides frankly described the task ahead — delegitimizing Romney. He would be attacked as a vulture capitalist, a cultural revanchist, a social Darwinist. “For anyone still starry-eyed about Obama,” said Heilemann, “the months ahead will provide a bracing revelation about what he truly is: not a savior, not a saint, not a man above the fray, but a brass-knuckled, pipe-hitting, red-in-tooth-and-claw brawler.”  “Bracing” does not fully capture it. Throughout the summer, the Obama campaign and its allies accused Romney of not paying taxes, of possibly committing a felony, of personally outsourcing jobs to China and India, of stashing money in the Cayman Islands, of bearing responsibility for a woman’s death from cancer. The attempt to discredit Romney had an added political benefit. A presidential campaign consumed by the jabs and parries of the 24-hour news cycle was less focused on larger matters such as the economy.  During this period, the Romney campaign was also operating from the Schoen-Caddell script. Instead of making bold strategic moves or conducting unexpected outreach, it was single-minded in its focus on economic conditions — without much apparent effect.  For almost four weeks — from the end of the Democratic convention to the first presidential debate — the Obama strategy seemed to be prevailing. The president rose above 50 percent in the polls. Many in the media accepted the narrative of Obama’s inevitability. Romney’s campaign, in turn, was criticized as the worst in history.  Then came the Denver debate, remarkable both for the scale of its impact and the ease — even simplicity — of Romney’s accomplishment. Obama did not commit any serious gaffes. Romney did not display an innovative strategy or deliver any crushing, historically memorable one-liners. He sounded reasonable, he forcefully pressed his economic case and he handily cleared the hurdle of acceptability. It was enough to end the four-week aberration and return the race to a competitive state.  Since the summer, both campaigns have been the flip sides of the same analysis: For Obama, avoid talking about the performance of the economy and destroy Romney’s credibility. For Romney, talk about the economy and establish that he is not a monster. Neither approach will be remembered for its creativity. There is no reason that Obama could not have added a more compelling second-term agenda. And Romney may come to regret his lack of effective outreach. Demography is a harsh, inexorable opponent. On the morning after Romney’s victory celebration — if there is one — Republicans will wake with a Hispanic hangover.  An Obama win — with an assist by Ohio — would vindicate the president’s campaign game plan. But the Schoen-Caddell prediction still holds: Obama will have left the nation divided, disillusioned and less governable.",

It is the fourth Category 5 storm on Earth this year, which is close to the annual average of between four and five such storms.  Super Typhoon Meranti, which according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center had maximum sustained winds of 155 knots, or nearly 180 miles per hour, as of Monday evening eastern time, has southern Taiwan and coastal China in its sights for the middle of the week.  Fluctuations in the storm's intensity are likely before Meranti makes its closest pass to southern Taiwan on Wednesday, but it is likely to still be a powerful Typhoon at that time. Taiwan's second-most populous city, Kaohsiung City, is located in the southwest part of the island.  Super Typhoon Meranti is the seventh category 4 or 5 storm to form during the Northern Hemisphere's 2016 storm season, but beat Super Typhoon Nepartak in terms of its estimated maximum sustained winds.  The forecast calls for the storm to be weaker when it passes close to, if not over, parts of Taiwan on Sept. 14.  Computer model projections show the storm may pass through the Luzon strait to the south of Taiwan while weakening from a major typhoon to a Category 1 or 2 storm before it hits the Chinese mainland on Sept. 15.  The storm could hit the port city of Hong Kong, which has a population of more than 7.2 million people, on Sept. 15.  The intensity of the storm at that point will greatly depend on whether or not it first makes landfall in Taiwan, however, which would cause greater weakening than if its center were to remain over the sea.  On satellite imagery Monday, the storm resembles a textbook image of a powerful typhoon. It is converting heat built up in the ocean into towering, spiraling thunderstorms, with a pinpoint-sized eye in the middle, where the air pressure is lowest.  In the narrow ring of storms surrounding the eye, known as the \"eye wall,\" the storm may be capable of producing wind gusts of nearly 215 miles per hour, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.",

The previous auction record for an American painting was for \"Polo Crowd'' by George Bellows, which sold for $27.7 million in 1999.  \"This is just a wonderful result for American art and for Rockwell,'' Elizabeth Goldberg, the head of Sotheby's American Art department, said in an interview.  \"It is largely considered one of his great masterpieces,'' she added.  Two telephone bidders, who have not been identified, battled for more than nine minutes to buy the prized work.  Wednesday's auction is the latest in a series of record-breaking sales this year which art experts say is fueled by the ultrarich with surplus capital, low interest rates and confidence in the art market.  Francis Bacon's 1969 triptych, \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud,'' fetched $142.4 million last month in New York to become the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.  Goldberg said it was fitting that Rockwell, who died in 1978 at age 84 and painted nostalgic and amusing scenes of everyday American life over the course of some 65 years, should hold the American record.  \"When people, not only in this country but around the world, think of American art, they think of Norman Rockwell,'' she said. \"I think it really speaks to the desire for masterworks by well recognized American artists.''  \"Saying Grace'' was one of seven works by the American painter and illustrator in the sale from the family of Kenneth J. Stuart Sr., the art editor of The Saturday Evening Post who was Rockwell's longtime friend. The paintings sold for a total of $60 million.  The previous auction record for Rockwell was $15.4 million for \"Breaking Home Ties,'' which sold in 2006. The total from Sotheby's American art auction was $84 million.",

Gjonaj is vying to be the first Albanian-American elected to public office in the Bronx.  To become the first Albanian-American elected to public office in the Bronx, a local real estate agent will need to defeat an incumbent from a powerful political family with Bronx Democratic County Committee support.  Mark Gjonaj, a Democrat and the current Bronx commissioner of the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, launched his 2012 state Assembly campaign Sunday in Morris Park.  The Bronx native will run against current Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera, also a Democrat, for the 80th Assembly District seat. The district includes Pelham Parkway, Pelham Gardens, Allerton and part of Bedford Park.  He told the Daily News he plans to focus on programs for seniors, public safety and jobs.  \"In life, we either accept things for what they are or we become part of it and try to find a solution for what we don't agree with,\" said Gjonaj, 43, born to Albanian parents from Montenegro.  Elected to the Assembly in 2004 and 2008, Rivera is the sister of City Councilman Joel Rivera and the daughter of longtime Assemblyman Jose Rivera. She has sponsored about 30 bills over the past year and has crusaded against domestic violence.  \"I look forward to a vigorous and exciting reelection and to putting forward my record of accomplishments on behalf of the people of the 80th Assembly District,\" she said in a statement.  Bronx party leader and Assemblyman Carl Heastie said the county committee will back Rivera \"1000%\" because she has \"done well in Albany.\"  Roughly 9,500 people in the Bronx now identify as Albanian, up from 7,000 in 2000, according to census reports. Many live in the 80th Assembly District, near Pelham Parkway and Allerton Ave.  Gjonaj grew up on Arthur Ave. in Belmont, where his immigrant father worked as a building superintendent. He attended St. Raymond High School for Boys in Parkchester and St. John's University in Queens.  His parents later started a real estate company in Morris Park, M.P. Realty Group. Now overseen by Gjonaj, it owns several hundred housing units, he said.  Gjonaj was an outspoken critic of the state redistricting process that removed part of Morris Park from the 80th Assembly District this spring. He boasts ties to the neighborhood and is counting on Morris Park for votes.  Gjonaj moved to City Island in the 82nd Assembly District about 10 years ago. He said candidates are allowed to run for state office outside their home district during redistricting years.  Gjonaj will campaign for the construction of affordable housing and for less regulation on small business owners, he said.  The new 80th Assembly District is 23% white, 21% black and 45% Hispanic. In 2002, the old district was 38% white, 17% black and 32% Hispanic.  Gjonaj has yet to receive a major endorsement. The state primary election is slated for Sept. 11.",

        "article": "Another advantage is the upside down goblet or beaker. Rather than a jug to hold the ingredients, with the blades at the bottom, with the bullet blenders you fill a beaker, screw the blade section on top, then invert the whole caboodle on to the motor base. This makes them prone to leaking, but means that you can use the beaker to drink out of, without feeling like an unhousetrained teenager - they all come with screw on rims or sports lids to make sipping more comfortable. But with the exception of the machines that blend straight into a sports bottle like the Davina Personal Blender below or the AEG Sport Mini Mixer (£99.99 from johnlewis.com ) the beakers make pretty ungainly drinking receptacles.  Hang on though, you say – I’ve got five hundred quid’s worth of super blender – Vitamix, Sage Boss, whatever. Well, in that case you probably don’t need a bullet blender, as you are already reducing organic matter to pulp at the touch of a button.  The real advantage of these machines is that they are far less expensive than the superblenders, with a Nutribullet starting at under £80 and the highly rated NutriNinja under £70 (from £69.99 from argos.com). Still too much? There are lots of Nutribullet lookalike bargain models around. This week Lidl brought out their version for £29.99, and Aldi will be following suit on 18th February. But do the cheaper versions cut the mustard – or rather kale? I pitted three of the cut-price competitors against a Nutribullet to see how they measured up.  Most operate by a twist function, but some of the older models of bullet blender need to be held down continuously – fine for short blitzes but annoying if you’re making something that takes longer blending. Plus these machines are noisy, and they vibrate – so standing and leaning on a your blender makes morning-after-the-night before nutrition fixes pretty nerve jangling. Far better to be able to switch on and walk away. The only one of the four I tested this week which needed to be held down was the Davina Personal Blender, but since that’s designed for quick fixes rather than pounding nut butters, it’s not a huge problem.  Most machines should only be operated from 30-60 seconds before they need to cool down for a minute or two. Opt for at least a minute if you want to do tougher jobs like making nut butter.  The largest beaker on the Nutribullet holds 32 ounces – some of the smaller models hold far less. Small is fine for one person smoothies, but if you want to blend soup, for example, larger capacity is better.  Check the wattage – higher wattage means more power, which generally translates into better, smoother results, although other factors like motor design play a part too.  The best indication of how robust a machine is, is the length of the guarantee. 1 year is minimum, 3 years is ideal.  A few machines offer high and low speed functions, but the point of these blenders is to go hard and fast. One speed is plenty, as long as it’s high speed.  Promises of seventeen different attachments are tempting but where are you going to put them all? These machines are meant to save space, not fill it. Look for a small beaker for grinding and a large one for liquidizing, plus whatever lids you need. Two sets of blades – a double ended blade for grinding, and one with 4 or 6 blades for liquidizing - is useful but not vital, as the liquidizing ones will do a pretty good job at grinding too.  I tested the four blenders by making  · a kale, apple, ginger and pineapple smoothie  · a thick, creamy hummus  · almond milk using whole almonds, soaked overnight in water  · a frozen Margarita (using whole ice cubes) because a blender is for life, not just for Dry January.  All of these were blended for the same amount of time in each blender (with breaks for the motor to cool where necessary) and the final results compared. For the smoothie and the almond milk the results were strained to assess the amount of solids in the mixture.  (all prices correct at time of writing)  Widely available, the Hinari blender seems to be modeled on the Magic Bullet, the Nutribullet’s smaller, lower powered little sister. Like many younger siblings, it’s a bit over ambitious, promising to juice, blend, chop, mix, grind, puree, whip and grate.",

        "article": "Erich Schlegel for The New York Times  Robert Mayfield, who owns Dairy Queen franchises in Texas, says he is âscared to deathâ of the new health care law.  Like many franchisees, Robert U. Mayfield, who owns five Dairy Queens in and around Austin, Tex., is always eager to expand and — no surprise — has had his eyes on opening a sixth DQ. But he said concerns about the new federal health care law had persuaded him to hold off.  “I’m scared to death of it,” he said. “I’m one of the ones sitting on the sidelines to see what’s really going to happen.”  Mr. Mayfield, who has 99 employees, said he was worried he would face penalties of $40,000 or more because he did not offer health insurance to many of his full-time workers — generally defined as those working an average of 30 hours a week or more. Ever since the law was enacted in 2010, opponents have argued that employers who were forced to offer health insurance would lay off workers or shift more people to part-time status to compensate for the additional cost. Those claims have drawn considerable attention — and considerable anger in response — in recent weeks.  John H. Schnatter, the chief executive of Papa John’s, the pizza chain, said some franchisees were likely to reduce their employees’ hours to avoid having to provide coverage. And an unhappy Denny’s franchise owner in Florida warned that he would raise prices 5 percent as a “surcharge,” adding that disgruntled customers could offset that by reducing their tips.  Some health care experts said comments like those came from outliers and sometimes resulted from confusion about a highly complicated new law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Many of the provisions do not go into effect until 2014. Federal officials are still tweaking the fine print, like defining exactly what constitutes a 30-hour workweek. Even so, restaurants and hotels are among the industries likely to be squeezed the hardest by the law because they are low-wage industries that do not offer coverage to most of their workers.  Most employers, even small businesses, already offer health insurance, and the federal law is not expected to have a significant impact on what they do over the next year or so. But businesses that rely heavily on low-income workers, many of whom do not make enough to afford their share of the cost of the insurance premiums, are being forced to rethink their business models.  Almost half of retail and hospitality employers do not offer coverage to all their full-time employees, according to a recent survey by Mercer, a benefits consultant.  “They’re all developing their strategies,” said Debra Gold, a senior partner with Mercer who advises several major retailers.  Many who oppose the requirement say the cost of providing health insurance could mean hiring fewer workers. “Any dollar that gets diverted, whether it’s through Obamacare or increased tax rates, puts franchisees one dollar further away from being able to expand their businesses,” said Don Fox, chief executive of Firehouse Subs, a fast-growing chain of 559 restaurants based in Jacksonville, Fla. At the 30 stores the corporation owns, only full-time managers are offered coverage. Mr. Fox is wrestling with whether to absorb the considerable cost of covering 100 more employees or pay the penalties — which would probably cost him less — but risk losing valued employees to competitors who choose to offer coverage.  Employee health coverage now averages nearly $6,000 for an individual plan. That is considerable for businesses like restaurants in which the majority of workers make $24,000 a year or less, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation found that only 28 percent of companies that employ large numbers of low-income workers offer health benefits. “This is where the biggest set of hurdles is,” said Gary Claxton, an executive with Kaiser.  By 2014, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees will be expected to offer as yet undefined affordable coverage, based on an employee’s income. For employers that fail to offer such coverage, the law typically calls for a penalty of $2,000 a worker, excluding the first 30 employees. As evidence of how sensitive the issue is, Mr. Schnatter of Papa John’s took some heat for his initial statements about the possibility that franchisees would cut employees’ hours to avoid penalties or having to provide coverage. His comments, made during a public appearance, were reported by a local newspaper in Florida, The Naples News. After facing a storm of criticism, he wrote an opinion piece for The Huffington Post, in which he said he had only been speculating about the law’s potential impact on franchisees.  “Papa John’s, like most businesses, is still researching what the Affordable Care Act means to our operations,” he wrote. “Regardless of the conclusion of our analysis, we will honor this law, as we do all laws, and continue to offer 100 percent of Papa John’s corporate employees and workers in company-owned stores health insurance as we have since the company was founded in 1984.” Through a spokesman, Mr. Schnatter declined to comment further.

        "article": "Bandals International Inc., a maker of women's sandals, raised roughly $100,000 in capital from so-called angel investors last year.  When meeting with potential investors, the owners of the Rochester Hills, Mich., business touted the state's special tax break for angels—a term used to describe wealthy individuals who provide capital to start-ups. The Michigan incentive at the time allowed angels to seek tax credits of 25% on their 2011 investments in qualified start-ups.  Tom Sesti, president of Bandals, says the tax credit was key to helping the three-year-old company raise the funds. \"It's almost like offering a money-back guarantee,\" he says.  Tom Sesti is president of Bandals, a Michigan sandal maker that raised $100,000 from angels last year.  Tax breaks for angel investors have cropped up in recent years in about two dozen states as a means of stimulating job growth. But the effectiveness of the incentives—which range from breaks on 15% of funding in Colorado to 100% in Hawaii—are coming under greater scrutiny, particularly as states face budget pressure. Many states' programs expired at the end of 2011, were stripped of funding or were placed under a moratorium.  The incentives \"can be controversial,\" said the National Governors Association in a 2008 brief, adding that \"even angels are in disagreement as to the economic growth benefits of tax credits.\"  U.S. companies are booking higher profits than ever. Yet corporate tax receipts as a share of profits are at their lowest level in at least 40 years. Damien Paletta reports on Markets Hub. Photo: AFP.  \"People rarely make a high-risk investment solely for tax reasons,\" says Scott Shane, a business financing researcher at Case Western Reserve University, and a member of the North Coast Angel network. He says tax credits likely do very little to boost investing—and even less to create jobs. \"If I think I'm going to lose my money, a tax credit isn't going to make up for that,\" he says.  In the first six months of a program launched in Minnesota in 2010, 67 businesses received $28 million in total funding from a mix of individual investors and certified funds, according to a 2011 report by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. The program offered angels a 25% tax credit.  Yet together, the businesses that received funding created only 47 new jobs, the report found.  \"These are emerging companies, so they don't necessarily rush out and hire new employees,\" says Jeffrey Nelson, the state program coordinator.  However, Mr. Nelson pointed to a so-called spillover effect, as newly funded firms hire local contractors and other third-party services.  Minnesota's program is now growing, he says. Last year, investors claimed all $16 million in available tax credits under the program, which is set to expire in 2014, pending a review by state lawmakers.  \"I've heard from entrepreneurs who say 'I would not have funding without this program,'\" he says.  Brook Eddy, founder of Bhakti Chai in Boulder, Colo., which sells tea at Whole Foods and other grocery store outlets as well as cafes, says the state's 15% tax-credit program helped her raise $125,000 in funding in 2010.  \"When we met with potential investors, it was like having an extra bonus to offer them,\" she says.  Colorado's angel program expired at the start of 2011.  Of course, only a fraction of the nation's small businesses are high-growth start-ups that might draw the attention of angel investors.  In one survey by Pepperdine University of more than 10,000 small-business owners last August and September, only 3% cited angels as a source of financing. Roughly half said they tapped credit cards and bank loans.  Meanwhile, Michigan's angel investor tax credit expired Dec. 31, leaving some entrepreneurs in the state disappointed.  \"Investing is risky, but if you have a trump card to play, like a tax credit, it helps,\" says David Weaver, whose Ann Arbor, Mich., medical device firm, Blaze Medical Devices, raised $250,000 in a funding round in 2011. He says he believes the tax credits helped persuade local investors to act before the Dec. 31 deadline.  Eli Thomssen applied early to the state's economic development agency to have his biotech firm, also based in Ann Arbor, on a list of that state's eligible small-business investments.

        "article": "BY Roger Rubin DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER  Updated Thursday, September 17th 2009, 10:24 AM  The Yankees will juggle starters A.J. Burnett, Andy Pettitte and CC Sabathia as they prepare their playoff lineup.  The Yankees are a near-lock for the playoffs and that means Joe Girardi has some hard decisions to make in the next three weeks. None is more important than how he lines up the starting rotation.  Girardi has time - and a huge cushion in the standings - on his side. There's time for Andy Pettitte's shoulder to get better, time for A.J. Burnett to work through kinks with catcher Jorge Posada and time to properly align everyone.  \"In the last week of the season, the Yankees won't be playing to get in and that's a huge advantage. In the first round they'll get to pitch the guys they want in the games they want,\" one former AL manager said. \"A team that's just going to squeak in might have to use their best pitchers the last day or two of the (regular) season. (That team) could end up in a five-game series with three games being pitched by their No. 3 and No. 4 (pitchers).\"  CC Sabathia is a Cy Young candidate with a poor postseason resume. Burnett has been maddeningly inconsistent en route to 11 wins, one fewer than Carl Pavano. Pettitte was having a great season before shoulder fatigue surfaced. And the plan to limit Joba Chamberlain's innings has turned July's lethal weapon into September's mystery.  What's a manager to do? The Daily News' plan for the first round - almost certainly against Detroit - is to go with Sabathia, Pettitte and Burnett in that order. Chamberlain can pitch in a number of roles out of the bullpen before returning to the rotation if the Bombers advance.  Here are some factors and strategies that have to be considered:  THE ACE FACTOR: Sabathia signed a $161 million contract in the offseason to be the Yankees' ace and he has delivered. He also is finishing the season strong. In his last nine starts he is 7-0 with a 2.48 ERA and has gone at least 6-2/3 innings in each.  \"CC's is the closest thing they have to a sure thing so he has to go in Game 1,\" one MLB team executive said. \"If anyone has to start two games, you want it to be your ace.\"  THE VENUE STRATEGY: Burnett appears to be the pick to go second, because Game 2 would likely be at the Stadium, where he is 5-3 with a 3.65ERA. In road games, the righthander is 6-6 with a 5.12ERA and at Detroit's Comerica Park, his ERA is 9.42.  Pettitte has been outstanding away from home, going 8-2 with a 3.52 ERA, so pitching Game 3 on the road would appear natural.  \"You shouldn't put too much on the home-road thing in the playoffs,\" the former manager said. \"Unless there's something in a pitcher's head about it, he should be bringing his best for a playoff game no matter where it is.\"",

        "article": "Warning: This essay contains major spoilers from the new season of “Orange Is the New Black,” including the finale. All 13 episodes are currently available on Netflix.  Let’s face it: Playing the good girl all the time gets boring really fast.  When Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) first showed up at Litchfield Penitentiary at the start of Netflix‘s monster hit “Orange Is the New Black,” she was a scared, street-smarts-lacking pampered white girl who, when not stuck with bland story lines, was pitifully inept at managing prison life. But now, at the close of Season 3, she has evolved into a Godfather-esque crime boss within Litchfield’s walls, having become more of a crook on the inside than she ever was on the outside. And you know what? She’s scary.  For most of the new season, Piper’s attempts at being “gangsta” (her words) were a joke. As her brother Cal (Michael Chernus, who really needs to get bumped up to main cast – Cal was this season’s unsung hero) so eloquently put it, “While I’m really proud of how evil prison has made you, I think you’re overestimating your villain index. You’re still transitioning, you know. You’re not Walter White yet. You’re Walter White Ink.” Cal was right: It was hard to take Piper seriously when she was giving soapbox speeches to her fellow inmates about her burgeoning dirty-underwear company, getting a serious dressing-down on her business practices from seasoned organized-crime vet Red (Kate Mulgrew), and walking around with a white-ink tattoo that read “Trust No B—h.”  But then something happens in the season finale that turns Piper from a gangsta wannabe into a dangerous villain that is not to be crossed. Through Cal, who is managing his sister’s “Felonious Spunk” business on the outside, Piper learns that all of the money she’s made through her little enterprise is gone – stolen by her captivating new Aussie gal pal inmate, Stella Carlin (Ruby Rose). While Stella’s actions are questionable, they are understandable: Unlike rich girl Piper, Stella is alone in the world – her family is back in Australia – and when she’s released, she has no money and no one to turn to (she could’ve been lying, but we’ll believe her for now). However, what Piper does in retaliation is, to quote Carrie “Big Boo” Black (Lea DeLaria), “some stone-cold s—t.”  Days before Stella’s release, Piper hides a ton of contraband all around her frenemy’s bunk (a lighter, joints, cigarettes, a shiv made out of Jolly Ranchers, the famous screwdriver from Season 1) and alerts the guards. Stella is summarily sent to maximum-security, and if you’re familiar with “OITNB” at all (and the stories of Nicky Nichols and Miss Claudette), then you know that putting someone in “Max” is about the worst thing that can happen to any inmate at Litchfield.  Here’s the thing: Piper didn’t have to get Stella sent to Max. She did it because it’s time for a shift in her character in order for the show to remain plausible. And because anything less would have been viewed as weak (for the character). With “OITNB” heading into a fourth season (production started earlier this week), and the series displaying no signs of slowing down, it wouldn’t surprise me if there was a movement to get Piper’s sentence extended. She was only supposed to be in for less than a year and a half, and at this point, she’s creeping up on her one-year lockup anniversary.  So even though I have to agree with Alex Vause’s (Laura Prepon) observation about this revamped Piper (“I don’t like this version of you”), it is a necessary plot device to keep things interesting. But for those who really are against the idea of an Evil Piper, I think there’s also a good chance that she won’t last long. Just as Piper had reached the apex of her power trip – having the balls to say to Big Boo, “I don’t f—k around. Let the people know” – several buses full of fresh inmates began pulling up outside Litchfield in the final moments of Season 3. That means badass Piper is going to need her toughened skin and recently acquired street smarts for one of two outcomes: One, to teach the influx of prisoners who’s boss. Or, to handle her downfall in the more likely event that one of these new prisoners will knock her off her soapbox by the end of the Season 4 premiere.

        "article": "I didn’t know who Nicole Arbour was until this past weekend, when everyone I’ve ever met including my childhood dentist and your mom sent me Arbour’s Dear Fat People video, suggesting I write a rebuttal. Arbour, I quickly gathered, is a Canadian YouTuber whose popularity hinges on the supposed novelty of a woman being simultaneously opinionated, funny and conventionally attractive. (You might have come across her a month ago when her weird, slut-shaming excoriation of “Instagram models” went viral. Policing women’s bodies and self-expression under the guise of empowerment appears to be something of a signature move.) Arbour’s “funny” opinion this week, openly leveraged for attention – “Aaahhh, some people are already really mad at this video!” she chirps, four seconds in – is that fat people are lazy, disgusting, inconsiderate and smelly. It is six minutes of tired cruelty filed under “entertainment.”  The only notable thing about Arbour’s video is, perhaps, how dated it feels: while fat people still face daily harassment and systemic discrimination, body-positive activists have gotten enough of a toehold in the public consciousness that, in 2015, most mainstream, non-anonymous media outlets at least have the decency to use coded language when they shame us. Arbour’s rhetoric, by contrast, feels positively 2009: “What are you going to do, fat people? What are you going to do? You going to chase me? I can get away from you by walking at a reasonable pace.” “Fat people parking spots should be at the back of the mall parking lot. Walk to the doors and burn some calories.” “They complain, and they smell like sausages, and I don’t even think they ate sausages, that’s just their aroma. They were so fat that they’re that ‘standing sweat’ fat. Crisco was coming out of their pores.”  Broadly speaking, even comedy has moved away from fat jokes that obvious. (Who’s lazy again, by the way?) Arbour showed up late to a losing battle and declared victory. It is, frankly, embarrassing. “I’m over here putting my ass on the line,” she wrote ostentatiously on Twitter, “and being hella brave to try and change the world in a new way.” Indeed, it is “hella brave” and “new” to tell fat people to eat less and exercise more – much like the bravery of Braveheart, or the brave girl from Brave, or the weird old guy who used to come into my work when I was 17 and try to sell me pyramid scheme weight-loss pills that I’m 99% sure were tapeworm eggs mixed with Adderall. The bravery of thin people who exploit and abuse fat people for profit is truly unmatched.  I used to spend time squabbling over health and calories and insurance premiums with bad-faith internet jerks like Arbour. I’ve wasted innumerable hours and tears trying to prove my humanity as a fat person. I’ve always thought that if I could just lay my life bare enough, find language visceral enough, write evocatively enough about the ways anti-fat stigma has made my world smaller and dimmer, that it would eventually connect with people, human being to human being. But with Dear Fat People, I just can’t. It’s too pedestrian. Too lazy. Too old. It has been covered ad nauseam, and it doesn’t deserve my vulnerability.  So, instead, I want to pull back and say this, to all the Nicole Arbours of the world: You know what, Nicole? I fight for you.  Whether you like it or not, whether you realise it or not, your life is tangibly better because of fat women who live unapologetically, who wedge the gates of acceptance open wider every day. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman who wants to be more than just a body. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman whose body is scrutinised and policed every moment of your life. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman who wants to be taken seriously in comedy. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman who wants to be heard, not blamed, when she reports a sexual assault. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman who will eventually age and be told you are without value. I fight for you in your capacity as a woman vulnerable to any number of emotional and physical maladies that could, to your surprise, make you as fat as me. I fight for you in your capacity as a complex, fully formed human being with the right to autonomy over your body, even if that body gets fat.  I fight for you even when you are cruel, even when you are making money off the back of fat people’s pain, even when you refuse to fight for me. Because I know that it is hard to have a body, that insecurities make us mean, and that male approval can be a comfortable harbour while it lasts.  But you will eventually be kicked out of the club, and when that happens, you may find yourself grateful to those of us who have built a new one. Safe journey.",

        "article": "HONG KONG -- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group is expected to purchase Royal Bank of Scotland's assets in six south-east Asian markets this week, making its first major move to expand into Asia. Even though the No. 4 lender in Australia is more aggressive than its top three rivals at home, ANZ hasn't been as aggressive outside its home market until now.  The shares of Australia and New Zealand jumped 2.5% to 19.00 Australian dollars ($15.91) on Monday as it was said to soon sign its biggest overseas deal this week with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS - news - people ) for RBS's retail and commercial banking operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan. (See International Banker.)  The deal, which is estimated at about $775 million, will provide a shortcut for ANZ to transform into a regional Asian bank. The newly added Asian operations will contribute about one-fifth of revenue to ANZ by 2012, Reuters reported Monday, quoting unnamed sources.  While Australia's top three lenders including National Australia Bank ( NAB - news - people ), Westpac Banking Corp ( WBK - news - people ), and Commonwealth Bank of Australia are competing in the nearly saturated market at home, ANZ has been quietly collecting minority stakes in Chinese and Vietnamese banks over the past decade.  To prepare for a bigger move, ANZ raised 2.5 billion Australian dollars ($2.1 billion) with a massive placement in late May. Since then, market speculation has been building up that ANZ would likely purchase RBS's Asian assets.  Nevertheless, ANZ won't acquire RBS's prime businesses in India and China in the potential deal because it would be too difficult for a new overseas player to enter these two fast-growing but complicated emerging markets without licenses, the source told Reuters.  ANZ refused to comment on the report. An RBS spokesperson in Hong Kong told Forbes.com, We are well advanced with the sale process, however due to regulatory constraints and the confidentiality of the process we will not be commenting on any individual bidders or elements of the transaction process until its completion. In the meantime, it is business as usual at our branches and offices and RBS is committed to its customers and employees to ensure smooth transition of the businesses to the new owners once the transaction is announced.\"  The financially strained RBS has put its entire Asian network for sale, hoping to tap about $2 billion in capital to exit Asia and rescue its ailing business at home. A bunch of aggressive takeover bids made Scotland's largest lending group almost go under amid the present financial turmoil. In its most controversial deal, RBS teamed up with Belgian partner Fortis ( FORSY.PK - news - people ), and Spanish counterpart Banco Santander to acquire Dutch Bank ABN AMRO for a total of 49 billion pounds in October 2007.  Drained by the ABN deal and other overseas expansion, RBS thus had to raise 12 billion pounds in April 2008 to shore up its balance sheet and to offset the writedown on investment loss.  After a series of capital injections from the British government's plan to rescue the country's financial sector, RBS is now 70.3% held by British Treasury.  Emerging market veteran Standard Chartered ( SCBEF.PK - news - people ) was said to be in running with RBS for its assets in China, India and Malaysia.  Thomson Reuters contributed to this article.",

        "article": "It’s unfair to make stereotypes, but girls do tend to mature faster than boys. (Getty)  Do girls mature faster than boys? Spend a day at any middle school and you might find this to be true. In the science room, the girls are carefully and neatly writing up their hypotheses in their manuals, while the boys are melting crayons on the Bunsen burner. At recess the boys are making fart jokes while the girls are talking about who they want to kiss at the dance. Open up some lockers: The girls’ are carefully decorated with photographs and wrapping paper while a mess of books and trash topples out of the boys’.  Yes, these are gross generalizations and entirely unfair sweeping stereotypes. Yes, there are many, many exceptions. The brightest, most together, responsible kid in my kindergarten class was a boy and as a result he skipped first grade and went on to be one of the smartest kids in California when he graduated from high school.  But in general girls seem to get their acts together a little earlier than boys and now science has found that girls brains can develop up to 10 years earlier than boys, according to the Telegraph. This might explain “why girls mature faster in certain cognitive and emotional areas than males during childhood and adolescence,” according to Psychology Today.  While studying how the brain stores information, a group of researchers at England’s Newcastle University stumbled upon evidence showing that girls’ brains start to work more efficiently at a younger age than boys’. They found that the restructuring that happens in children’s brains occurs much earlier in girls than in boys. The brain actually weeds out information and focuses on what’s most important. Connections in the brain that don’t get regularly used are dropped and those connections that get used the most are nourished and reenforced. This all happens as early as 10 years old for girls and between 15 and 20 for boys.  For this small study published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, the brains of 121 people, ages 4 to 40, were scanned using MRIs and researchers graphed the ebb and flow of neural connections, according to Time.com.  “Completely by accident we found there is a difference between boys and girls in terms of development,” Dr Marcus Kaiser told the Telegraph.  “Previous studies have shown that the brain does a lot of re-organising during puberty, there is greater activity during this time, “ said Dr Kaiser.  “But it was rather unexpected to find that these changes were starting much earlier in girls in comparison with boys.”",

Kennedy once noted, the Chinese word for \"crisis\" is composed of the characters for \"danger\" and \"opportunity.\" So characteristically, amid the hand-wringing at CES about the show's decreased relevance, a handful of Chinese brands saw a big opportunity.  In fact, the emergence of several Chinese brands as wannabe major players became one of the central narratives of the show. Typically at CES, Chinese tech brands are relegated to the International Pavilion rather than the show proper.  This year, though, there were at least five brands from China — Hisense, ZTE, TCL, Huawei and Haier — that took the main stage or at least got treated seriously by the press.  Next up: Convincing U.S. consumers that Chinese brands equal high quality. Despite the fact that most U.S. electronics are actually manufactured in China these days, U.S. consumers still view Chinese brands on a lower plane, says Hayes Roth, CMO of Landor Associates, a branding consultancy. However, those beliefs can change.  Roth pointed out that Japanese brands Sony and Panasonic set the precedent for changing U.S. mindsets in the 1960s. Buoyed by a simultaneous influx of Japanese auto brands, the U.S. public slowly began to have a different view of \"Made in Japan,\" Roth says. \"The Japanese got around that by reinventing quality control,\" Roth says. \"They became the gold standard.\" A generation later, South Korean brands LG, Hyundai, Kia and Samsung convinced U.S. consumers that Korean goods could go toe-to-toe with Japanese products.  Samsung, in particular, likely provides an aspirational road map for Chinese brands. In 2012, the brand successfully battled the perception that it was an Apple copycat with a slew of innovative, quality products. Samsung is now the top producer of cell phones in the world and its smartphones outsell Apple's by a roughly two-to-one margin.  However, success for the following brands is far from a given. Roth notes for instance that, despite its lead in the marketplace, the China-based Lenovo \"hasn't become a dominant brand.\" In the footwear category, Li-Neng, known as the Nike of China, is still pretty obscure in the U.S., even though it's earned high-profile U.S. endorsers like Dwyane Wade. Another cautionary tale is HTC, the Taiwanese telecom brand whose quick ascendance in the U.S. has been followed by an equally swift collapse.  Despite the odds, the following Chinese brands saw CES as their springboard for a breakout 2013:  Hisense has been established in the U.S. since 2001 and makes TVs, refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners, among other products. Since 2007, it has achieved 30% annual growth. In 2012, the company posted $2 billion in sales. By 2015, it aims to achieve a total of $5 billion in sales. At CES, Hisense got attention by showing off a 110-inch ultra HD TV, a Smart TV controlled by gestures and voice and a glasses-free 3D TV. The company also makes Android phones.  ZTE has had a U.S. presence since 1995. The company manufactures phones for Verizon, among others, but plans to make a bigger name for itself in 2013 with a Firefox OS-based smartphone. ZTE plans to release the device in Europe — and possibly the U.S. — this year. \"They're really expanding their range and their portfolio,\"  TCL is the world's fourth-largest TV producer after Samsung, LG and Sony. At CES, TCL displayed an Android-based TV called Ice Screen that includes Frequency, a video curation app that lets you subscribe to BBC, CNN and other channels.  Huawei sought to stand out from the pack at CES with the Ascend P1 S, which is billed as the \"world's slimmest smartphone\" at 6.68 mm and the Ascend D2 smartphone, which sports a 6.2-inch screen.  Haier, another conglomerate that makes everything from mobile phones to washing machines, showcased a vision-control system for TVs at CES that lets you adjust the volume and browse a news feed with your eyes.

        "article": "If you dig deep enough into the Earth’s climate change archives, you hear about the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM. And then you get scared.  This is a time period, about 56 million years ago, when something mysterious happened — there are many ideas as to what — that suddenly caused concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to spike, far higher than they are right now. The planet proceeded to warm rapidly, at least in geologic terms, and major die-offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans.  The cause of the PETM has been widely debated. Some think it was an explosion of carbon from thawing Arctic permafrost. Some think there was a huge release of subsea methane that somehow made its way to the atmosphere — and that the series of events might have been kickstarted by major volcanic eruptions.  In any case, the result was a hothouse world from pole to pole, some 5 degrees Celsius warmer overall. But now, new research suggests, even the drama of the PETM falls short of our current period, in at least one key respect: We’re putting carbon into the atmosphere at an even faster rate than happened back then.  This high-resolution animation shows carbon dioxide emitted from fires and megacities over a five day period in June 2006. The model is based on real emission data so that scientists can observe how the greenhouse gas behaves once it has been emitted. (Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center)  Such is the result of a new study in Nature Geoscience, led by Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and colleagues from the University of Bristol in the UK and the University of California-Riverside.  “If you look over the entire Cenozoic, the last 66 million years, the only event that we know of at the moment, that has a massive carbon release, and happens over a relatively short period of time, is the PETM,” says Zeebe. “We actually have to go back to relatively old periods, because in the more recent past, we don’t see anything comparable to what humans are currently doing.”  That’s why this time period is so crucial to study — as a possible window on our own.  There’s no doubt that a lot of carbon — about as much as contained the fossil fuel reserves that humans have either already burned, or could still burn, combined — made its way into the atmosphere during the PETM. The result was a major warming event that lasted over 100,000 years. But precisely how rapidly the emissions occurred is another matter.  “If anthropogenic emissions rates have no analogue in Earth’s recent history, then unforeseeable future responses of the climate system are possible,” the authors write.  To examine what happened in the PETM, the researchers used a deep ocean core of sediment from off the coast of New Jersey. The goal was to determine the ratios between different isotopes, or slightly different elemental forms, of carbon and oxygen, in the sediments during the PETM.  The relationship between the two lets researchers determine how atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, as reflected in the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13, in turn influenced temperatures (which can be inferred based on oxygen isotopes in the ocean).  “In terms of these two systems, the first shows us when the carbon went into the system, and the second tells us when the climate responded,” says Zeebe.  It turns out that there is a lag time between massive pulses of carbon in the atmosphere and subsequent warming, because the oceans have a large thermal inertia. Therefore, a large lag would indicate a greater carbon release, whereas the lack of one actually means that carbon dioxide came out more slowly.  The geologic evidence from the new core did not show a lag, the new study reports. That means, the authors estimate, that while a gigantic volume of carbon entered the atmosphere during the PETM — between 2,000 and 4,500 billion tons — it played out over some 4,000 years. So only about 1 billion tons of carbon were emitted per year. In contrast, humans are now emitting about 10 billion tons annually — changing the planet much more rapidly.  “The anthropogenic release outpaces carbon release during the most extreme global warming event of the past 66 million years, by at least an order of magnitude,” writes Peter Stassen, an Earth and environmental scientist at KU Leuven, in Belgium, in an accompanying commentary on the new study.  The analogy between the PETM and the present, then, is less than perfect — and our own era may be worse in key ways. “The two main conclusions is that ocean acidification will be more severe, ecosystems may be hit harder because of the rate” of carbon release, says Zeebe.  And not only have we only begun to see the changes that will result from current warming, but there may be other changes that lack any ancient parallel, because of the current rate of change.  “Given that the current rate of carbon release is unprecedented throughout the Cenozoic, we have effectively entered an era of a no-analogue state, which represents a fundamental challenge to constraining future climate projections,” the study concludes.

        "article": "LAHORE, Pakistan — “I used to feel my life was too straight, too linear.”  The speaker was Junaid Hafeez, a young poet and Fulbright scholar from the south of Pakistan, telling a radio show host in 2011 why he had given up studying medicine for a life in literature. Today, he is in jail on a blasphemy charge that carries the death penalty, and is mourning the lawyer who was murdered earlier this month for defending him.  Before his arrest, Hafeez was teaching in the English Department at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, a city in Punjab Province close to where he grew up. His personal charisma and liberal views had won him a following among students, as well as the envious attention of faculty members.  One day in 2013, a student affiliated with Islami Jamiat Talaba, a wing of the hard-line Jamaat-i-Islami party, accused Hafeez of insulting the Prophet Muhammad on Facebook. The student had no evidence, but no evidence was needed.  Hard-line students soon held a protest crying out for Hafeez’s execution. University administrators backed away. The police registered a case for blasphemy against Hafeez. They did not ask cybercrime specialists to investigate the accusation, relying instead on a fatwa issued by a seminary.  For months Hafeez’s father tried to find a lawyer. Finally he petitioned Rashid Rehman, the 53-year-old special coordinator for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in Multan. A legal expert with 20 years of activism, Rehman was known as a go-to lawyer for hopeless causes. Despite the danger, he agreed to take Hafeez’s case. Defending a man accused of blasphemy, Rehman told a reporter in April, was like “walking into the jaws of death.”  Those jaws have been open wide since the 1980s, when the military dictator Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq updated a set of colonial laws that criminalized “insulting the religion of any class of persons.” The original laws were devised in the late 19th century by a paternalistic British government trying to keep its multifaith subjects from fighting one another. Those laws were worded generally, and prescribed fines and, at most, two-year prison terms.  General Zia’s amendments particularized the insults and tailored the provisions to favor a stringent Sunni strain of Islam. They criminalized the desecration of the Quran, any defiling of the name of the Prophet Muhammad, and disrespectful remarks about his companions — a jab at Pakistan’s Shiite minorities, who dispute the outcome of the succession struggle that followed the Prophet’s death. Moreover, any attempt by members of the outlawed Ahmadi sect to refer to themselves as Muslims was criminalized. Punishments were upgraded: Blasphemers could be executed or jailed for life.  General Zia died in an air crash in 1988, but his legacy remains. It includes the empowerment of theological figures in every stratum of life — from clerics and televangelists to fanatical academics and Shariah judges — all aided in their righteous endeavors by a legislature that remains intractably Zia-ist.  The blasphemy laws are part of this package. For decades they had been rarely used, with only a handful of cases before the mid-1980s. But General Zia’s amendments opened the floodgates: More than a thousand cases have been reported since then, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Just last week the Punjabi police, prompted by a Sunni extremist, brought blasphemy charges against 68 lawyers.  The blasphemy laws can serve just about anyone with a dark design — an angry relative, an envious colleague, a neighbor with his eye on your property. But the greatest beneficiary has been the professional Islamists, who specialize in their application to encroach on both state and society.  I got a sense of this in August 2009 when I visited the torched Christian neighborhood of Gojra, a small city in the heart of Pakistan. A Muslim peasant had spread a rumor that Christian neighbors had desecrated a Quran, and it degenerated into a riot after clerics riled up Muslims with hysterical broadcasts from the loudspeakers of mosques. When the police tried to stop the mullahs, they quoted the blasphemy laws and threatened to turn the mob against the authorities for “protecting the blasphemers.” Some 60 Christian houses were set on fire and eight Christians killed.  The Islamists would have us think that all believers are susceptible to spontaneous eruptions of violence when their religion is offended. But the reality, as documented by a government report on the Gojra incident, is more treacherous and tragic. A blasphemy charge, once taken up by a religious activist, can legitimate myriad other interests, from petty personal needs to large political plans, and create an exhilarating free-for-all atmosphere. The Gojra rioters included the constituents of the local opposition politician, peasants and day-laborers from neighboring areas who joined in the looting and armed members of the now-banned Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.  Pakistan’s Islamist groups have little incentive to reform the blasphemy laws. They have even expanded the understanding of blasphemy so that it now includes any criticism of the laws themselves. This has been achieved by targeting high-profile dissenters, like Salmaan Taseer, a governor of Punjab province, and Shahbaz Bhatti, a federal minister for minorities, who were both assassinated in 2011.  And then, just two weeks ago, there was the murder of Rashid Rehman.  They closed in on him as mafias do, from all sides. First there were encoded warnings in Urdu newspapers, describing a lawyer who was out to “hurt himself.” Then there was a press conference in Multan at which a group of stern-faced clerics accused Rehman of trying to make an international issue of the Hafeez case. In April, during Hafeez’s trial, three lawyers for the prosecution told Rehman in front of the judge that by the next hearing he “would not exist.”  Rehman’s colleagues at the human rights commission urged the government to provide him with security. They got no help. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party has a history of placating extremist groups, like the Pakistani Taliban, to gain political mileage.  On the night of May 7, two young men walked into Rehman’s office near the district courts in Multan, shot him dead in front of his colleagues, and fled into the night. The next morning, almost every newspaper in Pakistan described them as “unidentified individuals.” But what killed Rehman can be identified: It was violent zealotry, aided and abetted by the state.

A touchscreen ordering system at Bolt Burgers (Maura Judkis)  You can order food without having a single interaction with another human being, which, for millennials who prefer texting and online ordering through Seamless to picking up the phone, is a major plus.  Michael Davidson, Joe Spinelli and other partners at Bolt Burgers are banking on it. When the 3,200-square-foot restaurant opens by Thanksgiving at 1010 Massachusetts Ave. NW, they'll have put more than 18 months into perfecting the computer systems behind Bolt, a concept they plan to franchise.  There are several ways to order a Bolt burger, and one of them can be done from your office. An online pre-ordering system will allow customers to order in advance for both take-out and dine-in: Give the server your order number when you arrive and, if all goes according to plan, your food will be at your seat within 10 minutes.  If you haven't pre-ordered, a server will present you with a table number if you plan to dine in. Use that to place your order at one of the touchscreen kiosks, or through the touchscreen tablet at your seat.  Bolt Burger touchscreen ordering system (Maura Judkis)  As for the burgers, Bolt offers beef, turkey, chicken and veggie options, but it's really throwing its muscle behind toppings. To create your own Bolt Burger ($6.99 and up) you're presented with 25 potential toppings, including truffle pecorino cheese, pancetta and fancy relishes. Before it's grilled, each burger can be dusted in one of four spice blends custom-mixed for the company.  There's also a menu of signature Bolt Burgers. Chef Troy Clayton's most excited about one called the \"Mr. Truffleupagus,\" a burger with truffle pecorino, grilled field mushrooms and roasted shallots with sweet garlic relish. \"Everybody in the burger business has a good burger,\" said Spinelli, \"so this is what distinguishes us from everybody else.\"  Special spice rubs created just for Bolt Burgers (Maura Judkis)  One of the technological centerpieces of Bolt Burgers is a no-flip burger grill. The device can cook a six-ounce burger in exactly three minutes, to the exact same level of doneness every time. It can make 1,200 burgers an hour. \"I think it's fantastic,\" said Clayton. \"I have the confidence that the guy at the grill will hit a button and get a perfect burger every time.\"  Special double-sided burger grills at Bolt Burgers (Maura Judkis)  The restaurant's opening, in approximately three weeks, will depend on getting all of its systems up and running. \"There's a lot of complicated electronics that have to work,\" Davidson said. When Bolt opens, it will seat about 80 people indoors and about 40 on the patio. It's located in an area near the D.C. convention center that doesn't yet have much competition -- until the restaurants in the new Marriott Marquis open, at least -- but is at the intersection of daytime workers, evening residents and out-of-town guests. And the 16-foot projection of their logo makes the restaurant impossible for drivers coming down Massachusetts Avenue to miss.  \"Now we just need curbside service,\" joked Davidson, looking out the window at the cars stuck in traffic. They'd probably figure out a way to automate that, too.  Bolt Burgers, 1010 Massachusetts Ave. NW. Opening late November.",

        "article": "(RIO DE JANEIRO) — Aline Silva has had the dengue fever twice, and she’s not taking any chances with the Zika virus.  Silva is a Brazilian wrestler who hopes to win an Olympic medal in just over six months in Rio de Janeiro. At a test event on Sunday for the games — at a venue in Rio’s new Olympic Park — she wasn’t alone in being concerned.  Several non-Brazilian athletes talked about slathering on mosquito repellent, staying in their hotel rooms and away from the water and the beaches in order to avoid mosquitoes.  Brazil is an epicenter of the rapidly spreading Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that Brazilian scientists say is linked to a rare birth defect.  The growing international health emergency around Zika could scare athletes and fans from coming to South America’s first Olympics as organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of visitors.  “For me it’s very worrying,” said Silva, who said she applies repellent about every 90 minutes when she’s away from home.  “Really, the biggest problem is in training and competing — when I can’t use it (repellent),” she said. “I have had dengue twice, so I am aware about all of this. Maybe I am more worried than most.”  Asked if other Brazilian athletes were concerned about Zika, Silva replied: “Yes, of course.”  American wrestler Adeline Gray, a three-time world champion who will be an Olympic favorite for gold, raised the issue of Zika’s link to birth defects and cases of babies being born with unusually small heads and possible brain damage.  “I think if I was planning to have a child next month, I would be extremely uneasy about this,” said Gray, who competes in the 75-kilogram class. “Maybe that would have changed my decision (to come here).”  Gray said her coaches have banned her from going swimming in Brazil during her short stay.  “Unfortunately we’re not spending too much time outside. We’re wearing long sleeves, long pants and just making sure we have on as much bug spray as we can.”  Gray said she’s trying to avoid the distraction. As several reporters kept asking her questions, she politely stepped away to watch an on-going match at the new Carioca Arena 1.  “This anxiety has to kind of subside so you can focus on what you are doing,” she said. “If you are worried about that in the back of your mind, then you’re not doing your job well enough.”  Japan coach Shigeo Kinase gave similar advice to his wrestlers about staying indoors.  “We are trying not to leave the hotel too often,” he said. “If my athletes go out shopping, I go with them.”  Rio organizers have been scouring Olympics venues daily for two weeks, looking for standing water where mosquitoes breed. Rio spokesman Mario Andrada said the inspections would continue daily until the games open on Aug. 5. That will be in Brazil’s winter when it’s cooler, drier and the mosquito population is smaller.  Andrada emphasized that no one is publicly talking about cancelling or postponing the games.  “This has never been mentioned. No way,” Andrada said. “It’s impossible to do that. There is no reason to do that.”  SNTV producer Filipe de Almeida contributed to this report.",

Rows of cylindrical tanks, each about 7 feet tall, contain brightly colored liquids in green, yellow, and orange. If it was a Hollywood set, the next mutant nemesis of Iron Man or Spiderman might burst forth at any moment.  But this is the hatchery at Island Creek Oyster Farm in Duxbury, so the only thing growing in those giant test tubes is algae. Pearson, a marine biologist and the hatchery manager, monitors each of the 18 tanks closely. Algae feeds the farm’s baby oysters — no bigger than grains of sand at this stage — and is one of the first keys to a business that expects to harvest and sell about 6 million oysters this year.  “Every single one has a different nutritional value,” Pearson said of the algae varieties in her charge. “I make a combination every day so the oysters have a variety of nutrients in their diet.”  The miniature shellfish in the hatchery will be roughly the size of a half-dollar by summer’s end. That’s when farm manager Gardner Loring and his crew will scatter them over six acres of seabed in Duxbury Bay. There the young oysters will grow through the fall and winter, until they are big enough to eat.  Only half of them will make it.  Last year’s survivors are ready for seafood platters now. When the tide goes out and the water is shallow enough to wade through, the oysters can be plucked by hand. The rest of the time, Loring drags a net behind an outboard motorboat to collect them. In less than 10 minutes, the net traps enough oysters to fill three crates, each weighing 50 pounds.  Loring hauls in 8,000 to 10,000 oysters per day. Despite circling the same area, he won’t have to move anytime soon.  “I could drag this spot for three weeks,” he said.  With crates stacked high, Loring doesn’t head for shore; he motors to a floating dock with a weathered shelter the size of a backyard shed. Farm hands call it the Oysterplex. Here, Mark Bouthillier, Billy Balaschi, and Andy Puopolo sort the catch by size.  A three-inch measuring ring sits on a shelf in one corner. It doesn’t get much use.  “We’ve been doing this for a while,” said Puopolo. “We go mostly by eye.”  Debee Tlumacki for the Boston Globe  Gardner Loring pulled in a net loaded with oysters.

        "article": "Mr. Mashal said that 90 percent of the suicide bombers were from Pakistan. But Afghans often point fingers at Pakistan and accuse it of responsibility for much of the violence that happens here.  NATO military officials said they had little information about the backgrounds of suicide bombers in Afghanistan. While many come from the Pakistani tribal areas, a number of them are of Afghan origin, making it murky whether they should be considered Pakistani or Afghan; both groups speak Pashto and have an identical culture.  The Afghan intelligence directorate presented would-bombers in handcuffs at the news conference, all showing markedly different emotions. All of them had been told that if they became suicide bombers they would go to heaven and that the people they were killing, even the Afghans, were infidels.  A 14-year-old Pakistani boy, Akhtar Nawaz, who had only a faint fuzz on his upper lip, spoke softly, saying that he had been pressured into attempting a suicide bombing while he was attending a madrasa in Miram Shah.  “A man named Gul Agha met me after school and he said, ‘You will do an attack where you sacrifice yourself.’ I told him, ‘No, I don’t want to do a martyrdom attack,’ ” Akhtar said. “Then he started forcing me. He said infidels have come to Afghanistan and you need to fight them and if you don’t, we will harm you.”  They trained him for about six weeks, teaching him to shoot, and then gave him an explosive vest and told him to go across the Afghan border, kill two soldiers and then detonate the vest when he was inside the Afghan Army base, he said. Afghan soldiers saw him crossing and caught him.  The second would-be suicide bomber was Ghami, a 19-year-old shopkeeper from Kandahar, who was recruited first to fight American soldiers in the Arghandab District, but was persuaded to become a suicide bomber by a recruiter named Mirwais who promised him that he would go to heaven, Ghami said.  “Mirwais was telling me about heaven and the benefits of heaven and the way he was telling me about it, it was as if he had the keys to heaven,” he said. “He was saying, ‘Heaven is right near you. All you need to do is to go ahead and sacrifice yourself.’ ”  Worried that Ghami might drift away, Mirwais added that he would pay his family 500,000 Pakistani rupees, or about $5,800. He smiled as he spoke and said that he was being treated well and that the food was very good in the intelligence department’s prison. The third would-be bomber was also from Pakistan. He said that he, too, had been told that it was holy to kill Afghans and that when he arrived in Laghman Province in eastern Afghanistan he was surprised to see people praying because he had thought they were all infidels.

        "article": "They know the drill in Seattle by now. Around 5pm on Sunday evening (1am Monday GMT) the bars around Pioneer Square will begin to empty, glasses flung down before punters convene inside Occidental Park. By the time they set off they will number a couple of thousand, possibly more. It is not a long journey, half a mile maybe, but the march is sufficient to set the heart racing and by the time they enter their section in the south stand of CenturyLink Field, members of Seattle Sounders’ Emerald City Supporters group (ECS) will be warmed for a non-negotiable 90 minutes’ vocal support . Before that, they will almost certainly unfurl one of the flag-based “Tifo” displays for which they have achieved international renown. Upwards of 55,000 others will share the spectacle and after all that, if recent form is much to go by, the Sounders will win.  There is something metronomic about all this, but a little more edge comes into play now. Win sufficiently against LA Galaxy in the Major League Soccer Western Championship, second leg – they are 1-0 down from the first – and a Sounders team spearheaded by Obafemi Martins and Clint Dempsey will reach their first MLS Cup final. It is the biggest domestic prize and Seattle, mathematically the best team in either MLS Conference this season, will be heartened they defeated their opponents 2-0 on home turf five weeks ago.  LA Galaxy are old hands – four MLS Cups tell that story – and as well-worn a name as the league has had. The Sounders, created in 2008 and remodelling a famous name from the past, are 13 years younger and that deficit has matched their image: fresh, exciting, liberal but, on the pitch, short of maturity.  “If you had told me in late 2007, when we first acquired the MLS team, that we would be where we are today I would not have believed you,” Adrian Hanauer, the Sounders’ general manager and minority owner, tells the Observer. “To think that we’d have around 36,000 season ticket holders and average 44,000 fans a game, and that we would become such a ubiquitous part of the culture and community – we’ve exceeded our expectations.”  The Sounders are succeeding where so many fail. Attendances were expected to dip below the 32,253 who watched the reincarnation’s first MLS game, against New York Red Bulls, in March 2009, once the novelty had waned. A levelling-out to around 12,000 was allowed for.  The extent to which they first held up and then swelled – their average attendance is 27th in the world this year – may have caused surprise in the boardroom but the perfect mechanism to harness the interest already existed.  An official members’ association, the Seattle Sounders FC Alliance, was allowed in 2012 to vote for the club’s general manager. It can do so again in 2016. This democratic approach extends to numerous issues within the club, and season ticket holders join the Alliance for free. There is no equivalent in MLS; Barcelona and Real Madrid are obvious inspirations.  “By creating this democracy, we tap into a unique psyche within our north-west demographic and fanbase,” says Hanauer. “We do have a very progressive, well-educated, counter-cultural city and the interaction we’ve put into place identifies with that. People get it, they appreciate it and it makes them that bit more engaged.”  It is a happy camp and there is a sense that the Sounders have struck upon something residual in a multicultural city whose first attempt at a professional club rode the short-lived NASL wave adeptly enough during the 1970s. The base feels solid and the club has bigger designs.  “We are striving to be among the top clubs in the world, but that will take time,” says Hanauer. “A modest first step would be to win the Concacaf Champions League and qualify for the Fifa Club World Cup. That would allow us to argue that we’re one of the top clubs in the Americas, and, to some degree, globally.  “Off the pitch, we feel as if we are as strong as many of the world’s best and we want to be known as the club with the most passionate fanbase, the best matchday experience and the best value.”  Now things must come together on the field and there is a feeling among the fans that, after a degree of frustration with the long-serving coach Sigi Schmid in recent years, the Sounders are amassing a side worthy of their dynamic image.  “There have been some magical moments watching Dempsey and Martins together this season,” says Aaron Reed, co-president of ECS. “Perhaps, for the first time, Sigi has everything he wants – people playing creatively up top, a solid midfield. It’s the closest to a pure team that he’s put together.”  That team will be tested in January if DeAndre Yedlin, the right-back, makes his agreed move to Tottenham Hotspur. In the shorter term, they have had to contend with storms that rinsed any post-Thanksgiving sluggishness and cut short Friday’s training. Schmid wondered whether LA Galaxy would enjoy the non-Californian conditions, but real home advantage will lie in the atmosphere created inside CenturyLink Field.  Although Reed and ECS keep quiet, it is a fair bet this will include a painstakingly arranged Tifo. As Hanauer, who is “paranoid” about maintaining the club’s momentum, watches he may be reflect on the progress since his first involvement with a Sounders team. In 2002, he took over the first remake of the NASL side as it played out time in the United Soccer Leagues to small crowds. “When I was a small boy I went to all the Sounders’ games in the NASL and there was the same kind of vibe in the community. Then it went away for 25 years and I wasn’t sure that we would ever get it back. Seeing what we have now feels a bit like deja vu.”  Major League Soccer is divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western, and the top five teams at the end of the 34-game regular season in each qualify for the playoffs. The fourth and fifth-placed teams play each other in a one-off game. The winners progress to the conference semi-finals.These are two-legged matches, as is each conference final. In the Western final, LA Galaxy lead 1-0 Seattle Sounders after the first leg; in the Eastern, New England Revolution hold a 2-1 margin over New York Red Bulls. Away goals count after 90 minutes of the second leg but not in extra time, and if the teams are still level after 120 minutes, there is a penalty shootout. The winners of the conference finals then play each other on 7 December at a venue still to be decided, to be crowned MLS champions.",

        "article": "And so, we reach the end of the World Cup.  It's Germany and Argentina for the Cup — a final matchup many saw coming, but one with rich story lines waiting to play out. Will Germany's young squad, which exploded onto the international stage in the 2010 World Cup, prove how much they've grown? Or will Argentina's Lionel Messi finally clinch the world-champion title that has eluded him so far, silencing all who continue to doubt him as the greatest soccer player ever to grace the pitch?  This will be the third time Germany and Argentina have met in the World Cup finals: first in 1986 and then the following Cup in 1990. Argentina bested West Germany in 1986, and West Germany took back the title in 1990 — a match that many soccer fans do not look back on fondly.  Outside of final matches, Germany has an overall 3-0-1 record against the Argentinians, with a recent 4-0 victory at the 2010 World Cup.  On Sunday, the two nations will be able to settle the final score.  Germany's lineup is scary, especially after the team displayed the crazy potential of its midfield talent against Brazil on Tuesday.  We discussed how Germany needed time to get used to its \"new\" lineup featuring captain Philipp Lahm's return to right-back, after a somewhat shaky showing in the team's quarterfinal match against France.  Although Germany's semifinal match against Brazil isn't the perfect indicator of the former's lineup (because Brazil had all but thrown in the towel by the third or fourth goal), Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos' midfield performance in the game proves how much the German squad is starting to gel.  Until the match against France, Khedira and the other world-class component to Germany's new midfield lineup, Bastian Schweinsteiger, never played a full game together. Instead, they were subbed out for each other, as both were coming off injuries. Throughout group stages, Lahm had to play out of his normal position — something he enjoyed, as the player has said he currently feels more like a defensive midfielder rather than a right-back (and plays the midfield position at Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga).  Lahm is a world-class right-back through and through, and his return to the position in Germany's match against France improved one of the former's glaring weaknesses during the group stages: their defensive third.  Maybe this was head coach Joachim Löw's entire plan from the start: Run a lineup in which Lahm plays a defensive midfield position to allow both Khedira and Schweinsteiger time to rest up before unleashing the true midfield potential of both alongside Kroos — ultimately devastating Brazil.  Playing Lahm out of position could also likely have been a misguided plan by Löw, which only ended because the latter ran out of options to place in the right-back position. Playing his talent out of position is something Löw has been doing all tournament, especially with Özil — a player who thrives as an attacking midfield, but has been playing on the left wing. That's not to say he's playing poorly; however, Özil's unfamiliarity with a much more defense-oriented strategy and his position on the field has left him making far fewer plays than expected.  Özil has been a magnet for critics throughout the World Cup, who call him lazy and unproductive on the field. But coaches and players love Özil because he isn't flashy: He's a selfless player who prefers to set up his teammates with impeccably delivered passes. Özil works subtly on the field to draw multiple defenders (who are aware of his playmaking ability), creating space and chances for his teammates to score. Check out his skills in this World Cup highlight reel created by Reddit user 1mdelightful:  Özil has had some less-than-stellar performances in the tournament, but he's essential to his team — just like Kroos, Khedira, Lahm and Schweinsteiger, among others. There's a reason why Germany's nickname is the simple Die Mannschaft or \"The Team.\" Germany's starting lineup is feared because everyone knows their role on the team in order to win for the team.  The German national team celebrates Miroslav Klose's (11) record-breaking second goal for Germany during the World Cup semifinal soccer match between Brazil and Germany at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte, Brazil on July 8, 2014. Klose's goal made him the record holder for most World Cup goals scored at 16.  However, Germany's crushing defeat of Brazil should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, the team executed well and looked in sync, but there were many examples of Germany slowing down during the World Cup — like it did against Algeria in the round of 16 or against Ghana in group stages.  Argentina is certainly aware of this potentially fatal flaw, especially as the team tries to work out the kinks of its often shaky team play.  Netherlands' Ron Vlaar, bottom, tackles Argentina's Lionel Messi during the World Cup semifinal soccer match between the Netherlands and Argentina at the Itaquerao Stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil on July 9, 2014.  The hard truth is that Messi carried Argentina out of the group stages, as soccer gods tend to do.  Since then, different players on the team have shined brilliantly outside of the shadow cast by Messi's consistent genius — but at different times and never together as a coherent squad. Although Messi continues to deliver the same quality of play, much of it has been in a supportive role to these players.  In the early stages of the knockout round, Angel di Maria lit up the field, and continued to do so until he suffered a thigh injury against Belgium in the quarterfinals. Di Maria sat out of the semifinal match against the Netherlands on Wednesday, and has reportedly been training \"lightly\" with the hopes of being well enough to play in the final match on Sunday.  In the quarterfinals against Belgium, Gonzalo Higuian took control of the game, and showed why he's a feared poacher in the box.  In the semifinals, we saw a great defensive showing by Javier Mascherano who managed to continuously shut down the Netherlands' Arjen Robben. In the offense, there were some great attacks led by Ezequiel Lavezzi, proving that the Argentinian squad is slowly learning how to fire on all cylinders.  \"Messitina\" might have been popular during the group stages — and the player still continues to perform while drawing a lot of defensive attention — but Argentina is full of its own stars who demonstrated that they can carry their team just as much as Messi can. If di Maria recovers, expect him and Messi to set up plays for Lavezzi, Higuian and possibly Sergio Agüero, while Mascherano and Sergio Romero control Argentina's solid defensive line.  However, every single player will have to show up as one collective force on Sunday if Argentina wants to challenge the strong, team-oriented Germany. Argentina can do it.  Argentina's Lionel Messi, left, is carried by his teammates Argentina's Angel di Maria (7) and Argentina's Marcos Rojo after scoring the first goal during the Group F World Cup soccer match between Nigeria and Argentina at the Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre, Brazil on June 25, 2014.  Still, with all this talk about the importance of \"teams,\" one brilliant demigod of a man is still capable of carrying his team to a World Cup win. This is the finals, after all — anything is possible. It's just much easier to clinch the title as a team.  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.",

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman, Darrell Issa, has led the way into the Congressional probe of this program. He joins us live tonight from Capitol Hill. Congressman, thanks for being here. Your first assessment of this report today.  REP. DARRELL ISSA, (R-CA) HOUSE OVERSIGHT/GOVT REFORM CHMN: It's a good report. There were a few things they weren't able to get to, and they're still looking for them, including White House officials who were briefed but not made available to the I.G. But overall, what they did was they outlined what went wrong at ATF, what went wrong in Phoenix, and then went up the chain to show what went wrong all the way to the very top of Justice.  BAIER: You mentioned the top. You have Jason Weinstein, deputy assistant attorney general who resigned today, but that's where it stops. It does not go beyond that. This does directly tie to the death of Brian Terry, the patrol agent. Would you want it to go further?  ISSA: Well, certainly, the cover-up goes further. I was with the Terry family in a rural area called Bisbee, Arizona, for the naming of the Brian A. Terry border patrol station yesterday. They want the answers and they want everyone held accountable for the initial failure, but they also want answers on the cover-up where for ten months the American people were told that they don't let guns walk.  Those false statements came from Justice all the way to the very top, including Lanny Breuer, and ultimately, Eric Holder.  BAIER: Eric Holder, the attorney general released a statement, as you know, today. In part it said this, \"It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations -- accusations that turned out to be without foundation, that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion.\"  \"I hope today's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed.\" Your reaction to that sir?  ISSA: My reaction is, one of the critical people in his office required to brief him, handpicked by him, resigned today, and it's still only the tip of the iceberg. The fact is that just because you're not convicted doesn't mean you're vindicated.  Attorney General Holder didn't ask the questions, didn't read the memos, and up and down the chain, the people that worked for him, the political appointees responsible to him failed to do their job, including denying reading wiretaps that they were responsible for signing. There's no question there needs to be real reform at Justice.  That's something that, I think, in the wake of Brian Terry's murder, we owe it to the family to fix it, to fix the system, and in fact, to hold people responsible. Eric Holder didn't do his job, didn't care enough to even call the family, and today -- today, finally, one of the people that should have been gone a year-and-a-half ago resigned, but only after the I.G. pointed specifically to him.  But he also pointed to others and pointed to areas in which there's still more work to be done, including the unsealing of 14 wiretaps. Things that the attorney general has fought us on. The documents from post February 4th was the reason that the attorney general was held in contempt. And the I.G. said these needed to be made public.  BAIER: So, now that the I.G. report is finished, do you expect Justice to come forward with those 74,000 documents you've requested? There's still the issue of executive privilege.  ISSA: What's amazing is, there are many documents referred to or used in this report in which they chose to have no executive privilege, and the I.G. was allowed to use them while we were denied them. That's sort of a double standard is just wrong. We're happy that the I.G. had pretty good access.  The I.G., in his report, has gone through a number of areas in which he has to do more work, needs more information. An example is, over at Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Napolitano refused to make available one of the full-time employees of Fast and Furious that happens to fall within her jurisdiction.  As a result, the I.G. was not able interview this individual who was aware and did know about the wiretaps.  BAIER: Congressman, this report seems to indicate that the I.G. didn't find any motive behind the official action of trying to change gun laws. Do you see that?  ISSA: We've never made a statement in any way, shape or form. I know that's been said a lot as a possible motive. We don't know, and perhaps, we'll never know why such a reckless and foolish tactic, not only was done but was continued and then covered up. At the end of the day, though, it was continued, it was covered up, it was knowingly done and people have lied to the American people about it. That's really the reason that this won't end until those people are held responsible. Plus, Bret, I have to mention, having been with the Terry family yesterday, there were still a number of people who were in the chain of actual transport of these guns that killed Brian Terry that have not yet been charged.  So, there are still people who have not been held accountable on the straight criminal side.  BAIER: Congressman Issa, thank you very much for your time tonight.

        "article": "Earlier this month, Puerto Rico announced its first death from Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition causing temporary paralysis that, in this case, was linked to the Zika virus.  Now incidences of Guillain-Barre are said to have risen in seven countries in tandem with outbreaks of Zika, per a study in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The New York Times notes that while the CDC remains wary of saying Zika can cause GBS (it simply says GBS is \"strongly associated\" with Zika), this research offers further evidence that Zika may indeed be responsible—worrisome news, as about 500 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are vulnerable to becoming infected with it.  \"It's pretty obvious that in all seven sites there is a clear relationship,\" says lead author Dr. Marcos A. Espinal of the Pan American Health Organization.  The study found nearly 165,000 cases of Zika virus (some confirmed, some suspected) between April 2015 and March 2016, as well as almost 1,500 cases of GBS, reported in the Brazilian state of Bahia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, and Venezuela.  During the weeks of Zika outbreaks in these areas, the incidence of GBS cases spiked compared to pre-Zika baseline numbers—jumping as much as 877% in Venezuela.  Women had a 75% higher reported incidence rate of Zika than men, but men had a GBS incidence rate 28% higher than women's, and incidence rates also climbed with age, NBC News reports.  (The CDC's Zika funds are almost gone.)  This article originally appeared on Newser: Paralysis Cases Rose in 7 Sites With Zika Outbreaks",

The legislation, spearheaded by Councilman Brad Lander (D-Brooklyn), will require donors to directly link their names to organizations that put out advertisements for candidates running for office. For example, at the beginning or end of an advertisement, when it says \"paid for,\" the person or entity funding the ad needs to include a name. That information will also have to be made available online.  The bill will also require any individual or entity that makes independent expenditures totaling $1,000 or more supporting or opposing any candidate to disclose its expenditure to the Campaign Finance Board.  At a hearing Wednesday, Lander said independent expenditures often come from shell corporations, and he said the bill would solve any confusion as to who is behind the money funding any candidate.  \"Voters need to know what they're getting in,\" said Lander, adding that the legislation would allow New York City to \"clean up our elections.\"  Under current law, disclosure on independent expenditures includes only the name of the individual or organization responsible for the advertisement. But elected officials like Lander argue that many organizations that paid for advertisements in the 2013 mayoral election cycle had generic names that barely told voters who or what the organizations represented, and hid the actual sources of the spending.  During that race, mayoral hopeful Christine Quinn attacked the group New York City is Not For Sale 2013 for a $1 million ad blitz trying to defeat her. Many of the donors backing that ad refused to reveal themselves, according to a Daily News article last April.  The bills must now be passed by the entire Council.",

        "article": "Jamie Foxx as Electro in Columbia Pictures’ “The Amazing Spider-Man 2.” (CTMG.)  This post discusses the plot of “The Amazing Spider-Man 2,” which arrives in theaters today.  One of the best things to happen to fans of genre films, comics and novels in recent years has been the steady dispelling of the idea that cartoons and live-action adaptations of them are necessarily un-serious. But that does not mean that all science fiction, fantasy and superhero stories are necessarily literature. “The Amazing Spider-Man 2,” which arrives in theaters today, is the perfect example of a movie that is coasting on the promise of a big pay-day.  What makes it worse is that the movie is the second in the franchise to waste a good opportunity to tell a story not just about New York’s flashiest villains, but its deepest injustices. Superhero movies do not always have to be about big issues, but I would almost rather they leave off trying if the people involved with them want the credit for relevance, without taking responsibility for handling ideas with substance and seriousness.  The writing and plotting in “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” are awful in a way that gives “cartoonish” a bad name. Characters are constantly leaving for England on a moment’s notice because plot mechanics demand it, or telling people not to get things “twisted,” because that is apparently what the kids say these days. Relationships that have lapsed for decades suddenly bind characters together like chains of fire.  The movie’s lead writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci announced last week that they would be going their separate ways on movie projects, though they will continue to make television together. It is unfortunate that they did not recognize the diminution of their creative partnership before subjecting us to “The Amazing Spider-Man 2.”  But in one respect, the movie has a problem that transcends Kurtzman and Orci’s script and the silliness of its special effects. Like “Spider-Man 3,” released in 2007, “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ loads up on super-villains at the expense of its most interesting ideas and story lines.  The Spider-Man franchise has always been less political and more personal than Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy or the Marvel movies overseen by Joss Whedon. But that doesn’t mean it lacks a very specific perspective on New York. Peter Parker’s modest upbringing is a contrast to Harry Osborn’s wealth. Blue-collar heroes like crane operators and air traffic controllers have a tendency to show up in big climaxes.  In “Spider-Man 3,” Peter (at the time Tobey Maguire) had a reckoning with Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), the man who killed his Uncle Ben, and subsequently acquired superpowers. Towards the end of the movie, we and Peter learned that Marko robbed Ben out of financial desperation, driven by his difficulties finding a steady job after a term in prison, and the shooting was an accident. But “Spider-Man 3″ had no time to explore those ideas, in between Peter’s match-ups with the Green Goblin and Venom. It was worse as a superhero moment, and as a New York movie, as a result.  The pattern repeats in “The Amazing Spider-Man 2.” The most promising antagonist in the film is Max (Jamie Foxx), a put-upon Oscorp engineer. His life is transformed by an accidental encounter with Spider-Man (now Andrew Garfield), who saves him from an incoming car, and tells Max, “You’re not nobody. You’re somebody.” For Spider-Man, it is patter. For Max, it is a talisman against the anger he feels about Oscorp stealing his generator designs, a boss (B.J. Novak) who disrespects him and his crushing loneliness.  Max’s journey from nobody to super-villain could have been an intriguing exploration of race in New York. Before his transformation, Max is exploited by a large corporation. After he is changed, Max staggers out into the streets of New York in a hoodie, looking either physically or mentally ill. And when he is captured, he is turned into a medical research subject by an unscrupulous doctor. Any one of these situations might have been an interesting way into how black New Yorkers are treated by big companies when they are employees, the police when they are homeless or ill, or the medical establishment when they are sick.  “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ gestures at these ideas occasionally. Max, who is fascinated by the prospect of being recognized and acknowledged, is wonderstruck when a news camera projects his image on Times Square screens. He dreams of destroying the power grid that was built with his designs, but without credit or financial reward. And Max tells the doctor who imprisons him that “Everyone’s going to know what it’s like to live in my world, a world without power. A world without Spider-Man.”  The idea is clankingly obvious, both in its connection to Max’s job and his lack of social capital. But give the movie as a whole, the presence of any sort of idea at all counts for a lot. “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ has two other antagonists to deal with, as well as a back story for Peter’s father, and a romantic subplot that turns Peter into a stalker and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) into a flibbertigibbet. It is so crowded that one of the most iconic moments in comics [[major spoiler on that link]], translated onto what ought to have been a grand scale, barely has room to breathe. Everything in the movie suffocates.  “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ exists mostly to keep the rights to the character from reverting to Marvel. But in a media environment where Marvel and DC have both intermittently set stronger standards for superhero movies, even a commercial play like this one ought to try to swing higher. Peter Parker and his city both deserve better.",

        "article": "Recent news of Aetna’s departure from most Affordable Care Act marketplaces sent shockwaves throughout our country. One of the places the impact was felt most strongly was my home state of Arizona, where nearly 10,000 people in Pinal county may be left without a single marketplace plan. News that Aetna had threatened in advance to leave the exchange system if it didn’t get its way in a merger deal is infuriating for Arizonans who are now completely vulnerable as a result of their ploy. It highlights the systemic problems of relying on only for-profit insurers to supply our nation’s health care, and re-opens the debate surrounding a public option for health care.  The Affordable Care Act was continually debated and exhaustively scrutinized before President Obama finally put his pen to the landmark legislation in 2010. The process was thorough, but it was far from complete. Many people involved in the negotiations—myself a main proponent—argued for the inclusion of a public option within the system. Six years later, the public option remains as necessary to a functional system as it is absent from the actual law. We must fix this.  Since 2009, the arguments that I and others made have played out in real life. We said then that we needed a public option to create competition in the market place, help control cost and provide choice to consumers. The same is true today but now there is an even greater case for a public option—the need for added stability. With an assured public option, regulators will not be left to bow to demands of the private insurers like Aetna’s merger threat. It would also free consumers from the fear of backsliding to our old system that forced uninsured people to hunt for affordable coverage on their own. On top of that, the Congressional Budget Office continues to tout billions of dollars in savings from a public option as administrative cost and premiums are estimated to be lower. And perhaps most important, consumers will not be forced to buy private insurance.  Some Republican critics point to unrelated shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act as reason not to invest in improvements like a public option. The recent downfall of many Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (Co-Ops), which had been included in the law to allow non-profit organizations to compete in the health-care marketplace, is being masqueraded as the inevitable outcome of any addition to the law. What these critics fail to mention is that the Co-Ops were intentionally sabotaged by Congressional Republicans who froze their funding in a must pass omnibus bill.  Deliberate sabotage and disingenuous arguments aside, comparing a public option to Co-Ops is akin to comparing apples and oranges. Many of the tiny Co-Ops struggled from the beginning to break into the market to compete against ‘big insurance’ that has perfected the business of making the most profit with the least work. Fortunately, a public option would not suffer this fate; by its very nature, the private market would have to respond to a public option’s presence—not vice versa.  As significant an improvement as it would be, a public option is still not a save-all for our health-care system. If implemented swiftly and broadly, it would create nearly instantaneous stability for the Affordable Care Act and thousands of consumers. However, it would not fully address the long-term problem of the for-profit nature of our health insurance system. Insurance companies, which by their very existence, must put profits above all else, will continue to disrupt and ration services when they must to make an extra dime.  That’s why implementation of a public option, as necessary as it is, will only be a first step towards removing profit motives from our health system. We need a serious discussion in both Congress and in our communities about the feasibility and benefits of expanding and improving Medicare to serve many more people in this country. Medicare operates more efficiently and has far lower overhead then private insurers. According the latest trustee report per-enrollee, Medicare spending growth has averaged 1.4% from 2010 to 2015, while overall health expenditures per capita growth is nearly three times that. Expanding Medicare to a younger, healthier population could create many benefits to the current program and future beneficiaries.  As we see the continued failures of private insurance to provide stable, affordable and quality care to the American public, there comes a time when we must say “enough.” We can’t continue down this dangerous path while the risks are so high. We must act now to implement a public option and we must talk seriously as a nation about the need to transition our system away from the mercy of care-for-profit.",

        "article": "Take heart fans of the Chicago White Sox, Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Florida Marlins, Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. Your teams were hovering around the .500 at the All-Star break. Making the playoffs seemed unlikely. But impossible? Not by a long shot.  In fact, in the last 10 years, 11 teams have made scorching runs in the second half of the season--defined as being after the All-Star Break--to make the playoffs.  In Depth: Baseball's Biggest Comebacks  Take the 2001 Oakland Athletics. The team, despite its promising young pitching trio of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito, sputtered out of the gate and finished the first half of the season at just 44-43. But the team caught fire after the All-Star Break, going 58-17 in the second half of the season. Manager Art Howe said the run \"was a nice way to finish up.\" You think? The A's were stopped in the AL Division Series by the New York Yankees and Derek Jeter's famous \"flip\" play.  The A's cemented their reputation for being a second-half team in 2006. That year they started 45-43, but finished the season by winning 48 of their last 74 games to make the playoffs yet again.  Behind the Numbers We went back 10 years to look at teams that either had losing records or were close to .500 at the All-Star Break and, because of a better second half, made the playoffs. Curiously, not one of the 11 teams won the World Series, maybe a sign of a burnout factor after such hot streaks. For our statistics, we relied on stats site baseball-reference.com.  Along with the A's, the Houston Astros also make two appearances on our list. In 2004 the team began the season 44-44. A second-half surge had two primary catalysts: one was Phil Garner replacing Jimy Williams as the manager in the middle of the season. The other was the acquisition of centerfielder Carlos Beltran, who hit 23 home runs in 90 games for the team. The Astros went 48-26 in the second half and eventually lost in the NL Championship Series to the St. Louis Cardinals.  The Astros did it again the next year, this time without Beltran, who was signed by the New York Mets. After a 44-43 start, Houston went on a 45-30 tear, on the hitting of third baseman Morgan Ensberg (36 homers) and the pitching of Roy Oswalt, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens.  The banner year for second-half comebacks was 2007. The Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees and Colorado Rockies all rebounded from .500 (or thereabouts) at the All-Star break to make the playoffs.  The Phillies were helped by the historic collapse of the New York Mets, who lost 12 of their last 17 to lose their spot at the top of the NL East Division. But not enough credit is given to the Phillies, who won 33 of their last 56 games that year.  The other three teams, however, made the playoffs without as much help as the Phillies had from the Mets. The Cubs, at one point in 2007, were 22-31, but thanks to Alfonso Soriano at the plate and Carlos Zambrano on the mound, they made the playoffs. The Yankees, with their bloated payroll of stars, nearly got manager Joe Torre fired during the season, but went 51-25 in the second half (Torre left the next year anyway). And the Rockies, after a 44-44 start, had an incredible final 30 games, winning 21 of them. They made the World Series that year but were swept by the Boston Red Sox.  Which of this year's teams could be the second-half surger? The Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins and Chicago Cubs, all mired around the .500 mark at the All-Star break, have all shown sparks. Unfortunately, making the playoffs probably won't win a championship--at least not if recent history is any indication.  In Depth: Baseball's Biggest Comebacks",

        "article": "Robert Griffin III hopes to rebound from a disappointing showing against Denver. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  The Washington Redskins look to bounce back from a missed opportunity in Denver last week when they welcome the San Diego Chargers to town on Sunday to kick off a crucial three-game stretch.  San Diego enters the game with a 4-3 mark while Washington is 2-5. But the offensive production is similar: the Chargers average 24.0 points per game; the Redskins, 24.7. San Diego averages 403 yards per outing (294 passing, 109 rushing); Washington, 394 (257 passing, 137 rushing).  The difference shows on defense, however, where the Chargers limit opponents to 20.6 points per game (allowing 379 yards per outing) while Washington surrenders 32.7 points and 397 yards.  San Diego has won three straight meetings against Washington and enters the game as a 1-1/2-point favorite.  Here are five story lines to follow in this game.  1.) Which Griffin shows up – The Redskins returned from the bye and it appeared that second-year quarterback Robert Griffin III had turned the corner, recapturing the explosiveness and elusiveness against Dallas, and passing with great efficiency while also continuing to run vs. Chicago, when he passed for 298 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 84. But then he regressed vs. the Broncos, completing only 50 percent of his passes while throwing a touchdown and two interceptions, and mustering only seven rushing yards on five carries. The Redskins aren’t constructed well enough to win despite bad days from Griffin. They need him at his best just to have a chance. Griffin said he needs “to do more to help this team win,” but didn’t go into specifics. “Be better” was all he would offer despite prodding. Can he display greater confidence both in his own abilities and his line and receivers and play at an aggressive and high level this week? Or will the uneven play continue?  2.) The supporting cast – Much of the blame for the passing game struggles fall on Griffin because he is the quarterback. But his receivers are not faultless. Pierre Garcon has been clutch, averaging seven catches and 73 yards. But no other wide receiver has managed even three catches per game. At times, the receivers have struggled to get open. Other times, Griffin hasn’t spotted them, and other times still, they have dropped passes (Washington ranks seventh in the NFL with 17 drops). The Redskins need another pass-catcher to emerge besides Garcon and tight end Jordan Reed. Playing time has fluctuated for Santana Moss, Leonard Hankerson, Josh Morgan and Aldrick Robinson. Coach Mike Shanahan said he knows he has a No. 2-caliber receiver on his team, but doesn’t know who that player is. Someone needs to capitalize on whatever opportunity he receives, and force his way into consistent playing time with solid contributions.  3.) Play-calling – The other factor in Griffin’s struggles centers on the play-calling, which has been uneven throughout much of the first seven games. Offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan said that against Denver he “didn’t do a good enough job” of calling the right plays and predicting the right coverages that his unit would face – particularly in the second half when Washington allowed 38 unanswered points and had five turnovers. “When I look back at it and I look at myself hard, obviously I didn’t do a good enough job,” Kyle Shanahan said. “When you turn it over five times in the fourth quarter, I mean, that’s all of us. But it starts with me.” His job is to mask deficiencies and put his players in prime positions for success. Can he do that this week?  4.) Pass defense – A week after facing Peyton Manning, the Redskins gear up for another elite passer in Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. In his 10th NFL season, Rivers has gotten off to the finest start of his career, completing 73.9 percent of his passes (tops in the league) for 2,132 yards, 15 touchdowns and just five interceptions. He does a good job of getting the ball out of his hands quickly and can put the ball in tight windows. Rivers’s favorite target is tight end Antonio Gates, who boasts great size, strength, speed and athleticism. Gates has 42 catches (second-most among NFL tight ends) for 497 yards, but only two touchdowns. He could prove a nightmare matchup for Washington’s linebackers and safeties. DeAngelo Hall normally doesn’t match up with tight ends, but the cornerback said that he expected to at times draw the assignment of chipping in and helping limit Gates.  5.) Pass rush – For the second time this season, outside linebacker Brian Orakpo didn’t record a sack, quarterback pressure or tackle when he faced the Denver Broncos. Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and Mike Shanahan will both tell you that Orakpo impacted the game in other ways (including a fumble recovery). But the Redskins do need more out of the player billed as their top pass-rusher. Ryan Kerrigan has 6.5 sacks from his position on the left side of the line, but Washington needs Orakpo (three sacks in seven weeks with two coming against Oakland) to bring the pressure on Rivers as well. The Chargers’ leading rusher, Ryan Mathews, has been just average, rushing for 4.1 yards per carry. If the Redskins can stop the run and then get after Rivers, the chances for turnovers increase and this game should play out favorably for them.",

Related: Star Wars: The Force Awakens – first reactions suggest 'overwhelming experience'  Audiences at the Hollywood and Highland complex reserved their biggest cheers for the stars and creators of the original Star Wars trilogy, which was in cinemas between 1977 and 1983 and ushered in the current blockbuster era. Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, who will reprise their roles as Leia (now General) Organa, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, all received huge roars – and there was a standing ovation for Star Wars creator George Lucas.  We probably'll be stuck in traffic thru first hour of film..bomb dogs currently sniffing the car-almost there pic.twitter.com/KjweJC2fqs  Disney chief Bob Iger thanked director JJ Abrams for delivering “a film that exceeded even our loftiest dreams and expectations”. Early reaction on social media by premiere attendees suggested the new film could be a hit.  The premiere was one of the most elaborate to take place in Hollywood and was said to involve preparations far beyond those required for the Oscars. Disney erected a huge tent, covering four blocks of Hollywood Boulevard in an effort to maintain secrecy outside the Chinese, Dolby and El Capitan theatres. Security was tight, with metal detectors and police dogs on hand to check bags, as well as 50 police officers.  Not everything ran smoothly. Fisher was stuck in traffic and almost missed the event, and then she was held up by security. The notoriously off-message comic and writer, who swore like a stormtrooper on the red carpet, described her younger self during a live camera feed: “She was very busy partying, partying to make sure I would look like shit later. And I don’t mean shit. By shit, I mean not as good as in the other sense.”  There were plenty of stars in attendance, many dressing as Star Wars characters: The Dark Knight Rises’ Joseph Gordon-Levitt turned up as a DIY Yoda, Rainn Wilson came as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Sofia Vergara sported Leia-esque “buns”. The younger heroes and villains of the new episode, John Boyega (Finn), Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), Daisy Ridley (Rey) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) also received enthusiastic cheers from onlookers.  Lucas told reporters on the red carpet that he was amazed by what the franchise had become. “I didn’t think it would be this big when it started,” he said. “It started out wanting to do a film for young people that had psychological undercurrents for people who were going through adolescence – everything from mythological themes to spiritual themes. In the end, I think that is the thing that resonated with people.”  The film-maker, who sold all rights to Star Wars to Disney in October 2012, said the space saga eventually boiled down to just one thing – “families.” He said: “It’s about what one generation leaves behind and the next generation has to deal with.”  The Force Awakens opens in the US on 18 December, a day after the film’s UK release. Some fans have been queuing to be among the first to see the film , at the Chinese theatre since early December. The Force Awakens is expected to be the highest grossing movie of 2016 and could challenge Avatar’s $2.7bn (£1.78bn) as the most successful film at the global box office.",

Alfredsson practised there on Saturday as he prepares for the much-anticipated return to Ottawa as a member of the Detroit Red Wings.  \"Obviously coming back to Ottawa, playing the first game, I'm sure will be emotional,\" Alfredsson said after practice.  \"I'm not sure how I will react but I think it will be a special night.\"  Alfredsson has battled back and groin injuries this season, but he must be feeling pretty good after picking up three points, including two goals, in a Friday night win over the New York Islanders.  But on Saturday, he admitted feeling weird when, as he drove to the rink he played in for almost two decades, he realized he's playing on a different team.  \"It's a very different situation than anything I've ever gone through before so I don't know what to expect or what's going to happen,\" he said.  Alfredsson also said it was nice to see family and friends in Ottawa. His family had come up four days early, too, to see their friends and relatives.  The Senators players said they know it will be emotional but the business of winning a key hockey game will take over once the puck is dropped.  Senators head coach Paul MacLean also said the game would finally bring some closure to a messy break-up between the team and Alfredsson — at least for fans who might still feel sour or hurt.  \"I think it would finally put a close to it, I guess. I know we've moved on, I know Daniel's moved on. This gives the fans an opportunity to move on and I think it'll be good for everybody,\" he said Saturday.  MacLean also said he expects Alfredsson will receive a positive reception from fans.  But the Sens have bigger fish to fry after MacLean tore his team in a post-game rant after their 5-2 loss against Vancouver on Thursday. He hopes they come out as they did the last time they played Alfredsson, a 6-1 win on Oct. 23 in Detroit.  The CBC's Jamie Long will be live-blogging the game here.

        "article": "As a psychologist committed to diversity and equality who also works on a college campus, I often find myself trying to stop students from using derogatory phrases like \"that's so gay,\" \"don't be retarded,\" or \"that's so lame\". But one of the more disturbing phrases I've heard repeated in both schools and colleges is \"no homo\".  The phrase comes from East Harlem slang in the 1990s, originally coined by Rapper Cam'ron. It then made its way into hip-hop culture via a Lil Wayne song in 2008. African American men also commonly use it to refer to behavior they find distasteful.  The Urban dictionary explains \"no homo\" as a \"phrase used after one inadvertently says something that sounds gay\".  For instance: \"Dude, you're so awesome. No homo. Lol.\"  Or: \"I swear, I am so damn glad you are my best guy. No homo.\"  While the phrase has now been largely absorbed into mainstream usage by teens, young adults and white heterosexual males, what this actually means remains contested. Does the use of the phrase display greater acceptance of gay people by men, or is it basically continued homophobia?  The LGBTQ activist side of me understands the phrase's homophobic origins and its offensiveness. But my psychologist side sees how using the phrase has potential for allowing greater emotional expression between men.  Let's make no mistake: a man saying \"no homo\" to qualify his feelings carries a caveat that is inherently homophobic and heterosexist. Yet, he is also expressing himself emotionally, which boys and men are generally taught not to do.  I was deeply impressed by Michael Sam's recent announcement that he was gay. I pictured him turning over this homophobic phrase in his mind as he courageously stepped out of the closet.  No homo? Actually dudes, I am!  He did not qualify a single thing about himself. For this, he has been cheered by many as a leader. He's also been subjected to the expected negative opinions about whether the NFL can really handle an openly gay player.  Recently, Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen's Unplugged video in response to Sam coming out went viral. He challenged others to celebrate difference, however uncomfortable it made them. He said:  I'm not always comfortable when a man tells me he's gay; I don't understand his world. But I do understand that he's part of mine.  Overall, homosexuality has gained wider acceptance in North America, the European Union and a large part of Latin America in the last decade. The legalization of same-sex marriage in some US states as well as other countries is evidence of this.  But this doesn't mean that it's universally accepted. According to a 2013 report by the Pew Research Center, 65% of women believe homosexuality should be accepted, while only 55% of men believe the same. Also, while an overwhelming 70% of Americans under 30 believe homosexuality should be accepted, this number steadily decreases with age: only 64% of those between 30-49 and 52% of people over 50 share this view. The generational gap on the issue is clear. Homosexuality also continues to be stigmatized among African American communities.  So what might it mean for an African American man to come out in a historically racist and homophobic world?  Youth culture, of which Michael Sam is a part, is leading the way in changing attitudes toward LGBTQ communities. Nearly three quarters of millennials think homosexuality should be accepted.  But more men have to learn to become more comfortable with expressing themselves to others, especially to other men. The silver lining here is that men and boys use \"no homo\" following a sincere sharing of emotion with other men. For a man to express himself isn't \"homo\". Like coming out, it's an act of courage and vulnerability. And more men should try it.",

William Boyd. (Credit: Trevor Leighton)  William Boyd. (Credit: Trevor Leighton)  Brett Berk: How did you learn to drive, and why did you give it up?  William Boyd: I learned to drive at around the age of 17, as most people do, in my parents’ car, taught by my father. This was Nigeria, and I remember happily whizzing around the country roads with no provisional license. But then I went to university, where I couldn’t afford to drive, and then met and married my wife, Susan – who could drive – so whenever we needed a car we rented one and she drove it. We actually didn’t buy our first car until we were in our late 20s – a Citroën 2CV –and by then the indolence problem had kicked in.  As someone who doesn't drive, how did you get in the mind of a car lover such as Bond?  I am actually quite interested in cars. For a long period of my non-driving life I employed a local minicab firm. I came to know many of the drivers really well, and when you’re in the back of a minicab, talking to a driver, what do you talk about? Cars.  When it came to my Bond novel, Solo, I knew I’d have to burnish my car-interest significantly. I decided that my Bond – the book is set in 1969 –would be thinking about replacing his old 1933 Bentley convertible. What was the coolest car in 1969? The Jensen Interceptor.  Bond likes big, roomy, powerful cars, so small nippy sports cars are not his thing at all. Even an E-type Jaguar is not really for Bond. [James Bond series creator Ian] Fleming was a lover of American cars – he owned a Ford Thunderbird – so the fact that the Jensen was an English design with an American engine seemed an ideal marriage. Also, aesthetically, the Jensen is a beautiful looking car. I also have Bond drive a Ford Mustang Mach 1 hardtop when the story takes him to Washington DC, and he quite likes the Mustang. At the end of the novel, he’s still deliberating whether to buy the Jensen or not.  What's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you in a car?  Well, it’s back to minicabs again. I was being driven at night to a meeting in central London in one of the minicabs from this firm. It was raining. And then at a junction, we were smashed into by a black cab. Side on. No seat belts in those days, so I was sent flying. I stepped out of the car, feeling very shaken, but uninjured.  The driver of the minicab came up to me. Police had been called. The black cab was badly damaged, its front stoved in. My driver whispered in my ear: “Will, mate, would you mind buggering off? My insurance is a bit dodgy. It would be better if I didn’t have a passenger on board – know what I mean?” So, to do him a favour, I meekly wandered off, dazed and confused, into the rainy night. I think I was still in a state of shock. However, I made a point of asking that particular driver not be assigned to me in future whenever I ordered a car.

        "article": "Are you in Ukraine? Send us your photos and experiences but please stay safe.  Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Freed from prison, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko returned Saturday to the battleground capital the same day the country's president said he left Kiev because of a \"coup.\"  Tymoshenko's release was the latest in a day of dramatic, fast-paced developments that saw Parliament vote to remove President Viktor Yanukovych from office and call for new elections.  \"Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator, Mr. Yanukovych,\" Tymoshenko told a cheering crowd of thousands in Kiev's Independence Square, the scene of deadly demonstrations.  Just hours after her release from a prison hospital, Tymoshenko called for justice for protesters killed in demonstrations sparked by the President's decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union in favor of one with Russia.  \"You were able to change Ukraine, and you can do everything,\" she told the crowd. \"Everyone has a right to take part in building a European, independent state.\"  But Yanukovych took to television airwaves, saying he had been forced to leave Kiev because of \"vandalism, crime and a coup.\"  \"I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate president,\" he said in an interview from Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation.  \"...What I am going to do next is to protect my country from the split, to stop the bloodshed. I don't know how to do it yet. I am in Kharkiv and I don't know what I am going to do next.\"  He did not address reports that he attempted to leave the country by airplane.  According to the head of Ukraine's Border Guard Service, Sergei Astakov, Yanukovych and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk. He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces, Astakov told CNN, confirming an account he gave to Ukraine's Interfax news agency.  In that account, Astakov said border security had approached the plane to check paperwork, and an armed group of people on the plane attempted to offer money to the inspectors to allow the flight to take off.  When the inspectors refused the money, Yanukovych and others in his entourage exited the plane and got into two vehicles that drove up on the tarmac, Astakov is quoted as saying.  Ukraine's dismissed interior minister, Vitaliy Zakharchenko, also was refused exit from the country in a similar incident at the same airport, Astakov said.  The events of the day raise questions about just who is in control in Ukraine, with Parliament voting to oust Yanukovych and hold new elections on May 25.  The vote came just 24 hours after Yanukovych signed a peace deal with the opposition intended to end days of bloody protests.  At the presidential residence in a Kiev suburb, the president's living quarters were vacant, his guards gone.  Government buildings, protest gatherings and the central city were devoid of police and security forces, who had opened fire on protesters this week, killing dozens.  Track how the crisis in Ukraine unfolded  As a CNN crew drove to Yanukovych's residence, it passed checkpoints set up by protesters.  When the crew arrived, the gatekeepers said they were not allowing the general public onto the grounds, but they let journalists enter.  The civil servants asked that the reporters treat his home as a crime scene and referred to it as the \"people's residence.\"  But not everyone in Ukraine was happy with the news.  The country is ethnically split, with many ethnic Russians living in the east. The rest comprises mostly ethnic Ukrainians.  In several cities, people have toppled statues of Vladimir Lenin, a founder of the Soviet Union. The communist empire had included Ukraine until it gained independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.  In a sign of the deep divisions, government supporters took to the streets Saturday night in Kharkiv to protect a monument to Lenin that anti-government protesters threatened to tear down. Police in riot gear stood between the two sides, while others erected a temporary fence around the monument.  In the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, lawmakers passed a resolution to free Tymoshenko, a hero of the country's 2004 revolution that forced the questionable results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out.  Tymoshenko served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and was forced out of office after losing an election to Yanukovych.  She was sentenced in 2011 to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009.  The case against her was widely considered to have been politically motivated, and the United States and other Western nations called her \"a political prisoner.\"  In 2012, after she was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards, she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to \"violence and lack of rights\" in her country.  In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said U.S. officials were closely monitoring developments. \"We have consistently advocated a de-escalation of violence, constitutional change, a coalition government, and early elections, and today's developments could move us closer to that goal,\" he said in a statement.  Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine.  \"Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,\" Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account.  A day earlier, Churkin accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force.  \"If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs that will not produce democracy in Ukraine,\" he said.  By Saturday, a tidal wave of political change appeared to be engulfing Ukraine with key Yanukovych allies leaving office, and the presidential duties being handed off until a new cabinet has been selected.  During the parliamentary session, resignations were announced for the speaker and another leading presidential ally.  Hours later, Parliament elected a new speaker, a rival to Yanukovych, and gave him the duty of coordinating the executive office until a new cabinet is in place.  Another opposition parliamentarian received the duties of acting interior minister.  The Verkhovna Rada sacked Yanukovych's prosecutor general.  The unrest began in November, when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia.  Russia, which has offered to lend money to cash-strapped Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices, has pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators.  Western leaders, who have offered Ukraine a long-term aid package requiring economic modernization, urged him to show restraint, open the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out deep-seated political differences.  But the fight was also about corruption and control. The opposition called Yanukovych heavy-handed, with protesters saying they wouldn't leave Independence Square until he resigned.  Tensions boiled over Tuesday, when security forces charged into a Kiev crowd with stun grenades, nightsticks and armored personnel carriers. The violence escalated, leaving dozens -- protesters and police alike -- dead.

        "article": "For the last five years, the Cafe Carlyle, perhaps the premier cabaret venue in New York City, has devoted the month of November to an act featuring John Pizzarelli, a jazz guitarist and vocalist, and his wife, Jessica Molaskey, a Broadway actress and singer.  My year wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t go. Their exacting musicianship; their ability to weave the Beatles and Sondheim, Jobim and Cole Porter into a seamless set; and their hilarious banter (John is a born ham, Jessica a born foil) invariably make it a memorable evening. I admire the way they make it look easy.  I also admire something else about them: the way they have built their careers. In their late 40s when the Carlyle first booked them, they are the opposite of “overnight sensations.” They have been working at their professions since they were teenagers.  They have had their setbacks. The one time Jessica thought she had landed a breakout role in a musical, the show failed to make it to Broadway. The one time John got a big push from a major record label, the record flopped. But they persevered, never mailed it in and, eventually, were rewarded. From where I’m sitting, their careers can serve as a model for a lot more people than just musicians and actors.  Jessica was 19 when she moved to New York from the small town of Wolcott, Conn., determined to be an actress. Her first audition landed her a role in the ensemble of “Oklahoma!,” which was being revived. “I thought it was going to be like that forever,” she recalls.  But, of course, it wasn’t. Although she had roles in many of the big-budget musicals that rolled through New York — “Cats,” “Les Miz” and the like — the parts were small, and the work ultimately stultifying.  So, in her late 20s, she stopped auditioning for can’t-miss musicals and gravitated instead to the riskier work of younger composers who were building their own careers. She remembers doing shows for $200 a week — and loving it. “I was a lot more broke, and a lot happier. I was learning things.”  John, meanwhile, had grown up around jazz. His father is Bucky Pizzarelli, the great guitarist. Bucky “didn’t teach me how to play the guitar, but he taught me how to love the guitar,” John says. As he got good, his father would take him on the occasional gig, but John was also playing in rock bands and writing songs.  “I thought I was going to be the next Billy Joel,” he says.  The light bulb went on when he started listening to Nat King Cole recordings. “I sorta said, ‘I’m gonna play this music,’ ” says John. That’s what he did in his 20s and early 30s — playing in bars in New Jersey, where he grew up, and in New York City for $40 a night, “barely paying the bills.”  His father would still sometimes employ him — and that would earn him a real paycheck. When I asked John what he learned from playing with his father, his answer was immediate: “Every gig counts.”  John and Jessica met in 1997, when they were both cast in a short-lived musical called “Dream.” They married, had a daughter, and built a life together.  For the most part, they continued their separate careers: John toured constantly with a quartet that included his brother Martin on bass, and Jessica began cutting records in addition to taking the occasional part in a musical. There was never a moment when their careers took off, but slowly, steadily, they each built a substantial, praise-worthy life in music and acting.  John knows that he is never going to be as rich or as famous as Billy Joel. He says he is O.K. with that. Jessica still yearns for that breakout Broadway role. But if it doesn’t happen, she says she’ll be fine.  When she first came to New York, Jessica recalled the other day, her brother dropped her off and then drove back home to Connecticut.  “He told me recently that he felt so guilty leaving me there,” she said. “He wasn’t sure I was going to survive. And there were days when I wondered that myself. I remember going to an audition and thinking, ‘If I don’t get this job I’m going to die, because I only have a dollar to my name.’ But guess what? I didn’t get the job, and I didn’t die. Kids get bailed out now,” she added. “There is something to be said for the resolve it takes to make it on your own.”  She thought about that for a minute. John, who was sitting next to her, looked over at her with a smile.  “There is something really lovely about putting one foot in front of the other,” she said, finally. “You wake up one day and you have a nice career, and a 13-year-old daughter and a house in the country. There is something about the way you earned it that is gratifying.”",

Saying that 1 in 9 bridges are structurally deficient and more than 40 percent of major highways are congested, Obama repeated his call for major infrastructure investment, but it's unclear how or if that will happen.  Announced during his State of the Union speechin February, Obama's Fix-It-First program calls for $40 billion in spending on a backlog of urgent repairs and upgrades. That would follow $31 billion that went into infrastructure as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But those sums are dwarfed by the $3.6 trillion in investment the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) says is needed by 2020.  In its 2013 Report Card for America's Infrastructure, released in March, the ASCE gave the nation a grade of D, with aviation, roads and transit getting D's; and ports and rail a C and C, respectively. The overall grade was a slight improvement from D in 2009, but the group emphasized in a report that \"America's critical infrastructure—principally, its roads, bridges, drinking water systems, mass transit systems, schools, and systems for delivering energy—may soon fail to meet society's needs.\"  With its job-creation allure, infrastructure spending can command bipartisan support, but that doesn't necessarily mean new funding is readily forthcoming. Dating to the interstate construction of the 1950s, the Highway Trust Fund finances highway and mass-transit investment with an 18.4-cent excise tax on gas and other fuels, but that hasn't been raised in 20 years; due to inflation, the fund's purchasing power is only about 62 percent of what it was.",

But there is a spark there of what needs to be done to fix the perennially struggling Argonauts, and restore some dignity to the sport around these parts.  It may be simpler than everyone is making out.  Perhaps it's time for some of those fans who watch the game in the comfort of their home (and there are a couple hundred thousand of you at least) to get off your bums and get down to watch the games if you care even a cow's lick about football. (This does not include those dedicated football fans who have been making the trip regularly for years. You are true and loyal and deserving of respect.)  This is a new and soul-shaking approach for me, as since 1968 I have never put any fault on the fans through the insanity that often revolves around this city's gridiron. Years ago, I was a season subscriber for almost a decade — so I know, Double Blue folk, I know.  The new paradigm hit me while reading stories about ticket sales for Sunday's Grey Cup, perhaps the last to be held around these parts for a long while. Twitter announced with some excitement on Wednesday afternoon \"less than 2,000 tickets\" remained for the game at BMO Field.  Free ducats (remember when they were priced out of the ballpark up until a month ago?) are being handed out to employees of TSN, and rumours of \"papering\" the house are rampant. This has happened at many previous Cups, especially here and in Vancouver, but it's never been done for a stadium with only 35,000 seats.  Here's the deal — Toronto is not, and has not been for around 25 years, a football town.  Why is complicated, but it includes a stupidly shortsighted local TV blackout rule in the 1970s and 1980s that sent an entire generation of Toronto fans to the NFL, plus endless poor ownership decisions and a growing feeling among locals that our game was second class.  Back in 1976, one season before Major League Baseball came to the shores of Lake Ontario, the Argos drew an average of 47,354 fans, with a high of 50,212. In 1981, the average was 33,175 per, with a high of 38,225. It was downhill from there.  CFL football in Toronto, once second only to the Leafs here, has become a boutique sport, loved by a small, though enthusiastic, group of supporters — almost entirely on television.  Young Toronto fans are going to the pro parks and arena in greater numbers these days to see the Blue Jays, Raptors and Toronto FC, and certainly the Argo managers need to find a way to get some whippersnappers of their own.  Football fans can help in a big way by stopping the excuses and getting involved.  There are none that resonate anymore.  You can't complain about the stadium being lousy. Yes, Rogers Centre was terrible for football when it was half full, but BMO Field is an absolute gem. You should see it. Few of you have.  You can't complain it's hard to get to when Toronto FC fans (an average of 26,583 this year) don't see it as a problem. They show up, even when there was construction all around this summer, and the Go Train was delayed because of the heat, and the Bathurst streetcar had turned into hot buses, and parking was a problem.  You can't whine about the team being lousy. Yes, the Argos went 5-13 this year, but they were 10-8 in 2015. They won the Grey Cup in 2012. That's not a long time ago.  Also, week one this year drew 24,812 at BMO Field to see Toronto lose. Three weeks later, only 12,373 came by when the club was 2-1. What, the great new stadium and a winning record were too confusing?  Stop complaining the team isn't \"cool\". Neither are you. You're a CFL football fan in a town where that's equivalent to being the guy who wears an ugly Christmas sweater in February. The Raptors are cool. Toronto FC is cool. The Blue Jays are cool, but they weren't until the 2015 trade deadline. Things change in a hurry.  Don't tell everyone you're waiting for the NFL. The National Football League is not coming. Evah. It's going to London, or St. Louis again, or anywhere but here after the \"Bills in Toronto\" disaster.  Finally, don't use the excuse there's no atmosphere at the games because \"nobody goes.\" Yeah, like you. How about sucking it up, taking a page from Toronto FC fans, and starting a supporter's club for the south end zone? Make noise. Have fun.  Get away from your TV. Put some effort in.",

You know it from the expectant set of her beautiful mouth, the tender tilt of her head, and the exhorting look on her face, which arrest me every time I meet them in the galleries of the Worcester Art Museum.  This child is special, almost spookily so. It turns out she has endured a life of poverty, devoted to praying and penances in her father’s house, and preaching piety, fidelity to the Roman Catholic Church, and good deeds for the poor.  She has also, so the story goes, survived three hours in the flames of a burning pyre (from which she emerged unscathed); raised a dead relative back to life; and tried, when she was but 15, to establish a monastery.  She is Rosa of Viterbo, a 13th-century saint. Her image here — so like an icon in one sense, yet so incredibly lifelike, too — was painted in Seville by Bartolomé Estebán Murillo (1618-82), who for a long time was the most famous Spanish painter of the Baroque.  For two centuries, Murillo was as popular — and arguably as influential — as Raphael. Only in the late 19th century was his reputation eclipsed by El Greco and Diego Velazquez.  Murillo was the youngest of 14 children, and his parents were dead by the time he was 10. Apart from a trip to Madrid (where Velazquez was court painter) in 1658, he spent his entire life in Seville, a flourishing city, rich from the bounty of its busy trade with the New World.  During his formation as an artist, he was heavily influenced by Seville’s other great painter, Francisco de Zurbaran (1598-1664). He painted this image of St. Rosa around 1650, in a manner that already sees him evolving beyond Zurbaran’s austere tenebrist style into something brighter, kinder, more tender.  Somehow, though, the image remains free from the sentimentality that many say weakened Murillo’s later, so-called “vaporous” style. Its edges are soft, its local colors — those pink and blue flowers especially — softer still. But the image is too urgent, too direct, to be accused of sentimentality.  If the painting’s date is correct, it was created in the immediate aftermath of an utterly devastating plague that halved Seville’s population, and from which the city never fully recovered.  So imagine yourself now, if you will, a survivor of that plague — an orphan, perhaps, like the artist himself — attending Mass in a church in Seville, and looking up to contemplate this beautiful child-saint’s face, her sincere, shadowed, imploring eyes — the eyes of a survivor — and the effect they might have on you.

I’ve improved as a quarterback and I’m hoping that can continue over the next several weeks.”  Cousins faced the Falcons in a relief appearance last season as a rookie, throwing for a touchdown and two interceptions in a five-for-nine, 111-yard passing performance.  “It doesn’t hurt” to have faced the Falcons previously, Cousins said. “Any time I get in there, whether I make mistakes or play well, it can’t hurt to get in there and learn from things and gain experience and gain confidence.”  It was a turbulent week in which Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan announced Wednesday that he was sitting down Robert Griffin III for the remainder of the season and going with Cousins as the starter. Cousins said he was able to go about his business even with all that was swirling around him.  “I never felt chaos,” Cousins said. “I never felt like we needed to settle down. I mean, obviously on the outside things are going on. But when it comes to getting ready for the Falcons and practice, there was no settling down that needed to happen. We just went to work and between the lines it was your standard week of a good week of preparation.”  Shanahan said he believes the Redskins are ready to play.  “The main thing is [to] concentrate on your job and even though there are distractions, you want to be able to focus on that,” Shanahan said. “I think we’ve been able to do that as a football team. Our guys have had an excellent week of doing the things that we asked them to do to get ready. I thought today was another good day and hopefully it carries over to the game.”  Of the week that Cousins had on the practice field, Shanahan said: “I think he’s done a good job. I think with all the extra reps that he’s gotten, you feel more comfortable not only with yourself but the timing with the first[-team] receivers and just going through a normal game plan.”  Griffin is to be on the inactive list Sunday while Rex Grossman backs up Cousins.  Shanahan said of Griffin’s practice-field demeanor this week: “He’s been great. He’s done everything we asked him to do.”",

Hizzoner should heed the call of Police Commissioner Bill Bratton — who first rescued Times Square in 1994 — to level the Times Square pedestrian plaza, which has become a casbah of con artists and fleeced tourists.  Time to let New York be New York again, instead of some idealized Hipsterburg or Yuppadelphia.  Start with the Times Square mall.  Then rumble the bulldozers downtown to liberate Herald Square to let traffic flow through the bustling city again instead of diverting it into gridlocked steel centipedes of blaring horns and belching fumes, stalled commerce and mounting road rage.  Start backpedaling on all these precious bicycle lanes that have been shoved down the gagging throat of the city by your predecessor who appealed to the urban kale farmer vote and the bike Nazis who speed through our city without license plates or responsibility, fueled by a sense of arrogant entitlement, rarely obeying traffic signs, red lights or speed limits.  Personally, I don’t care if women walk bare-breasted in Times Square or anywhere else in New York. It is their legal right. But scamming and hustling tourists is bad for New York. I have several family members who live two blocks from Times Square and when I visited my adult daughter last week, I strolled through the Crossroads of the World to see what all the fuss was about.  I spotted two of these topless grubbers hustling knucklehead tourists and assorted horndogs by posing for photos at $5 a pop. They are the new three-card monte scammers, fleecing dopes out of hard-earned dough for a cheap thrill. That panhandling midnight cowboy who twangs his gee-tar in his bloomers has been working that con for years. The women strutting in thongs with painted augmented breasts are about as sexy as a catheter after a Polar Bear Club plunge.  I looked around and imagined how an old flatfoot named Police Officer Tommy Doyle in my old Brooklyn neighborhood would have dealt with these flimflam floozies and the cartoon con artists who also shake down tourists. Doyle would have simply made the pedestrian mall bad for business.  Until the city can push the necessary paper to order the bulldozers to roll, why not use this public space for city events? Put up police barricades to allow a steady stream of people to pass and enter legit stores. On the other side of the barricades, where the cartoon characters and topless babes hustle, the city should hold job fairs. Flood the plaza with thousands of jobless brokesters who can’t afford to pay these hustlers a dime, nevermind $5.  Set up soup kitchens to feed the homeless three times a day.  When the mammary mob swarms 30-strong with their glorified pimps, the city’s Department of Health should roll in a fleet of Mammovans offering free mobile mammograms to promote breast cancer prevention. Not many New York women will be paying to pose with topless scammers. Many guys will be too shamed to pose with the topless gals.  Instead of cleaning highways in orange vests, have those doing court-ordered community service hand out flyers and bark through bullhorns urging tourists — in every language — not to tip these cartoon connivers or topless scammers.

(YouTube)  An al-Qaeda-allied group in Syria has enlisted Tinky Winky in its fight for hearts and minds of Syrians.  One of al-Qaeda’s fatal mistakes in Iraq during the war there was alienating the Iraqi people, who turned against the group that had killed so many civilians and imposed severe Islamist rule. Now, as al-Qaeda-allied factions are pushing into Syria, they’re endeavoring to project a softer, fuzzier image. That’s recently included, for example, a family fair in rebel-controlled Aleppo, complete with ice cream eating contests and sermons about jihad.  Now al-Qaeda’s campaign for Syrian hearts and minds apparently includes toy give-aways, some of them a bit surprising for a group dedicated to total war against Western culture.  The Washington Post’s Liz Sly, toward the end of a recent must-read story documenting al-Qaeda’s growing influence in Syria, surfaced a video posted from Aleppo over the weekend that showed another jihadist family fair. Here it is:  The video showed a gathering there for the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday, held by the al-Qaeda-allied faction Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group, whose name is abbreviated as ISIS because it uses the traditional word “al-Shams” for the Levant, changed its name from al-Qaeda Iraq just a few months ago. The event appears to be a combination of al-Qaeda sermonizing – mostly to children – and a toy giveaway.  The toys that this al-Qaeda group set aside to distribute include Spiderman dolls and, remarkably, Teletubbies. Sly recognized Po and Tinky Winky, the latter of whom became a minor villain among American religious-right groups in the late 1990s when Rev. Jerry Falwell suggested the purple Teletubby was gay.  Presumably, al-Qaeda does not follow Falwell’s sermons or they would not have included this particular toy in their Eid celebration. Sly was alerted to the video and its Teletubbies cameos, she says, by a Twitter follower with the username @HamudiMD. It was earlier surfaced by Aymenn Al-Tamimi of the Middle East Forum.  The bizarre intersection of al-Qaeda and Teletubbies is a strange twist, but part of a deadly serious story. Communal outreach and organization makes it easier for these groups to establish, and potentially entrench themselves within, bases of local support. That will require more than free toys but, if successful, it could have worrying implications for the group’s ability to stick around in Syria.  The rise of ISIS in Syria is no laughing matter. Here’s Sly on the group’s distinctively cruel and deadly approach to the war in Syria:  With its radical ideology and tactics such as kidnappings and beheadings, the group has stamped its identity on the communities in which it is present, including, crucially, ­areas surrounding the main border crossings with Turkey.  Civilian activists, rival rebel commanders and Westerners, including more than a dozen journalists and relief workers, have been assassinated or abducted in recent months in areas where the Islamic State has a presence.",

        "article": "Look, if any of these male nursery web spiders out there want to get busy and perpetuate their lineage, they better not show up empty-handed. Because they could get eaten. Alive.  \"Nuptial gift-giving\" has long been observed in nursery web spiders (Pisaura mirabilis). Basically, male spiders offer female spiders insects wrapped up in silk (yes, a snack packaged in high-end material).  There's been a fair amount of interest in this unique mating ritual, and a new study published this week in Biology Letters sheds further light on it. Researchers found male spiders without gifts were six times more likely to be eaten by female spiders before mating. And that happened \"independent of female hunger.\"  \"We propose that the nuptial gift trait has evolved partly as a counteradaptation to female aggression in this spider species,\" they wrote.  [This lady shark needs a man like she needs a good meal, apparently]  As Science's magazine notes, 15 male spiders in the study that courted without gifts were eaten before mating, compared with just one male spider with a gift. And that gift-bearing spider was eaten after copulation, so from an evolutionary standpoint, he really had nothing to complain about.  Females store sperm in an organ and then release it when there are eggs available to be fertilized. Previous research has shown female spiders prefer males that offer gifts. A 2013 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B by researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark found that females stored more sperm from gift-giving males and had a higher rate of egg-hatching success.  \"The gift facilitates longer copulations and increased sperm transfer, providing two different types of advantage to gift-giving in males,\" those authors wrote.  The gift-giving could also be an indicator of mate quality to females, the researchers noted. The signal: This guy is a keeper, the kind of spider that can catch prey – and pass on superior hunting skills to his offspring.  [This species has no men — and they’re better off because of it]  But lest you feel bad for these male spiders (and you shouldn't because these are spiders, and not people, but anyway), keep in mind that they can be deceitful little creatures. Some males actually bring fake gifts — inedible plant seeds or the remains of an insect they've already eaten — and try to pass off these packages as legit meals.  A 2011 study in BMC Evolutionary Biology found that females responded to worthless gifts by ending mating sooner than if the gift had been good.  Oh, and how do males respond to females that cut mating short and try to run away with the gift? Males pretend to be dead (a practice known as thanatosis). Feigned death took place in half of the matings involving edible gifts, but just once with a fake gift, the 2011 study found.  And sometimes female spiders eat those dead-playing dudes.  \"The evolution of male deceit involves a complex equation of costs and benefits,\" lead author of the 2011 study, Maria Albo, said in a release. \"It costs the males to find and wrap a gift, but these costs can be reduced if the male does not have to first catch his gift, or gives one that has already been eaten.\"  Albo continued: \"The benefit of the gift is longer mating, which leads to more sperm being transferred, and potentially a higher number of offspring. However, the females are wise to deception and terminate mating early for worthless gifts.\"  Study asks why men even exist  Why more than 30 kinds of spiders engage in ‘bondage’  Lady snake gives birth after being alone for eight years  On the verge of extinction, female sawfish resort to 'virgin births' to survive  Shark stores sperm for 4 years before having a pup, a new record",

        "article": "INDIANAPOLIS — An Indiana woman who was once the nation's youngest person on death row but whose sentence was eventually commuted to a prison term was found dead in Indianapolis on Tuesday.  Indianapolis police said 45-year-old Paula Cooper was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound outside a residence on the city's northwest side. Cooper had been released from prison about two years ago, after the Indiana Supreme Court set aside her death sentence and gave her a 60-year prison term.  Cooper was 16 when she was sentenced to death in 1986 after confessing to her role in the murder of a 78-year-old Gary Bible studies teacher the year before. Cooper admitted stabbing 78-year-old Ruth Pelke 33 times with a 12-inch butcher knife in a robbery that netted four youths $10 and an old car. Cooper was 15 at the time the crime was committed.  Her death sentence enraged human rights activists in the U.S. and Europe and drew a plea for clemency from Pope John Paul II. In 1988, a priest delivered a petition to Indianapolis with more than 2 million signatures protesting Cooper's sentence.  Pelke's grandson, Bill Pelke, who organized opposition to the death penalty after his grandmother's killing, said he was devastated to learn of Cooper's death. He said he worked to help Cooper after realizing that's what his grandmother would have wanted.  \"My grandmother would have been appalled she was on death row and that there was so much hate and anger and desire for her to die. I was convinced my grandmother would have had love and compassion for Paula and her family,\" he said in a telephone interview from Anchorage, Alaska, where he runs the Forgiveness Project, a charity that seeks to promote understanding and forgiveness.  Pelke said he visited with Cooper while she was in prison and had last spoke to her last August. He was expecting to hear from Cooper next month, when she was scheduled to be released from parole. He said she had expressed an interest in speaking for his organization.  \"I have no idea what was going on in her life. I thought she was doing well from everything I had heard,\" he said. \"I had hoped she would travel with us. She had always told me she wanted to help young people to avoid the pitfalls that she had fallen into. She said she knew she had done something terrible to society and she wanted to give back.\"  Two years after Cooper was sentenced to death, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an unrelated case that those under 16 at the time of an offense couldn't receive the death penalty. The court said such sentences were cruel and unusual punishment and thus unconstitutional.  Indiana lawmakers later passed a law raising the minimum age limit for execution from 10 years to 16, and in 1988, the state's high court set aside Cooper's death sentence and ordered her to serve 60 years in prison.  Cooper's sentence was reduced due to her behavior in prison, where she earned a bachelor's degree. She was released from prison on June 17, 2013, after spending 28 years behind bars.

The 76-year-old high-powered lawyer's wife is blasting allegations that he bed an underage girl while she was kept as a \"sex slave\" by financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  \"Anyone that knows us would find it laughable if it weren’t so serious,\" Carolyn Dershowitz told Inside Edition in an interview set to air Monday.  \"He is the least likely person in the entire world that this would be true of,\" said his wife of 30 years added.  Carolyn's response follows Virginia Roberts' lawsuit claiming she was forced to have sex with Dershowitz and England’s Prince Andrew, among others, while under Epstein's control at the age of 17.  The now 30-year-old woman recently filed her claims in a Florida court, where she's identified as Jane Doe #3.  Dershowitz further slammed the allegations to NBC’s Matt Lauer on Monday as “totally false and made up\" while calling for the attorneys involved in the lawsuit to be \"disbarred.\"  \"They just threw it in there,\" he said of his soiled name. \"It's the legal equivalent of scribbling something on a toilet stall and then running away.\"  Dershowitz said Roberts' lawyers, Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards, did not bother to investigate her allegations against him.  In addition to Dershowitz calling Roberts \"a complete and total stranger,\" his wife argued that her husband was with her and their daughter at the time of the alleged sexual encounters.  Those are alleged to have occurred in Florida, on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  \"I was ... with Alan. Our daughter was there. Our friends met us for dinner. We were together the whole time,\" she told Inside Edition.  \"The truth will come out, and it will show these two unethical lawyers should be disbarred,\" Dershowitz told NBC. \"The woman has said she wants to have a full investigation.

        "article": "The only thing more difficult than ordering men into harm’s way is sending one’s own son into battle. It has happened throughout history and continues with men and women today, but rarely have there been more sweeping and poignant father-son experiences than during World War II.  Men in command repeatedly found themselves making decisions that affected a younger generation that included their own offspring. These sons were grown men of fighting age, but at some point each of their steely fathers couldn’t help but mutter a silent prayer: “Take care, my boy.”  Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, expressed those worries in a 1942 message and acknowledged the “long periods of silence when your boys will be active at their stations in far places from which no word can come.” Regrettably, Nimitz continued, “there will be losses along the road to victory.”  Nimitz’s own son was in submarines. At the outbreak of the war, Chester W. Nimitz, Jr., was an officer on the Sturgeon operating out of the Philippines. “Boy oh boy!” “Chet” Nimitz later wrote his father after he got his own command, “I get the delicious trembles when I think of my first patrol as C.O.” But Chet’s first sortie with Haddo in March 1944 proved a frustrating experience when torpedoes either exploded prematurely or not at all. Haddo endured terrible depth charge attacks and while the letters Chet posted home were enough to make any father proud, Nimitz shed a private tear or two on those nights when the father knew so well what the son was facing hundreds of feet below the surface.  Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall’s youngest stepson, Allen Brown, was married with a young son of his own, when he enlisted and asked no special treatment. Brown deployed first to Africa and then Italy.  On May 29, 1944, as Brown led his tank unit in the drive from the Anzio beachhead, he stood up in the turret of his tank to reconnoiter the advance. A German sniper killed him instantly. Marshall learned the news in his office at the Pentagon and immediately went to his quarters at nearby Fort Myer to tell his wife. Inspecting the Italian front some weeks later, Marshall visited Brown’s grave in the cemetery near Anzio and insisted upon viewing the site of his last battle.  William Frederick Halsey III wanted to follow his admiral father’s footsteps to Annapolis, but with poor eyesight young Bill ended up in the naval reserve as an aviation supply officer aboard the aircraft carrier Saratoga. On August 7, 1943, Saratoga put into a South Pacific port and Lieutenant Halsey flew to New Caledonia for spare parts and a quick visit to his father’s headquarters. He spent the night with his father and then started back to the Saratoga as a passenger in a torpedo plane.  The evening of his son’s departure, Admiral Halsey came down with a severe attack of flu that took him out of any coherent action for several days. When Halsey was finally able to focus, his operations officer came to his cabin and reported, “Admiral, we have had three torpedo planes missing for two days.”  Halsey knew at once. “My boy?” he asked.  Halsey told him, “My son is the same as every other son in the combat zone. Look for him just as you’d look for anybody else.”  But that brave statement hardly assuaged the worry. Another day passed and then two, making four days since the planes had been reported missing. Halsey, who had often asked others to hold out hope for missing men, now faced his own moment of truth: “Only a miracle can bring him home.” And it came. Searchers spotted rafts beached on an island and all ten men aboard, including Lieutenant Halsey, were safe.  There was another particularly poignant father-son relationship that extended to a third generation. While Vice Admiral John Sidney “Slew” McCain led fast-strike aircraft carriers against Japan, his son, John Sidney McCain, Jr., captained the submarine Gunnel. Four days after the Japanese surrender, Admiral McCain, worn out by the stress of war, dropped dead of a heart attack. He was posthumously promoted to admiral and twenty-some years later, when his son was also promoted to admiral, they became the first father-son pair to hold the four-star rank. When the junior McCain was appointed commander in chief, Pacific Fleet, his own son, John Sidney McCain, III, a naval aviator who had been shot down over North Vietnam, was a prisoner of war enduring five and one-half years of captivity.  World War II and its inherent dangers and uncertainties took its toll across generations. Some of the sons who were rushed into men did not return home. Many daughters did their part in America’s industries and support roles around the world. There were, as Chester Nimitz intoned, “losses along the road to victory.”  Walter R. Borneman is the author of \"The Admirals: Nimitz, Halsey, Leahy, and King—The Five-Star Admirals Who Won the War at Sea,\" just published by Little, Brown.",

This is far from Zimmerman's first controversy since his acquittal in 2013. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)  George Zimmerman wanted to sell the gun he says he used to kill Trayvon Martin. He finally found a website where he could do it, and the gun has gotten a lot of bids. Two were for $65 million.​  It seems likely that the bidding on UnitedGunGroup.com has been taken over by bogus buyers. ​The first $65 million bid was made by “Racist McShootFace,” according to the Associated Press. It has since been taken down.  Zimmerman struggled to find a gun seller that would auction the 9mm pistol. He listed the Kel-Tec PF-9 on UnitedGunGroup.com on Thursday after another website, GunBroker.com, pulled out, saying it wanted “no part” in the sale of a firearm whose use in the fatal 2012 shooting sparked a nationwide debate over race relations and “stand your ground” laws.  “We reserve the right to reject listings at our sole discretion, and have done so with the Zimmerman listing,” a Gunbroker.com statement read. “We want no part in the listing on our web site or in any of the publicity it is receiving.”  UnitedGunGroup.com accepted the controversial auction soon after.  “Unfortunately, Gun broker was not prepared for the traffic and publicity surrounding the auction of my firearm,” Zimmerman said in an email to The Washington Post on Thursday. “It has now been placed with another auction house.”  Todd Underwood, owner of UnitedGunGroup.com, confirmed that the gun was listed on his site, which Underwood called a “pro-Second Amendment community” that was created this year after Facebook banned private gun sales.  “I talked to George Zimmerman earlier today and told him that as long as all laws are being followed, he can list the gun on our site,” Underwood told The Post on Thursday. “I don’t support it, I don’t condone it, I don’t have anything against it. It’s his property, it’s his decision.”  But UnitedGunGroup.com took down the listing Thursday night because, it said, the auction did not reflect the organization’s mission, according to USA Today.  “Our mission is to esteem the 2nd amendment and provide a safe and secure platform for firearms enthusiasts and law-abiding citizens,” the site said in a statement. “Our association with Mr. Zimmerman does not help us achieve that objective.”  The auction, however, was back on the website Friday morning, apparently without explanation.​  The listing features the pistol Zimmerman said he used more than four years ago to shoot and kill Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Sanford, Fla.  “I am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon,” Zimmerman wrote for the description of the gun. “The firearm for sale is the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012.”  By Friday morning, the auction had more than 1,000 bids — including one for $65,039,000.  That bid followed another one for $65 million from “Racist McShootFace,” who was later removed from the website, according to the Associated Press.  Other bidders included one going by the name “Tamir Rice,” a reference to the 12-year-old African-American boy who was fatally shot by police in Cleveland in 2014.  Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Martin in Sanford, and he was acquitted by a Florida jury in July 2013.  “Why shouldn’t he be selling it?” Underwood, from UnitedGunGroup.com, told The Post on Thursday when asked about outrage sparked by Zimmerman’s auction plans. “Here’s the thing, parents lost their child and as a father it breaks my heart to even contemplate going through what they went through.  “But when you look at the facts of the case, he was charged and he was exonerated by a jury of his peers. This shouldn’t even be a story. A gentleman who did nothing wrong is selling a personal possession of his to the highest bidder.”  Zimmerman said in the listing that proceeds of the auction will be used to “fight [Black Lives Matter] violence against Law Enforcement officers” and to “ensure the demise of Angela Correy’s persecution career and Hillary Clinton’s anti-firearm rhetoric,” though he hasn’t described how that would happen.  [George Zimmerman’s many, many controversies since the Trayvon Martin case]  Corey, whose name was misspelled, is the special prosecutor who was appointed by then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to investigate Martin’s shooting death.  An attorney for Martin’s family said Thursday that Zimmerman’s plan to auction the gun was “insulting and disrespectful.”  “It is insulting to this family that he would decide that he would sell the gun that he killed their child with,” Daryl D. Parks, one of the attorneys for the family, told The Washington Post. “Think about what that means: This is a gun that took a child’s life, and now he wants to make money off of it.”  On both auction websites, Zimmerman claimed the case number from the trial is written on the gun in permanent marker and that “The Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C.” has expressed interest in “owning and displaying the firearm,” though he did not specify which museum.  The Smithsonian Institution, which operates 19 museums, refuted that claim Thursday morning, before the gun disappeared from the auction site.  We have never expressed interest in collecting George Zimmerman’s firearm, and have no plans to ever collect or display it in any museums  — Smithsonian (@smithsonian) May 12, 2016  “The firearm is fully functional as the attempts by the Department of Justice on behalf of B. Hussein Obama to render the firearm inoperable were thwarted by my phenomenal Defense Attorney,” Zimmerman wrote, “I recognize the purchaser’s ownership and right to do with the firearm as they wish.”  He closed the description with si vis pacem para bellum, which means “If you want peace, prepare for war” in Latin.  [Anger flows at acquittal of George Zimmerman in death of Trayvon Martin]  Zimmerman told Fox affiliate WOFL on Wednesday that he “recently received [the gun] back from the Department of Justice. They took it after my trial, after I was exonerated.”  He told the Orlando station that he had received death threats since listing the firearm on Gunbroker.com but decided to continue with the sale anyway.  “What I’ve decided to do is not cower,” he said. “I’m a free American. I can do what I want with my possessions.”  Parks, the attorney for Martin’s relatives, said Thursday that “the family does not want to dignify this with a response. Everyone agrees this is insulting and disrespectful. Without question, as time passes, we are seeing more and more the real person — who George Zimmerman really is versus who he was portrayed to be by his defense team.”  [George Zimmerman inserted himself into 2016 politics. Now a Clinton ally is tying him to Trump.]  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) criticized Zimmerman’s decision to sell the gun in a statement issued shortly before the sale was halted then moved to the second auction site.  “Trayvon Martin’s cold-blooded killer should be in prison,” Jeffries said. “Instead, he is trying to profit from the stunning miscarriage of justice that occurred three years ago in a Florida courtroom. It should shock the conscience of every decent American that this man is peddling his murder weapon for sale. America must reject this merchant of death once and for all.”  Lucy McBath, faith and outreach leader for Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement that she was “deeply disappointed” that Zimmerman would try to profit from the “very gun he used to cut that precious life short.”  “But what’s even sadder is that this deplorable lack of value for human life is espoused not only by him — but also by the gun lobby that has created and continues to push for laws that allow people like him to shoot first and ask questions later,” said McBath, whose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed at a Florida gas station in 2012. “Florida’s dangerous Stand Your Ground law was the defense used in Trayvon’s murder and in the murder of my dear son, Jordan Davis. And it’s the same kind of legislation that NRA-backed legislators in Missouri brought up again recently — and that the gun lobby continues to push for in states across the country, including in Florida where they are still trying to expand the law.  “It’s time we stand up to this dangerous thinking — as I know from firsthand experience, the lives of our children and the safety of our communities depends on it.”  This isn’t the first time Zimmerman has caused controversy by selling a personal item. In August, he teamed up with Florida Gun Supply — a store that had publicly declared itself a “Muslim-free zone” — to sell prints of a painting by Zimmerman depicting a Confederate battle flag. It included the inscription, “The 2nd protects our 1st,” presumably referring to the Second and First amendments.  This post has been updated.",

From replying to a rude comment to placing the pink woman next to a smoking hot selfie, adding the notorious sassy emoji always adds a touch of sassiness.  For many phone users, the feisty brunette emoticon appears to be flicking her hair with attitude.  But sadly, her hair flipping days might now be over.  A new iOS 10 update has completely transformed the pink lady, swapping her excited grin for a modest smile.  Another big difference is that the position of her hand no longer looks like she is swishing her hair.  Following the change, irritated Apple fans have taken to social media to vent their frustrations.  One commenter remarked: “God what even is the sassy girl emoji. She’s not even trying.”  Others debated about what the new look emoticon should come to represent, creatively giving the character a whole new backstory.  The iOS 10 update has turned Sassy Girl Emoji into a 40 year old mother who can't decide if she's cooking Italian or Thai for dinner ????????  — Emily Sandford (@SandfordEmily) September 14, 2016  A Twitter user suggested: “The sassy girl emoji now looks like an emotionally disturbed waitress who can’t admit her favourite tray was stolen.”  Another piped up: “The iOS 10 update has turned Sassy Girl Emoji into a 40 year old mother who can’t decide if she’s cooking Italian or Thai for dinner.”  It’s not the first time that the sassy woman emoji has sparked controversy online.  In April, The Sun reported that you’ve probably been using the emoticon wrong.  Instead of the graphic representing a feisty woman, it’s actually meant to signify an “Information Desk Person”.  Creators of the emoji app imply that she’s meant to be used in times where phone users are announcing some “exciting personal news”.  This bombshell certainly didn’t impress all the sassy ladies out there.  One irate Twitter user even remarked: “Biggest disappointment of my day: finding out that the sassy af ‘hey girl’ emoji is really named ‘information desk person’.”",

        "article": "A shrine dedicated to Rosa Diana Suárez Torres in the home of her father, José Diego Suárez Torres, Dec. 11, 2014. Alicia Vera for Al Jazeera America  José Diego Suárez Padilla has constructed the windows of his home to look like his daughter's eyes. Alicia Vera for Al Jazeera America  ATIZAPAN DE ZARAGOZA, Mexico — José Diego Suárez Padilla has converted his home into a shrine to his daughter, Rosa Diana. Windows fashioned after her blue eyes stare out on the street. A painting of the girl in a white party dress covers a living room wall, overlooking an altar with offerings of chicken and chewing gum. The food has lain there so long that the red chili sauce has congealed.  Suárez Padilla explains to a visitor that he normally puts out fresh food but lately hasn’t had time. That’s because he’s busy all day consulting with lawyers and politicians to seek justice for her death.  Four years ago on New Year’s Eve, a jealous ex-boyfriend stabbed to death the 22-year-old secretarial student and bashed her face into a purple pulp. Suárez Padilla spent 10 months hunting down the youth when he went on the lam — authorities would not make the effort. Even though the young man confessed, he has not been sentenced. Suárez Padilla wants to see him behind bars, alongside the police who denied a restraining order two months before the murder when the youth burst into the house, stole her cell phone and threatened to kill her.  “They said it wasn’t a crime. What are public servants for if they don’t serve justice? They could have prevented her death,” says the anguished father, showing a file of documents a foot high that he has assembled to press his case.  His anguish resonates across Mexico, which local United Nations officials say ranks among the world’s 20 worst countries for violence against women. Newspapers routinely report “crimes of passion” or unidentified female body parts floating in sewage canals. Misogyny and corruption prevent most cases from seeing justice.  The bedroom of Rosa Diana Suárez Torres, Dec. 11, 2014.Alicia Vera for Al Jazeera America  According to the National Citizen Femicide Observatory, a coalition of 43 groups that document the crime, six women are assassinated every day.  Yet only 24 percent of the 3,892 femicides the group identified in 2012 and 2013 were investigated by authorities. And only 1.6 percent led to sentencing.  “Femicides are a pandemic in Mexico,” asserts Ana Güezmes, the local representative of United Nations Women, the agency devoted to gender issues.  The word \"feminicidio\" first entered the vernacular in the 1990s, with explosive rates of disappearances and murders of women in the border town of Ciudad Juárez. In fact, more women have been killed in the state of Mexico, which surrounds the capital city of the same name. The number doubled from 2005 to 2011, when the current national president, Enrique Peña Nieto, was governor of the state. Today he has pledged to combat drug violence overall but has not spoken out against femicides.  Impunity is the main motor of the gender crime, Güezmes says, as well as social norms that allow the violence to be ignored or accepted as a normal part of life. She describes femicides as the extreme end of a society where 63 percent of women have suffered abuse by male hands. She estimates that maybe a third or half of the cases involved sexual partners. The balance — abductions, rapes and discarding the bodies like garbage — are probably linked to the generalized drug violence that is tearing Mexico apart.  Güezmes says the government needs to put more effort toward prevention, and improve access to justice. “These are the biggest problems.”  To counter the lack of reliable government statistics, the Observatory trawls through press clips and conducts interviews door-to-door in marginalized neighborhoods, like this one on the edge of the capital city, where cases normally take place.  Newspaper clippings related to the killing of Mariana Lima Buendia are kept by her mother.Alicia Vera for Al Jazeera America  The group issues regular reports and provides pro bono lawyers to relatives seeking to prosecute killers. They also erect pink crosses at death scenes, but these rarely last more than a day before unidentified men take them down.  Most of these cases get lost in Mexico’s dysfunctional justice system, where police officers can’t be bothered to probe, or claim it’s the woman’s fault, or can be bought off by criminal gangs, says Maria de la Luz Estrada, head of the group. When the murders are investigated, incompetence and failure to follow due process often allow murderers to escape punishment.  Activists say the distinction of femicide in the law is important, because the sexual nature distinguishes the killings from ordinary homicide.  “Hate is what marks these crimes. The bodies show 20 or 30 blows,” de la Luz says. “They slice off breasts and faces and throw the fragments in the garbage. In a macho society like Mexico, authorities are always questioning what the women did. What was she wearing? Was she sexually active? This helps the impunity and lack of action.”  The victims are generally vulnerable young women, impoverished single mothers or teens. Attackers frequently seize victims on empty streets as they leave school or work, force them into cars, and then rape and torture them and dispose of the bodies.  Families in poor areas like this one generally lack the money or clout to seek legal action, says de la Luz. “The parents are scared to give photos and details to the police, because that can make them vulnerable to extortionists, who say, ‘We have her,’ when in fact they don’t. Corrupt authorities often say, ‘If you speak out, your case won’t advance.’”",

        "article": "Updated Dec 19, 2013 1:05 AM ET  The question was appropriate the day the Mariners signed Robinson Cano, and it is even more appropriate less than two weeks after the M's fired the $240 million shot heard 'round the baseball world.  What the heck are the Mariners doing?  Club officials are signaling to certain agents and others in the industry that the team is near its payroll limit, though certain exceptions may be made for the right player.  Perhaps that player is left-hander David Price, whom the Mariners continue to discuss in trade conversations with the Rays, according to major-league sources.  Perhaps that player is free-agent outfielder Nelson Cruz, who would be a more realistic choice than first baseman/outfielder Corey Hart to serve as the right-handed complement to Cano.  Whatever, it had better be somebody.  Actually, it had better be more than one somebody, seeing as how the Mariners need another starting pitcher, additional offensive help and arguably a closer, too.  If the Mariners are done spending — if they truly are drawing the line after adding Cano and three lesser, oft-injured hitters — then the only thing that can be said about their plan is that there was no plan at all.  Once the Mariners signed Cano, they were all-in — or, at least, they should have been. The move, it appeared, was an attempt to regain credibility, rekindle a dormant, disgruntled fan base. But Cano, 31, cannot do all of that alone. Nor can he do it in mere combination with Hart, first baseman/outfielder Logan Morrison and outfielder Franklin Gutierrez.  Granted, the offense should improve from poor to respectable if Hart and Morrison stay healthy. Combine that with right-handers Felix Hernandez and Hisashi Iwakuma at the top of the rotation, and the team overall should be more competitive.  Still, the Mariners need to keep going.  Otherwise, they will risk wasting the early years of Cano's contract, which coincide with the final years of his prime. Otherwise, they will turn into this year's botched big-money experiment, the 2012 Marlins or '13 Blue Jays, only with arguably less talent.  Maybe the Mariners are simply engaging in classic offseason misdirection, plotting another series of dramatic moves. If so, more power to them. If not, they will face a series of questions, none of them pleasant.  Do the Mariners believe that Cano can almost single-handedly help the team's young hitters improve? Do they think that their sophisticated fan base will be tricked into believing that this group of players will suddenly contend?  That illusion should be shattered by the end of April, in a division that includes the Athletics, Rangers and Angels, all of whom could be significantly improved by Opening Day.  Again: What are the M's doing? What is the plan?  And how will general manager Jack Zduriencik survive if the Mariners' 2014 season disintegrates into another mess?  Zduriencik — the architect of four straight losing seasons and subject of a recent Seattle Times article in which former employees lambasted him on the record — soon will answer to a new club president.  Ownership obviously backed the signing of Cano. But if the team could not extend much beyond that — Hart, Morrison and Gutierrez will cost about $9 million combined — then Zduriencik needed to say, \"Hold on. Let's slow down, spread the money around.''  That is not what happened. And if Zduriencik assented, thinking that the addition of Cano would be perhaps enough to save his job, then he was sadly mistaken. Another disappointing season, and he will be gone.  In any case, the truth soon will be known.  Whether the Mariners have reached their spending limit or whether they have not. Whether they intend for Cano to be the centerpiece of a renaissance or an expensive bauble along with King Felix.  Less than two weeks into The Cano Era, the clock already is ticking.  You take that first step, there is no turning back.",

        "article": "Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times  Tim Artz sampled the fruits of his brewery, located in the Florida room of his home in Oakton, Va. With his large setup, he can brew 30 gallons at once.  TIM ARTZ’S brewery is enclosed by glass walls on three sides and looks out onto a bluff of apple trees and a garden filled with beans, squash and 35 varieties of pepper. On a raw April morning, the brewery doors were open but the brewery itself was warm; the gas burner below the 30-gallon brew tank was cranking at near full power.  Mr. Artz was already a good 90 minutes into his brew day; the grain was milled and the hops were measured and waiting on a nearby table. It was just the moment for his wife to emerge from the house and ask if he and his guests would like a fresh mug of coffee.  Mr. Artz, 48, is just a home brewer, not a professional; his main job is director of information technology at a health care firm. But with the elaborate set-up he has built and installed in his Florida room (there is a big cask for holding mash and an $1,800 fermentation tank, in addition to the 30-gallon kettle), he could easily be mistaken for much more than an amateur.  Home brewing, which was rendered illegal by Prohibition and not legalized again until 1979, is enjoying a resurgence. The American Homebrewers Association, based in Boulder, Colo., had just 11,724 members in 2006; that has since more than doubled, to 26,000. This increased interest, in turn, has fostered a mini-boom in brewing equipment, according to Gary Glass, who is the director of the association. “Home-brew supply shops reported a growth of 16 percent in gross revenue, according to 2009 numbers,” Mr. Glass said, referring to the change from the prior year. The numbers for 2010 are not yet available, he added, but he anticipates double-digit growth once again.  This increase has been aided by the rise of social clubs, books and competitions geared to home brewers, as well as by the success of microbreweries over the last two decades, which has inspired many amateur beermakers. The D.I.Y. and locavore movements have played a role, too. “There is a trend to do things more locally,” Mr. Glass said. “You don’t get any more local than doing it at home.”  Even the recession did not slow things, Mr. Glass added. “Part of the theory,” he said, “is that people have more time for hobbies when they are unemployed or underemployed.”  In a way, the revival recalls America’s roots. The Pilgrims are said to have landed at Plymouth Rock rather than continue on to Virginia, because they had run out of beer and wanted a fresh supply. Many founding fathers brewed ales on their farms. (George Washington’s recipe for a porter brewed with molasses, recently recreated by a Brooklyn brewer, has been commercially produced by the Shmaltz Brewing Company.) Even the Obamas have joined in; they served an ale brewed at the White House and flavored with honey from the beehives there at their Super Bowl party this year.  For many people, home brewing summons visions of beat-up equipment that is stashed in a corner of a garage, dragged out only occasionally, powered by modest propane tanks normally attached to the barbecue and yielding just a few gallons. (Professional breweries measure output by the barrel — roughly 31 gallons each.)  But as the ranks of amateur brewers grow, more of them are like the Artz family, people with high-end equipment who brew lots of beer and have a dedicated brewing space in their homes.  “When we looked at the house and walked into the room, we both knew this is where the brewery would be,” said Dot Artz, who occasionally brews with her husband but on that April day was growing crystals in the kitchen with the couple’s 8-year-old son, Ben. (A true D.I.Y. family, they also forage for mushrooms, make their own soap, keep four beehives and smoke meat on a large smoker made out of a cleaned and repurposed oil drum.) The Artz family has also made substantial outlays for their pastime. Mr. Artz rolled his eyes and grinned mischievously when asked how much he has spent on brewing over the years. “A lot,” he said. “It is definitely not a cheap hobby.”  Some home brewers who invest heavily harbor ambitions of one day opening a professional brewery (as amateurs they cannot legally sell their wares). But other big spenders have no grand business plans; they equate brewing to activities like golf: a pastime that is a labor of love, exploration, trial and error, frustration and, finally, pride, when the water, malt, hops and yeast combine just right to pour a perfect pint.  For these dedicated hobbyists who are willing to spend money, said Mr. Glass, beer equipment manufacturers, like Sabco, of Toledo, Ohio, and More Beer, of Concord, Calif., are now making high-end commercial-grade products for home use.  “It is still the exception, not the rule,” said Mr. Glass, who is emphatically not one of the high-end hobbyists. He brews about six times a year, and does so on a Frankenstein system, an affectionate term used by home brewers to describe a mishmash of equipment that is not pretty, but gets the job done.  But the president of Sabco, Bob Sulier, believes the number of high-end brewers is growing. In the past, the company’s Brew Magic system — their $6,000 flagship — was sold primarily to professional brewers, he said, but now many are being bought by home brewers or home-brew groups. In 2010, the company sold about one Brew Magic system a day, he added.  \"We cater to the higher end of the group, the advanced home brewers,” Mr. Sulier said. “For many, this is the next logical step. They are willing to drop a dollar.\"  For many, the hobby began in college. Some wanted to drink well for less money and others were inspired by “starter” products like Mr. Beer kits, plastic barrels costing about $40 that have pre-measured ingredients and simple instructions and yield about two gallons of beer.  But like many pastimes, home brewing can grow addictive — and become more expensive.",

        "article": "Are we raising a generation of wimps?  Dig even a little (try Googling \"wussification of America\") and you'll find no shortage of experts and private citizens ready to say that dodgeball bans, preoccupations with self-esteem, and sanitized childhoods devoid of skinned knees are collectively raising a cadre of wusses.  These coddled children, they say, will be unprepared for the brutal real world, which doesn't give everyone a trophy.  On the other side of the fence are experts and parents who contend that these fears are overblown and represent nothing more than adult nostalgia for days gone by. Children are still taught valuable social lessons without learning to pick on each other or solve problems through violence.  Have parents gone overboard in their zeal to keep their children safe?  Argument No. 1: Kids need to learn to fail, and the earlier the better.  A large argument in favor of the idea that parents are stifling their kids is the notion that childhood should reflect adult life, and provide a place to prepare for it.  Dodgeball, like other competitive sports, are models for life and have been historically treated as such, said Matt Labash in \"What's Wrong With Dodgeball\", originally published in The Weekly Standard.  Hara Estroff Marano, author of \"A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting\" agreed in an interview with Time magazine when she spoke about the reasons for the mental breakdowns of college students.  \"They are the products of parental anxiety and all the lumps and bumps have been taken out of life for them, so they have no idea how to manage the normal vicissitudes of life,\" she told the publication.  Argument No 2: Free, unstructured play is important, and kids don't get enough.  In a recent study published in the online journal Qualitative Sociology by Markella Rutherfod, assistant professor of sociology at Wellesley College, it was found that parental attitudes toward behavioral restrictions had undergone a near reversal in the last 80 years.  In earlier decades, parents put a lot of demands on their children in the home, but generally gave them free reign outside of it. They managed their own affairs and peer relationships, and engaged in unstructured, unsupervised activities.  As time went on however, the areas of freedom and structure switched. Children weren't obligated to do chores, were free to disagree with their parents, and could make their own decisions inside the home, Rutherford explained.  However, their time outside the house was increasingly supervised by adults and structured in some way. Gone were the hours of backyard baseball leagues with no adults present.  Peter Gray, a developmental psychologist from Boston College, explained the evolutionary role of free play in an article on Livescience.com  Free play he said, even that which takes the form of an otherwise competitive game such as baseball, usually has little regard for winning and losing and instead builds egalitarian relationships.  \"Striving to do well . . . and helping others to do well, is all part of the fun. It is the presence of supervisors and observers that pushes play in a competitive direction - and if it goes too far in that direction it is no longer truly play,\" Gray said in the article.  Argument No. 3: Parents overestimate the day-to-day dangers kids face.  Complicating the ability of parents to keep their kids safe is the changing perception of risk, said Rutherford. While \"it's good that we have safety laws and helmets,\" activities such as riding a bike or in a car are perceived as a dangerous in a way they did not used to be, she said..  Rutherford said that from the first moment they become parents, mothers and fathers are educated to constantly evaluate and be aware of risk. Public awareness of kidnapping and child phsycial and sexual abuse is so high that man parents may have \"fear out of porportion to the magnitude of risk.\"  Said Marano: \"As parental hysteria has escalated due to anxieties, the actual data show that this is not a legitimate fear. When you look at the Department of Justice data, this is just not a major phenomenon.\"  Argument No. 4: Kids still learn social lessons, just differently.  Perhaps the most often-repeated defense of dodgeball and other competitive games is that kids learn to lose and maybe try harder next time. However, there are still ample opportunities for these lessons.  Afterschool sports and varsity sports still exist. And even when every kid is given a trophy, they're not fooled, Rutherford says. Instead, they simply receive inaccurate feedback from adults, when they themselves still know where they stand.  Also, putting kids together with obviously different abilities may help them to be accommodating. Inclusive classrooms, where developmentally disabled children are integrated with those without learning disabilities benefit all students, according to Rutherford. They allow more advanced students the opportunity to help their peers and receive social satisfaction.  Finally, kids are simply explicitly taught about social interaction instead of being left to their own devices. Many schools employ social development curricula, Rutherford said, which focus on building peer relationships.",

        "article": "Similar collaborations between private companies and nonprofits will pose tricky questions under a policy intended to end earmarks to profit-making firms, which Obey helped shepherd through the House Democratic caucus last week. That new rule was widely touted as a crackdown, but in reality it could leave untouched almost 90 percent of typical earmarks.  The reason is that, like Obey's earmarks, most of the billions of dollars in earmarks approved by Congress each year involve handing out funds to state or local agencies or to nonprofit institutions, which then dole out part of the money to private contractors.  As a result, the new Democratic rule, and a proposal by House Republicans to stop all earmarks for one year, are unlikely to significantly curb Washington's booming earmark industry, experts said. Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit that has criticized earmarking, called the new limits important but compared them to \"squeezing a balloon.\" Without more comprehensive restraints, he said, the money flow could simply move to new pathways.  In the wake of last week's announcement, road-builders, architectural and engineering firms, construction companies, scientific researchers and myriad private firms exploring obscure or unrequested projects will probably expand cooperative ventures with nonprofits, Ellis and others said. But the reach of the House Democrats' policy change remains unclear, raising questions about loopholes and how easily it will be to prosper from them.  In making their announcement on Wednesday, the Democrats estimated that about 1,000 earmarks -- or 11 percent of those in this year's appropriation bills -- would have been cut if their new policy had been in effect. That would have left in place around 8,400 earmarks, worth about $8.3 billion. Eliminating those requested solely by House Republicans would have cut another $800 million, leaving most earmarks unscathed, Ellis's group said.  Moreover, neither the Democrats' ban nor the Republicans' proposal would cover much larger, congressionally directed grants and contracts to major federal contractors, worth $5.9 billion in the 2010 appropriations bills. That is because lawmakers narrowly defined what constitutes an earmark to include only entities that did not compete for funds.  That leaves out big-ticket defense programs expanded or kept alive annually by lawmakers to boost home-state employment or to meet less-than-urgent needs of the Defense Department. In 2010, these included 10 unrequested C-17 transport planes costing $2.5 billion, unrequested all-terrain vehicles costing $825 million, 14 other unrequested planes costing $732 million, and an unrequested, second engine for the F-35 jet costing half a billion dollars.  Ellis calls these \"undisclosed earmarks\" because they were added to the budget at the request of lawmakers and defense contractors who had nonetheless competed to win the initial contracts.  In another loophole, the Senate, which does not seem to share the House's anxieties about earmarks, can readily reinstate what the House has now banned and those seeking access to public funds could shift their earmark lobbying and related campaign spending to the Senate. \"If the Senate doesn't go along . . . it will make these changes toothless,\" Ellis said.  Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) affirmed last week that he sees no reason for change.  \"The truth of the matter is that many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby for themselves or employ lobbyists,\" Inouye said. \"In addition, it is no secret that many of these individuals make political contributions.\" But giving up earmarking would not be \"in the best interests of the Congress or the American people,\" he added, because some earmarks had produced outstanding results.",

        "article": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (CNN) -- Sharp confrontations over health care and other issues highlighted a debate among the Democratic presidential front-runners Monday night, with the sniping threatening to overshadow substance days before the South Carolina primary.  Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama started arguing almost as soon as the debate began.  Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama engaged in particularly sharp exchanges.  With Obama, the senator from Illinois, polling well in the state -- especially among black voters -- Clinton, the New York senator and former first lady, and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina used the debate to put Obama on the defensive over a health care plan they say doesn't offer coverage for everyone.  \"If you don't start out trying to get universal health care, we know -- and our members of Congress know -- you'll never get there,\" said Clinton, who pushed a failed effort at expanding health care when her husband was president.  \"If a Democrat doesn't stand for universal health care that includes every single American, you can see the consequences of what that will mean.\" Watch the back-and-forth over health care »  Clinton and Edwards promote plans that would guarantee coverage for all Americans. Obama wants to guarantee health care is affordable to everyone while not requiring everyone to buy it.  \"I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care,\" Obama said. \"The problem is they can't afford it.\"  Obama countered that Edwards has said the plan may have to be paid for, in part, by deducting money from people's paychecks, and he said Clinton has been vague on how her plan would be funded. See what the candidates said on the issues »  Just minutes into the debate, sponsored by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Clinton and Obama -- who rank one and two in national polls -- started with the attacks. See what CNN's political team thought about the attacks »  The exchanges saw the two interrupting each other and turning to direct their responses to each other instead of the panel of moderators.  \"It is very difficult having a standup debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote,\" Clinton said. She attacked Obama for not supporting a Senate amendment that would have capped the interest rate on credit cards at 30 percent. \"It's just very difficult to get a straight answer.\"  The comment drew boos from Obama supporters.  Obama attacked Clinton for working as \"a corporate lawyer sitting on the board of Wal-Mart\" while he was a community organizer. Clinton jabbed Obama for representing a \"slumlord\" when he was a lawyer in Chicago. The exchanges let Edwards, a South Carolina native, cast himself as the candidate more interested in policy discussions than political sniping.  \"This kind of squabbling -- how many children is this going to get health care? How many people are going to get education because of this? How many kids are going to get to go to college because of this?\" Edwards said to cheers from the crowd. \"I respect both of my fellow candidates, but we have got to understand this is not about us personally.\"  A recent national poll showed 59 percent of black Democrats supporting Obama, who is black, compared to 31 percent for Clinton. That's a sharp increase over earlier in the campaign and a particularly big factor in South Carolina -- where as many as half the voters in the Democratic primary will be black.  Perhaps as a result, Clinton and, at times, Edwards kept Obama on the defensive for much of the two-hour debate's first half. Edwards had joined Obama in going after Clinton in earlier debates.  The candidates outlined plans to jumpstart the economy just as some economists say the nation may be sliding toward a recession. Watch the candidates explain how they'd stimulate the economy »  Clinton said her plan calls for a 90-day moratorium on home foreclosures, a five-year interest rate freeze and tax rebates that would average $650 to millions of Americans.  Obama also called for a tax rebate and additional help for senior citizens that would be delivered with their Social Security checks, and Edwards touted a plan that would begin creating environmentally friendly jobs within 30 days.  Obama provided one of the debate's most light-hearted moments when asked about Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison's comment that Bill Clinton -- Sen. Clinton's husband who, as president, was hugely popular with black voters -- was America's \"first black president.\"  \"I would have to investigate more of Bill's dancing ability and some of this other stuff before I accurately judged whether he was, in fact, a brother,\" Obama said to laughter from the audience and other candidates.  The debate unfolded as the nation observed the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth.  Hours after attending services marking the King holiday, all three candidates noted a desire to carry on the civil rights leader's legacy.  \"You have got a son of the South; you've got an African-American. You have a woman -- what better way to celebrate the legacy of Dr. King than to look at this stage right here tonight?\" Clinton said.  The first Democratic primary in the South, South Carolina is deemed crucial by the Democratic front-runners; voters go to the polls Saturday.  Clinton, who scored victories in the New Hampshire primary and Nevada caucuses, could use a win to paint herself as the clear front-runner going into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries.  Obama, who scored a win in the Iowa caucuses, would shift momentum to himself after Clinton's back-to-back wins while Edwards, a native of South Carolina, needs a win to shed the mantle of a perennial third-place finisher behind the other two.

        "article": "The House plans to vote within two weeks on a bill to limit appeal rights of Veterans Affairs Department employees, Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calf.) said Thursday.  Under a measure approved Wednesday by the House Veterans Affairs Committee, VA employees would have less time to challenge disciplinary actions, such as demotions or firings, and they could not appeal decisions beyond a first-level hearing official. Those changes would largely mirror limits imposed last year by a law that applies only to senior executives at the VA.  With about 300,000 employees, the VA accounts for about a seventh of the 2.1 million executive branch workforce outside the independent U.S. Postal Service. The measure is one of numerous proposals offered in response to the scandal over patient scheduling and care at the department, and employee organizations see such measures as a precedent for making similar changes government-wide.  “For years this administration has failed to hold executive agencies accountable, and in the VA that has had dire consequences. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs has been doing good work, and this bill is another step toward providing the care that our veterans deserve,” McCarthy said in announcing the intent to schedule the vote before the congressional August recess.  [After a year of frustration, new bill would make it easier to fire VA employees]  Under the bill, an employee would have only seven days to file an appeal at the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the hearing officer there would have only 45 days to issue a decision or else the agency action would take effect by default. The outcome would be final.  Standard federal employee appeal rights provide for 30 days to file an appeal, set a target of having a decision in 120 days with no provision for default judgments if there is no ruling by then, and allow the outcome of the hearing level to be appealed to the three-member merit board and then into federal court.  Also, under the bill, during the appeal, the hearing officer could not temporarily stay the agency’s action, and the employee would be ineligible for awards and could not be placed on non-working paid “administrative” leave. Further, newly hired VA employees would have to serve a probationary period of 18 months, rather than the standard 12 months.  The shortened appeal process for VA senior executives has been used in only a handful of cases since that law was enacted a year ago, and a court challenge is pending, asserting that the procedure denies due process rights.  “This bill would achieve nothing, while spreading the growing culture of fear plaguing VA employees,” National Federation of Federal Employees president William R. Dougan said in a statement last week. “The provisions in this bill would likely lead to a higher turnover of qualified healthcare professionals at the VA, ultimately resulting in worsening standards of care for the brave men and women that served our country – and all at a higher cost to the American taxpayer.”  The American Federation of Government Employees has made similar comments, saying that employees “would become at-will and subject to the whim of managers engaging in discrimination, retaliation and patronage.”  In a statement to the committee, the VA said the measure likely would “result in unintended consequences for VA, such as a loss of qualified and capable staff to other government agencies or the private sector.”  “In effect, the bill would create a new class of employees in the government, a ‘VA class,’” the department said. “These ‘VA class’ employees could be removed or demoted at the discretion of the Secretary, would receive fewer due process rights and abbreviated MSPB appeal rights in actions taken and would serve longer probationary periods than their peers at other government agencies. This will hinder VA efforts to make the ‘VA class’ of employee the very finest employees to serve our veterans and ensure that they timely receive the benefits and care to which they are entitled.  “By singling out VA employees, the legislation would dishearten a workforce dedicated to serving veterans and hurt VA’s efforts to recruit and retain high performing employees,” it said.",

        "article": "(CNN) – Texas Gov. Rick Perry will not participate in a debate moderated by real estate mogul Donald Trump and hosted by NewsMax, his campaign announced Thursday.  Perry's Communications Director Ray Sullivan said they \"respectfully declined the invitation for the December 27th debate\" citing Perry's \"traditional retail campaigning in the days and weeks leading up to the Iowa caucus\" as top priority for the longest-running Texas governor's presidential campaign.  Perry is one of four current presidential candidates that have visited with Trump, ostensibly seeking an endorsement from the businessman who made waves while flirting with a bid for the 2012 Republican nomination for president himself.  Trump has also met with GOP contenders including Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  Trump told CNN's Piers Morgan Wednesday, \"I know a lot of the moderators and some are wonderful, and some aren't, but I know the issues better than the moderators\" and touted ratings of his reality show as an additional incentive to participate.  Although the debate was also endorsed by 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, so far former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Gingrich are the only candidates who have agreed to attend. Perry now joins former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, and Romney, all of whom previously declined to participate.  Bachmann's campaign announced later on Thursday that she would be skipping the debate, as well.  And Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus took issue with Trump's role as moderator earlier in the day.  \"I think that having a successful businessman serving as a moderator has a lot of value but the issue here is whether the moderator should be a person who is still batting around the idea of running as an independent,\" Priebus asserted.  Because his role as Republican National Committee chairman requires him to raise questions about the debate moderated by businessman Donald Trump, Priebus said, \"I think it would be malpractice for me as an RNC chairman not to believe that's an issue.\"  Allowing that \"candidates can do whatever they want to do,\" Priebus asserted his \"concern of a moderator who is talking of running as an independent still being a moderator of a debate\" in an interview on Fox News.  \"I would have an issue with that and I would understand candidates who say, 'Look, I don't know if I want to avail myself where the moderator might be… still talking about potentially running as an independent candidate,'\" Priebus said.  \"I think that's a problem,\" he asserted.

The charges didn't directly accuse the Ramseys of killing their daughter, but alleged they permitted JonBenét to be placed in a dangerous situation that led to her death and it accused them of helping the killer, who has never been brought to justice.  The Ramseys were not officially indicted, however, because then-District Attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the documents to prosecute them. In 2008, then-Boulder District Attorney Mary Lacy exonerated the girl's parents and immediate family after DNA evidence pointed to an unknown male as JonBenét's killer.  JonBenét's body was found Dec. 26, 1996. She had been strangled and her skull was fractured.  JonBenét Ramsey's mother, Patsy, died of cancer in 2006.  Earlier this week, John Ramsey asked officials to release the entire grand jury record if the unprosecuted indictment was made public. However, the judge said transcripts of grand jury proceedings and evidence presented to it are not considered \"official action\" under the law governing criminal court records. He also said releasing such information could hurt other grand juries, whose work is secret.  An attorney representing John Ramsey, L. Lin Wood, said he's confident that no evidence in the grand jury case implicated the Ramsey family and the public should be able to see that for themselves.  \"Anything less than the release of all of the proceedings is a gross injustice to the Ramsey family,\" he said.  Former prosecutor and law professor Karen Steinhauser said grand juries sometimes hear evidence that won't be admitted during trial that can form the basis of indictments. But she added that prosecutors must have a good faith belief that they could prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt before pursuing charges.  \"I'm not sure that the release of this indictment is going to change the fact that there has not been able to be a prosecution and probably won't be able to be a prosecution,\" she told The Associated Press.  Some other experts have suggested over the years that investigators botched the case so thoroughly that it might never be solved.  Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner said the case remains open but it's not an active investigation. He predicted the indictment's release wouldn't change anything.  \"Given the publicity that's been out there, many people have formed their opinions one way or another,\" he said.  Hunter did not return phone messages left Thursday by The Associated Press in anticipation of the documents' release. Lacy also did not return a message seeking comment.

        "article": "LOS ANGELES – It has been a tumultuous two weeks for Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson, the three children of the late Michael Jackson. Their grandmother Katherine Jackson was reported missing, then located in Arizona with family members, but was still not in contact with them. On Monday, police were called to the kids' Calabasas home following reports of a physical altercation between various family members.  To top off the drama, on Wednesday a Los Angeles judge suspended Katherine’s guardianship and appointed Tito Jackson’s son TJ as the temporary caregiver for his young cousins.  Katherine Jackson told ABC News that she was “devastated” by the court’s decision, debunked the widespread rumors that she had been abducted and held against her will, and insisted that she was returning to Los Angeles to be reunited with her grandchildren immediately.  According to a source close to the family, serious damage has been done, and Michael Jackson's kids are mourning their dad, who died suddenly in 2009, more than ever.  “These people (family members) are all the people that their father tried so hard to keep them away from, and now the kids are caught in the middle of it. It is making them grieve Michael all over again,” the insider told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column. “Blanket in particular is very sensitive and very withdrawn, so this throws him into even more of a shell. Prince usually follows the lead of his sister Paris, who has a strong personality, and both are missing their dad terribly.”  Paris has taken to tweeting lyrics from her father’s songs to express her emotion, including a key phrase from “Will You Be There:” “Everyones taking control of me, it seems that the worlds got a role for me .. im so confused will u show to me you'll be there for me.” She also tweeted an instagram photo of herself proudly donning an MJ shirt.  Our source said the children will most likely move into TJ’s home nearby, to avoid a repeat of Monday’s debacle outside the Calabasas digs.  “The siblings keep referring to that house as their house but it is not. It’s the home for Paris, Prince and Blanket. At least if they are in TJ’s house, this can’t happen,” said the insider.  We’re also told that there is a high probability TJ will become more than just a temporary guardian.  “Jackie (son) and Trent (nephew) have done a really sound job in shielding [Katherine] from all this madness and the siblings’ desire to challenge the will and take control of the estate,” continued the insider. “This has to be overwhelming and heartbreaking for her, she doesn’t want to be in a big fight, but doesn’t know which way to turn… I will be surprised if she does get the children back.”  In a press conference following the judge’s guardianship ruling on Wednesday, an attorney for Katherine, Perry Sanders Jr. confirmed that paperwork would be filed to reinstate Katherine’s role immediately and that the court made it clear that her guardianship was suspended not on the grounds of wrongdoing, but because she was “out of pocket and paperwork could not be filed for her.” He also downplayed the escalating drama, and said it was a “misunderstanding” but “nothing like what media sources say.”  And while head-honcho Joe Jackson appears to have stayed away from the recent wind of family drama, it doesn’t sound like that will last long.  “Joe always said to the kids when they were young, and Michael actually used this in one of his songs, ‘throwing rocks and hiding your hand’ which is like causing problems and then pretending you had nothing to do with it,” added the source. “Joe in involved and knows how to pull strings from afar. We’ll see him emerge in all of this soon.”  A legal representative for Katherine Jackson did not respond to a request for further comment and a rep for Joe Jackson could not be reached.",

        "article": "FOR over a week Guatemala has been consumed with the court proceedings against Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, who led the country in the early 1980s, on charges of genocide. But he isn’t the only one on trial.  I have spent the past 15 years researching and writing about postwar justice in Guatemala. I am encouraged that, a decade and a half after peace accords ended 36 years of civil war, Guatemala is being given a chance to show the world how much progress it has made in building democracy. The trial gives the Guatemalan state a chance to prove that it can uphold the rule of law and grant its indigenous Mayan people, who suffered greatly under Mr. Ríos Montt, the same respectful treatment, freedoms and rights the rest of its citizens enjoy.  Still, the trial process could be the trickiest part. Given how weak the former general’s case is, the defense has already set its sights on appeal, on the grounds that Mr. Ríos Montt was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial — a denial of justice that the veteran defense team itself is supposedly trying to engineer.  Of course, win or lose, the case could still be a victory for the government if it gives voice to Mr. Ríos Montt’s Mayan victims. So far, the prosecution has gone to great lengths to do just that.  The prosecution opened the proceedings with testimonials from indigenous people, provided interpreters so they could speak in their native language (which, as one witness explained to me, is “so much easier because I know the words”) and is listening aghast to the unimaginable horrors they tell. Giving each individual the chance to speak in his or her own words, to be heard and affirmed, is a long overdue acknowledgment that Mayan lives demand protection.  The witnesses included a man testifying about how the Guatemalan Army under Mr. Ríos Montt killed his wife and two children, slashing his 5-year-old son’s face with a machete and smashing his toddler’s head. Another described how his pregnant sister was tied to a stake and burned alive, along with her child and six additional children. One witness, Nicolas Brito, told of seeing soldiers cut out and stack victims’ hearts on a table.  But it has become difficult to keep this up. The agenda is packed, patience will wear thin and the testimonies will begin to sound more or less the same, especially as listeners grow immune to hearing about the brutality they now find so shocking. Pressure will mount to quicken the pace through the remaining dozens of witnesses.  And it is becoming clear that, however shocking these stories are, and however cathartic the experience may seem at first glance, the trial process is ill suited to dignifying Guatemala’s victims. They are limited in what they can say in court; they must address only the specific question posed and limit their testimony to the suffering endured during the 17-month Ríos Montt regime.  That regime ended in 1983. But discrimination and violence against the indigenous Mayans continued long after, and persist today. The victims and their advocates have pleaded on the stand for the court to allow them to tell more, and they emerge from testifying dazed and frustrated. They blame themselves as much as anyone else; as one said: “We didn’t get to say what happened. Now no one will know.”  Then there is the adversarial nature of a criminal trial itself. The defense team’s case rests on debunking the prosecution’s case, establishing that indigenous victims were not innocent civilians, indiscriminately massacred by a racist state.  Cross-examination of the victims has become increasingly aggressive, humiliating and even traumatizing. Defense lawyers impugn Mayan witnesses, challenging the veracity of their testimonies, linking them to guerrillas — arguing that the indigenous victims were really subversives and that the army was merely trying to defend Guatemala against an insurgent threat.  Convicting Mr. Ríos Montt is not about sending one person to jail. Survivors are adamant that justice will not bring back their loved ones and that it can never be commensurate with the brutal massacres described in court. As one widow told me, “He is 86 years old, he got to live his whole life; my husband was just 18 when they killed him.”  Indeed, the real test may actually come after the verdict. Those implicated in wartime atrocities hope the trial will satisfy victims’ demands for retribution. Survivors, however, see the trial as opening up the floodgates of justice. They have a long list of perpetrators they want to see punished next.  Nor is the right to try perpetrators for war crimes the only right demanded by indigenous Guatemalans. Having mobilized for over a decade to bring Mr. Ríos Montt to justice, they take enormous pride in making the trial happen. They are emerging more confident and resolved to continue fighting to claim all the political, social and economic rights they are owed as Guatemalan citizens.  The contours of Guatemala’s democratic future are up for grabs, and the stakes have never been higher. While a failure to convict could be the greatest blow to the rule of law since the genocide itself, success has also never been so close within Guatemala’s reach.

        "article": "Remnants of a war fought decades ago continue to devastate innocent lives in Iran.  During the conflict with Iraq in the 1980s, millions of land mines were buried throughout Iran’s western border provinces. Despite efforts by government demining programs, an unknown amount of undetonated ordnance still litters the countryside.  “It’s been 30 years since the war ended, and it’s still taking lives and hurting the people,” said Arash Khamooshi, a photojournalist from Kurdistan, Iran, who grew up with adults constantly warning him about the countless mines scattered about, even in areas that had been playgrounds. That danger remains ever-present today: each year, more than 100 people are killed or maimed by land mines. Many are adults working around the borders of Kurdistan. Natural phenomena, including rain and landslides, have shifted mines closer to residential areas.  In 2013, Mr. Khamooshi learned that six children had been seriously injured after one of them triggered a land mine buried underneath a tree. The incident compelled him to document child victims of land-mine explosions. For the last two and a half years, Mr. Khamooshi has photographed a dozen children under the age of 10 whose lives were altered by land mines. All suffered trauma; some lost limbs, or even their lives.  “These kids had nothing to do with the war,” he said, “but they are being hurt by the aftermath of that war.”  He has dual motives for his continuing project. Mr. Khamooshi says he believes the photos will serve as effective warnings, particularly for children. More important, he hopes that bringing attention to these incidents will motivate the government, along with nonprofit organizations, to take necessary steps to make the country safer.  Mr. Khamooshi is no stranger to advocacy. In addition to his work for the Iranian Students News Agency, he volunteers in Tehran for Nikgaman Jamshid, a partner of the United States-based nongovernmental organization Moms Against Poverty. The organization builds schools and medical centers in poor and remote villages, so that fewer children will have to trek to neighboring villages along potentially treacherous paths. Many of the children killed or maimed by the blasts in Iran lived in areas with limited access to resources.  His photographs depict the young victims, wounded and recovering in hospital beds; some feature close looks at scars and deformities. Others show the children at home, or outside at a favorite playing spot; their injuries and amputations are not prominent, or even visible.  “I mostly want to show that they’re not being kids, like other kids living in other parts of Iran or around the world,” Mr. Khamooshi said. “They don’t have the same childhood as other kids. They live in dangerous areas.”  Mr. Khamooshi chose black-and-white to mute the graphic impact of blood and minimize the grisliness of certain injuries. Although he wants to raise awareness, he prefers to be restrained in order not to undermine his purpose with disturbing, graphic images. He needs to draw eyes to the horror, not avert them from it, if he hopes to spur change and prevent further tragedy.  “When they are disabled like that, it affects their future very deeply,” Mr. Khamooshi said of his subjects. “I wanted to show that the future for them is destroyed.”  Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

        "article": "Acrimony erupted in the US Senate over a major surveillance overhaul on Tuesday, hours before legislators are due to vote on moving it forward, as opponents labeled it a gift to terrorism.  The incoming Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, sharply warned that the USA Freedom Act, which, if passed, would be the first law to constrain the National Security Agency in decades, would cripple US intelligence against the Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria.  “This is the worst possible time to be tying our hands behind our back,” said McConnell, who will become majority leader in January.  “At the moment, we should not be doing anything to make the situation worse.”  The USA Freedom Act passed the House of Representatives in May and enjoys what the White House on Monday called its “strong support”. The first bill to reform government surveillance since Edward Snowden’s disclosures 18 months ago would divest the NSA of its ongoing daily collection of practically all Americans’ phone data.  Last week, the current Senate majority leader, Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, agreed to move forward with a vote on the bill. Should the Senate not pass it this week, the bill will likely die, leaving successor reform bills with an uncertain future in the next Congress – although all sides agree that reauthorizing a critical surveillance provision of the Patriot Act next year will be similarly uncertain.  Yet the new attack on the bill as a boon to terrorism could upend supporters’ already difficult legislative path to secure 60 votes for it. Few in the Senate are confidently predicting the outcome of the vote, scheduled for Tuesday evening, and privacy groups were encouraging their members to bombard their senators with phone calls.  While tech companies and most civil libertarian groups back the Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, few privacy advocates believe it would decisively move the US out of the era of dragnet surveillance. Only the domestic phone records database would be jettisoned, and even then the NSA would be able to acquire from telcos thousands of call records based on a single court order.  The NSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will still retain the power to warrantlessly search through the NSA’s vast collections of international communications information for Americans’ identifying information. No foreign nationals would receive greater privacy protections from the USA Freedom Act, nor would the NSA be prevented from undermining digital encryption.  While the Obama administration and the intelligence agencies have backed the bill, their support came only after officials and legislators met in August to loosen its provisions restricting what data the NSA will be permitted to collect. That effort, which followed passage in a critical House committee, cost the bill the support of tech firms and privacy groups, although most have rallied to the Senate version.  But the rise of Isis in Iraq and Syria has given new ammunition to the USA Freedom Act’s many critics in the Senate. Although the NSA has given up on the baseless argument that the US phone records dragnet has prevented domestic terrorist attacks, senators and ex-NSA officials are insisting doing away with it would be a gift to terrorism.  “We live in a dangerous world, and the threat by Isil only makes it more so,” McConnell said, using an alternative acronym for Isis. A similar argument, advanced by former NSA director and post-9/11 dragnet surveillance architect Michael Hayden, received prominent billing in the Wall Street Journal ahead of the vote.  Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, the major Senate advocate for the bill, rejoindered: “The NSA has had every single tool available while Isil built up its strength and not one single alarm bill rang, so let’s deal with the facts, not hypotheticals.”  Reid said on Tuesday that he would not object to an expected avalanche of amendments to the bill, coming from both NSA supporters and privacy advocates, all of which render its fate uncertain. Presidential hopeful Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, is considering an amendment strengthening the bill’s privacy and transparency measures.  One amendment that Reid supports is a holdover from the Stop Online Privacy Act (Sopa) that would criminalize the streaming of copyright-protected content, a provision strongly opposed by digital privacy advocates. Reid backs the measure, first reported by Techdirt, as a boon to his supporters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship MMA league. But he is said not to be prioritizing it ahead of other amendments more directly relevant to the USA Freedom Act, and is unlikely to offer it unless he first secures the votes for passage, another tall order.",

If pro athletes are not mentally pumped and focused on winning, they’re almost guaranteed to lose. But for those of us who aren’t pro athletes, no amount of encouragement from a trainer — or even an upcoming high school reunion — will help you achieve long-lasting results. But your attitude can.  Attitude, along with a motto, helps maintain a focus that is everlasting. It’s a simple theme that translates from pro sports to even the simplest children’s book. For example, in \"The Little Engine That Could,\" a long train gets stuck up a mountain only to be rescued by a much smaller engine who continuously repeats, “I think I can, I think I can.” Yes, the train was small, but mental prowess saved the day.

Altering your outlook will guarantee results if you stick with it. And if you get derailed from your goals of eating healthy and regularly working out (like many of us do), shrug it off and learn from your mistakes.

The only problem was I had just had a baby five months prior. I needed to motivate and fast! What did I do? I instantly took action.

        "article": "Home owners' associations with neighborhood watch progams will likely re-examine their operations in the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal, experts say.  The family of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old shot dead by Zimmerman, already has reached a reported seven-figure settlement with the homeowners association in the gated Florida community where Zimmerman lived. The payment, made before Zimmerman was acquitted, shows that civil liability doesn’t depend on proving a volunteer patrol member broke the law.  “I think a lot of associations that have neighborhood watch programs will now pay close attention to see if they have closely tailored policies and procedures,” said Miami-based attorney Robert Blanch, who specializes in representing community associations. “I also think they will be more cautious about endorsing them.”  - Robert Blanch, attorney for community associations  Zimmerman was accused of contributing to what became a deadly situation by reporting Martin was behaving suspiciously, then following him, at least for a short time, despite a dispatcher telling him, “We don’t need you to do that.”  Even if Zimmerman's Twin Lakes homeowners association had not officially sanctioned his efforts as a volunteer watch leader, the Martin family’s attorney was quick to note the association endorsed Zimmerman in a newsletter as the go-to person for residents who had been the victims of crime.  “It was almost like setting them up with a local guard,” Blanch said. “I would embrace a well-operated neighborhood watch program, but I wouldn’t go on record creating the appearance that it is a branch of the association. It should be an independent body acting on its own.”  Many neighborhood watch groups say they’ve always encouraged members to simply observe and report, serving as extra eyes and ears for the police.  “The neighborhood watch program volunteers are encouraged to report suspicious behavior,” Michelle Boykins, of the National Crime Prevention Council, told FoxNews.com. “We have taught them to reinforce the fact that they are not law enforcement.  Watch groups don’t need to change their rules, they just need to reinforce them, said Sgt. Denise Nestor, of the Pinellas County, Fla., Sheriff's Office.  “We have never endorsed people to patrol to the point where they are stopping people and confronting people,” she said. “They are supposed to call suspicious activity in right away. If you are going to be a witness, do so from a safe distance.”  However, Curtis Sliwa, founder and president of the Guardian Angels watch group and a New York radio personality, said his organization has no plans for changing the guidelines by which his members operate based on the Zimmerman trial.  “What needs to be understood in this is that he was out there solo on patrol,” Sliwa told FoxNews.com.“I have never heard of somebody just patrolling on their own. I don’t think the guidelines require any readjustment on anybody’s part.He was a guy on his own mission.That is what immediately suggests to me that he was a one-man warrior.”  Sliwa added that Guardian Angels do not carry weapons, are very identifiable in their red uniforms and defer to law enforcement without question.  Whatever the case, neighborhood watch groups have proven to be a valuable law enforcement tool , according to John Thompson, deputy executive director of the National Sheriff’s Association, which works with neighborhood watch groups around the country.  “We have 28,000 registered neighborhood watches,” Thompson said. “We stand by what we do. Things go wrong in every profession.I think neighborhood watch is going to stand as what it was built on.”",

The app takes the concept behind Path a step further. Instead of sharing personal updates within a small network, it’s a way to stay constantly connected with the smallest of networks — one other person.  Since launching in March, Pair has picked up about 220,000 users, $4.2 million in funding and a lawsuit over its name.  Until now, however, only couples who both had iPhones could use the social network for two. Those with Android-toting significant others couldn’t participate, even if they had an iPhone themselves.  Pair’s iPhone and Android apps are identical, down to a feature called “thumb kiss” that vibrates when both parties touch the same spot on the screen. Couples can also co-create drawings, maintain a joint to-do list and send a “thinking of you” message that works like a more thoughtful Facebook poke.

        "article": "BANGKOK—Fourteen-year-old Shanya Chokhlangtanakul recently woke up at 7 a.m. to perfect her makeup and dress up as her favorite cartoon character ahead of a recent animé convention here in Thailand. Her friend Nuttuwalai Prommayon wore an elf-like outfit she bought in Tokyo. Their creations for cosplay—a portmanteau of “costume” and “role-play”—were meticulous in their detail.  Then there are people like Anucha Saengchart. He is more likely to duct-tape some forks to his fists to mimic X-Men hero Wolverine and call it a day.  Welcome to the world of low-cost cosplay, where lavish costumes from famous cartoons or films are lampooned by devotees who prefer to use any old junk lying around their homes.  Mr. Anucha, 25, is the doyen of the lowbrow scene. Nothing is too mundane for his re-creations of well-known characters. He used a hot dog to role-play Pinocchio. His depiction of Elsa the Snow Queen from the hit film “Frozen” involves a bag of ice, an old curtain and a generous helping of talcum powder. On Facebook, he has nearly 300,000 fans—many of whom submit pictures of their own cheapskate attempts at role play. One of them placed a black cat on his head to strike a surprisingly effective Batman pose.  “If we look around, we can use anything to make us happy,” Mr. Anucha said. “Be creative, use your imagination.”  In some ways, Mr. Anucha’s parodies go back to the origins of the art.  Academics such as Michigan State University professor Theresa Winge and author Patrick Galbraith note that cosplayers in Japan often strike specific diorama-like poses instead of enacting elaborate role-playing scenes with other performers, as is more common in the U.S. and Canada. Literary critic Hiroki Azuma has argued that these static images reflect Japan’s fragmented history over the past century or so, punctuated by war and economic booms and busts.  Budget cosplay is also something of a backlash against the more serious players—who today prop up an industry that academics estimate to be worth roughly $330 million a year in Japan alone. The Akihabara neighborhood of Tokyo where Ms. Nuttuwalai purchased her elf outfit, for instance, has been transformed by the industry. Once a retail center for cheap electronics, Akihabara is now a thriving hub for the animé, manga and videogaming enthusiasts.  Some cosplayers such as Reika Arikawa and Americans Yaya Han and Meg Turney have become celebrities in their own rights, attending cosplay conventions around the world or attracting thousands of subscribers to their YouTube channels.  At the recent convention in Bangkok,hundreds of people dressed as their favorite characters, taking photos of each other and browsing through comics and other exhibitions. Many have spent hours perfecting their look. A squadron of Stormtroopers from the “Star Wars” movies marched through the hall at one point as conference-goers dressed as Power Rangers or characters from “Game of Thrones” nimbly stepped aside.  “I really identify with the character I play,” said Warisa Rochanapakdee, impeccably dressed in a black plastic cape to resemble Black Rock Shooter, a mysterious black-haired woman who roams a purgatorial world helping trapped souls find their way to heaven.  It is fair to say that Mr. Anucha’s vision is a little less dark.  The idea for his first low-cost cosplay creation came when he was filling in the night shift at the home for the elderly in Bangkok where he works as a caretaker. “There’s not much to do,” he said. So when he saw an old red towel and thought it might look like one of the red robes worn by the Spartan warriors in the film “300,” he tied it around his neck, flexed his biceps and set up his phone to take a photograph.  Since then, he has portrayed the Teletubbies (using towels), Davy Jones from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films (using carrots) and Raven from the “X-Men” movies (using duct tape— lots of duct tape).  One of Mr. Anucha’s better-known poses came after downing a few bottles of Thailand’s Leo beer, which has a picture of a snarling leopard on the label. Placing it near his camera, he stepped back a few paces with a favorite prop—a towel—wrapped around his waist and stared off into the middle distance. The result: An image that mimicked the boy and the tiger stranded in a lifeboat in the movie adaptation of “Life of Pi.”  His favorite subjects are Japanese characters from the futuristic Japanese “manga” genre of cartoons. He learned to draw the stylized cartoons himself growing up in Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand. Much of his time he still spends re-creating characters and scenes from “Dragon Ball Z,” in which the hero Goku defends Earth from various intergalactic villains.  “I still like all the bad guys in that one,” Mr. Anucha said.  He enjoys a broad following among many of the people attending the recent animé convention in Bangkok. Attendees from Japan and the Philippines had all heard of Mr. Anucha and enjoyed his work.  “That guy is awesome,” said one comic book publisher from Indonesia.  Mr. Anucha stayed away, though. He said he was too busy with his job at the nursing home. It might be just as well.  “He’s really funny and imaginative,” said the early-rising Ms. Shanya, giggling. “But maybe he shouldn’t come to the convention. Some of the people here, they take their cosplay pretty seriously.”  —Wilawan Watcharasakwet contributed to this article.  Write to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.com",

        "article": "The outbreak, with 5 people dead and 30 ill in six states, is thought to have been caused by a steroid drug contaminated by a fungus. The steroid solution was not made by a major drug company, but was concocted by a pharmacy in Framingham, Mass., called the New England Compounding Center. Compounding pharmacies make their own drug products, which are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  On Monday, federal inspectors at the New England center found a sealed vial of the steroid afloat with so much foreign matter that it could be seen with the naked eye, Food and Drug Administration officials said Thursday. Under the microscope, the particles were a fungus.  The drug has been recalled, the clinics that used it are scrambling to warn patients who might have been exposed and health officials are urging anyone feeling ill after a spinal steroid injection to contact a doctor quickly, especially for symptoms like severe headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, loss of balance or slurred speech. They are also urging doctors and hospitals to stop using any products made by the New England Compounding Center.  The pharmacy had shipped 17,676 vials of this potentially contaminated solution to 75 clinics in 23 states, according to Massachusetts and federal health officials.  The question is, Why? Why would pain clinics around the country rely on a pharmacy that mixes its own brand of unapproved drugs, especially for a delicate procedure like an epidural injection that has the potential — realized in these awful cases — to infect a patient’s nervous system?  There seems to be no one answer. Some doctors say compounding pharmacies offer specialty products or dosages not easily found elsewhere, or sometimes simply better prices than big drug companies.  But other physicians have reservations about using compounded pharmaceuticals.  Dr. Arthur S. Watanabe, an interventional pain specialist in Spokane, Wash., said the steroid for spinal injection was available from mainstream drug companies, and he could not understand why anyone would buy it from a compounding pharmacy.  Compounding has been called an ancient art, something practiced long before medicines were premixed and sealed in bubble packs. The practice goes on today, allowed by states and the federal government, but it is supposed to provide custom-made products for individual patients with special needs. It is frequently done in hospital pharmacies, and an estimated 2 to 3 percent of prescriptions in the United States are compounded prescriptions for individual patients, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists.  Pharmacies and regulators have struggled for years over what limits to set on the practice. Compounding has fallen between state and federal authorities, and the legal status of compounded drugs has never been clear. Compounding is tolerated by the F.D.A., as long as the pharmacy does not ship across state lines, mass produce drugs or use commercial scale equipment, said James H. Ruble, an assistant professor at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy.  But recent court cases, including one in federal court in Florida, have raised questions about the F.D.A.’s authority. In a case involving a compound-maker called Franck’s that was producing compounds for veterinary use, a judge ruled that the F.D.A. could not assume it had authority to regulate compounding pharmacies, Professor Ruble said. That case is on appeal.  Health officials worry about compounding because it has its risks. The pharmacies are not held to the same safety standards as big drug companies. The current outbreak is not the first time a steroid made by this type of pharmacy has caused fungal meningitis in people receiving spinal steroid injections. There were five similar cases, including a death, in 2002, all traced to one pharmacy in South Carolina that had been shipping its product to five states. Inspectors found contaminated vials and a complete lack of quality controls or sterility testing at the pharmacy.  In 2011, nine patients at an Alabama hospital died after receiving a feeding solution contaminated with bacteria, which had been prepared by a compounding pharmacy in Birmingham.  The New England center has had a long history of problems. Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said there had been three complaints registered against it, in 2002, 2003, and this year in March, when the potency of a compound used in eye surgery was questioned. Its ability to perform sterile processing was also questioned. State officials said it made dozens of medications, both injectable and noninjectable medicines as well as topical creams.  Officials said the center was starting with a powdered drug and mixing it with liquid to make a solution of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate that was ultimately used for spinal steroid injections.  But special care is needed in making drugs to be injected into the spine because of the seriousness of infections there, said Charles Leiter, the president of Leiter’s Compounding Pharmacy in San Jose, Calif.  “I try and stay away from drugs for the spinal column because if you make a mistake, they are dead,” Mr. Leiter said.  He added, “Taking a suspension and sterilizing it for use in the spinal column is very tricky.”  The New England center had also received warnings in the past from the F.D.A., though not about its steroid drugs. The earlier warnings had cautioned it against opening sterile vials of a cancer drug, Avastin, and repackaging the drug in smaller doses to be used to treat an eye disease. The agency had also warned the center against selling a pain cream that contained a powerful mixture of local anesthetics and that could be toxic and even cause heart problems if too much was rubbed into the skin.  Joe Cabaleiro, executive director of the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, said that the New England center had never applied for accreditation as meeting the industry’s quality standards — a voluntary move that only 162 out of about 3,000 compounding pharmacies have done so far.",

        "article": "Brain scientists have discovered that swerving around cars while simultaneously picking out road signs in a video game can improve the short-term memory and long-term focus of older adults. Some people as old as 80, the researchers say, begin to show neurological patterns of people in their 20s.  Cognitive scientists say the findings, to be published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature, are a significant development in understanding how to strengthen older brains. That is because the improvements in brain performance did not come just within the game but were shown outside the game in other cognitive tasks.  Further supporting the findings, the researchers were able to measure and show changes in brain wave activity, suggesting that this research could help understand what neurological mechanisms should and could be tinkered with to improve memory and attention.  The research âshows you can take older people who arenât functioning well and make them cognitively younger through this training,â said Earl K. Miller, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not affiliated with the research. âItâs a very big deal.â  The study highlights an emerging field in which researchers are trying to better define and even expand the limits of attention, which is seen as crucial to performance, memory and intelligence. Previous studies, done at the University of Rochester and focused more on young people, show that heavy use of certain off-the-shelf, intense shooting games can lead to improvements in a userâs ability to ignore distractions, and even learn.  Daphne Bavelier, who led that research, cautioned that the field was young, and that brain training could have side effects, like changing how the brain functions for the worse.  âWe know we can rewire the brain, but the challenge is how to do it properly,â she said. âWeâre in the primitive age of brain training.â  The significance of the research seems underscored by the title on the cover of the Nature issue reporting it: âGame Changer.â  Still, this generation of research came with other strong warnings from neuroscientists, who say it in no way proved that interacting with computers provided a surefire way to get smarter. Dr. Miller said most so-called brain games did not work as advertised, and the research shows that scientists should develop the games and objectively test their effectiveness.  But he and others also said these developments might offer some antidote to a problem often made worse by technology: limited focus because of constant stimulation and multitasking.  The latest research was the product of a four-year $300,000 study done at the University of California, San Francisco. Neuroscientists there, led by Dr. Adam Gazzaley, worked with developers to create NeuroRacer, a relatively simple video game in which players drive and try to identify specific road signs that pop up on the screen, while ignoring other signs deemed irrelevant.  One of the main early findings of the study reinforced just how challenging it is to multitask successfully, particularly as people age. People in their 20s experienced a 26 percent drop in performance when they were asked to try to drive and identify signs at the same time (rather than just identify the signs without driving). For people in their 60s to 80s, the performance drop was 64 percent.  But after the older adults trained at the game, they became more proficient than untrained people in their 20s. The performance levels were sustained for six months, even without additional training. Also, the older adults performed better at memory and attention tests outside the game.  âThat is the most grabbing thing here,â Dr. Gazzaley said. âWe transferred the benefit from inside the game to different cognitive abilities.â  Still, Dr. Gazzaley said the findings should not be taken to suggest that any activity or video game would improve cognition or lead to brain changes.  âThereâs a big leap between what we did here and the real world,â he said. If someone tries to multitask in everyday life, his performance could remain steady or be harmed by the divided attention. The tools people use, he said, must have scientific rigor behind them in the same way that training of great athletes requires a regimen.  The researchers created a second layer of proof by monitoring the brain waves of participants using electroencephalography. What they found was that in older participants, in their 60s to 80s, there were increases in a brain wave called theta, a low-level frequency associated with attention. When older subjects trained on the game, they showed increased bursts of theta, the very types of bursts seen regularly in people in their 20s.  âWe made the activity in older adultsâ prefrontal cortex look like the activity in younger adultsâ prefrontal cortex,â said Dr. Gazzaley, referring to a part of the brain heavily involved with attention.  David E. Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and an expert in attention and aging, said the use of brain measurement tools offered important evidence that something was changing inside the brain.  âThe public and even hard-nosed scientists have this tendency to accept conclusions through the mechanism of âseeing is believing,' â Dr. Meyer said. âThis provides some âseeing.â â",

        "article": "I have spent most of the past 15 years in the dark side of the rising sun. Until three years ago, I was a crime reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, and covered a roster of characters that included serial killers who doubled as pet breeders, child pornographers who abducted junior high-school girls, and the John Gotti of Japan.  I came to Japan in 1988 at age 19, spent most of college living in a Zen Buddhist temple, and then became the first U.S. citizen hired as a regular staff writer for a Japanese newspaper in Japanese. If you know anything about Japan, you'll realize how bizarre this is -- a gaijin, or foreigner, covering Japanese cops. When I started the beat in the early 1990s, I knew nothing about the yakuza, a.k.a. the Japanese mafia. But following their prostitution rings and extortion rackets became my life.  Most Americans think of Japan as a law-abiding and peaceful place, as well as our staunch ally, but reporting on the underworld gave me a different perspective. Mobs are legal entities here. Their fan magazines and comic books are sold in convenience stores, and bosses socialize with prime ministers and politicians. And as far as the United States is concerned, Japan may be refueling U.S. warships at sea, but it's not helping us fight our own battles against organized crime -- a realization that led to my biggest scoop.  I loved my job. The cops fighting organized crime are hard-drinking iconoclasts -- many look like their mobster foes, with their black suits and slicked-back hair. They're outsiders in Japanese society, and perhaps because I was an outsider too, we got along well. The yakuza's tribal features are also compelling, like those of an alien life form: the full-body tattoos, missing digits and pseudo-family structure. I became so fascinated that, like someone staring at a wild animal, I got too close and now am worried for my life. But more on that later.  The Japanese National Police Agency (NPA) estimates that the yakuza have almost 80,000 members. The most powerful faction, the Yamaguchi-gumi, is known as \"the Wal-Mart of the yakuza\" and reportedly has close to 40,000 members. In Tokyo alone, the police have identified more than 800 yakuza front companies: investment and auditing firms, construction companies and pastry shops. The mobsters even set up their own bank in California, according to underworld sources.  Over the last seven years, the yakuza have moved into finance. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission has an index of more than 50 listed companies with ties to organized crime. The market is so infested that Osaka Securities Exchange officials decided in March that they would review all listed companies and expel those found to have links with the yakuza. If you think this has nothing to do with the United States, think again. Americans have billions of dollars in the Japanese stock market. So U.S. investors could be funding the Japanese mob.  I once asked a detective from Osaka why, if Japanese law enforcement knows so much about the yakuza, the police don't just take them down. \"We don't have a RICO Act,\" he explained. \"We don't have plea-bargaining, a witness-protection program or witness-relocation program. So what we end up doing most of the time is just clipping the branches. . . . If the government would give us the tools, we'd shut them down, but we don't have 'em.\"  In the good old days, the yakuza made most of their money from sleaze: prostitution, drugs, protection money and child pornography. Kiddie porn is still part of their base income -- and another area where Japan isn't acting like America's friend.  In 1999, my editors assigned me to cover the Tokyo neighborhood that includes Kabukicho, Japan's largest red-light district. Japan had recently outlawed child pornography -- reluctantly, after international pressure left officials no choice. But the ban, which is still in effect, had a major flaw: It criminalized producing and selling child pornography, not owning it. So the big-money industry goes on, unabated. Last month's issue of a widely available porn magazine proclaimed, \"Our Cover Girl Is Our Youngest Yet: 14!\" Kabukicho remains loaded with the stuff, and teenage sex workers are readily available. I've even seen specialty stores that sell the underwear worn by teenage strippers.  The ban is so weak that investigating yakuza who peddle child pornography is practically impossible. \"The United States has referred hundreds of . . . cases to Japanese law enforcement authorities,\" a U.S. embassy spokesman recently told me. \"Without exception, U.S. officials have been told that the Japanese police cannot open an investigation because possession is legal.\" In 2007, the Internet Hotline Center in Japan identified more than 500 local sites displaying child pornography.  There's talk in Japan of criminalizing simple possession, but some political parties (and publishers, who are raking in millions) oppose the idea. U.S. law enforcement officers want to stop the flow of yakuza-produced child porn into the United States and would support such a law. But they can't even keep the yakuza themselves out of the country. Why? Because the national police refuse to share intelligence. Last year, a former FBI agent told me that, in a decade of conferences, the NPA had turned over the names and birthdates of about 50 yakuza members. \"Fifty out of 80,000,\" he said.  This lack of cooperation was partly responsible for an astonishing deal made with the yakuza, and for the story that changed my life. On May 18, 2001, the FBI arranged for Tadamasa Goto -- a notorious Japanese gang boss, the one that some federal agents call the \"John Gotti of Japan\" -- to be flown to the United States for a liver transplant.",

        "article": "A ripe mound of earth, festering with sickly flowers and garbage, rises from the upstairs stage of the Flea Theater these days. Audience members in the front row for “Wolf in the River” — which opened on Monday night in a highly intimate in-the-round production — could easily lean over and rub their faces in the muck, which may well be the symbolic intention of this play’s creator, Adam Rapp.  But mostly, this squalid pile exists as a place for an enthusiastic tribe of young theater folk — members of the Bats, the Flea’s resident acting company — to get dirty, histrionic and, on occasion, naked. It must be said that they seem to be having just as good a time doing so as Mr. Rapp apparently had writing and directing this tall and bloated tale of nasty doings on the banks of a cannibalistic river.  Just so you know, we, the audience, are that river (as we’re told early on). In the world of Mr. Rapp, everybody gets to be a metaphor.  Mr. Rapp, whose “Red Light Winter” was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is an uncommonly prolific and profuse playwright who wallows shamelessly and happily in excess. No bare-bones minimalism for this advocate of all things purple and lurid, who apparently never met a poetic image or theatrical shock tactic he couldn’t find a use for.  Most of his work involves disaffected and dysfunctional Americans perpetrating gory acts of violence upon one another in environments that embrace both blighted urban apartments and affluent suburban homes. For “Wolf in the River,” he has ventured into Dogpatch territory, where — it may surprise you to learn — disaffected and dysfunctional Americans perpetrate gory acts of violence upon one another.  This particular group of feral young things belongs to an indigent tribe ruled by the tyrannical and sadistic Monty Mae Maloney (Xanthe Paige), a woman with a smokin’ body and Beyoncé moves. Monty, who keeps the members of her clan solvent by selling their plasma to blood banks, wields a crocodile-headed cane to squelch any signs of rebellion.  Pity, then, poor li’l Tana Weed (a very good, very brave Kate Thulin), a wistful 16-year-old with dreams of crossing the river that keeps her from her true love, Debo (Maki Borden), a skiff-riding swain with a passion for old cars. She can’t expect any assistance from her brother, Dothan (William Apps), a veteran who returned mute and deranged from the war in Afghanistan, where he committed unspeakable atrocities.  Filling out the surrogate family portrait are Aikin (Karen Eilbacher), Monty’s trusted right hand, who eats the fantastical, senses-numbing flowers that grow in abundance, and the simple-minded Pin (Mike Swift), first seen copulating with a blowup sex doll.  A scene from Adam Rapp’s play at the Flea Theater.  Tana’s story is narrated and annotated by the bare-chested Man (Jack Ellis), also known as the Wolf, who occasionally takes on the role of Monty’s sedentary mama, Dumptruck Lorna. The Man is prone to flights of savage lyricism. A typical example: “The moon is a sickled leopard’s tooth pinned to obsidian, its light silvering the violent undulations scoring the skin of your unforgiving water.”  Or, if you prefer a folksier approach: “Time is a tricky old sow, ain’t she?” Or Aikin’s description of swimming in the river: “The drum fish was drummin’, and the catfish had they hackles up, and them cottonmouths was slitherin’ with the quickness.” It is easy to imagine “Wolf” as a collaboration between Tennessee Williams and Erskine Caldwell, both deep in their cups.  The artery-clogging prose is enlivened by the vivacious staging, which makes fecund use of Arnulfo Maldonado’s set. (Michael Hili and Hallie Elizabeth Newton did the barely there, recycled-looking costumes, and Masha Tsimring, the creepy lighting.)  The ensemble, which includes a backup group called the Lost Choir that roams the audience like the walking dead in search of brains, periodically breaks into haunting bucolic song or choral sighs and whispers. Ms. Paige’s wicked Monty leads a pop-siren production number that suggests a down-market variation on a Super Bowl halftime show.  The production also makes dexterous and multifarious use of Monty’s cane, a derelict refrigerator and, for the climax, a thick suspended rope. Warning: The cast members will be very much in your midst throughout, sharing their glee at the chance to act up a hillbilly storm beneath that ol’ sickled leopard’s-tooth moon.

        "article": "The ad industry is creating a blacklist for Web sites associated with online ad fraud, a move meant to spread the word about bad actors and help crack down on an activity that is costing marketers.  The Trustworthy Accountability Group, an industry organization that’s attempting to clean up online advertising, announced the new program on Monday.  The group unveiled plans to create and maintain a list of Web domains that have been associated with so-called “non-human traffic,” or computer programs used to trick advertisers into paying for ads that are never actually displayed to real consumers.  The plan is for companies in the industry to pool their knowledge about suspicious domains and traffic to create a “Fraud Threat List,” which companies can use to help filter bad traffic from all of their systems.  A pilot of the program is already underway with involvement from AOL, Yahoo, Facebook and video ad firm SpotXchange. TAG’s interim chief executive, Mike Zaneis, said he expects all major companies in the industry to participate.  “We’re trying to make it as hard as possible for criminals to profit by sharing intelligence,” Mr. Zaneis said.  Some industry executives question the effectiveness of this type of blacklist approach, however. Bad actors can move their operations to new domains relatively easily and quickly if they’re caught, they say.  Mr. Zaneis admitted fighting fraud is “an arms race,” but said he’s confident this effort will help address the problem.  “The list will be as automated as possible to update on short turnaround. We’re confident we can keep pace with criminal practices,” he said.  Specific details of the program are still being worked out, but TAG plans to develop systems and safeguards to ensure domains are not incorrectly placed on the threat list. There will also be a process by which companies can dispute their inclusion on it.  The list itself will be made available to ad networks and exchanges, publishers, and ad technology companies.  TAG is an initiative created by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A’s), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) to attack ad-supported piracy, advertising fraud, malware, and other challenges in the digital advertising supply chain.  ______________________________________________________ For the latest media, marketing and advertising news, follow us on Twitter: follow @wsjCMO Subscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox.",

The executive branch is institutionally and constitutionally better suited to make decisive judgments, utilize the array of American powers and rally the country. But in the case of this president, it’s Congress that is leading while the administration wallows, confers and spins.  Protesters opposed to the former Ukrainian leadership warm themselves next to a fire in Kiev on Wednesday. (Emilio Morenatti/Associated Press)  With the power of the purse, the House is trying to shore up Ukraine. A leadership aide explains that in a proposal put forth Tuesday, the United States would expand existing loan guarantees to Ukraine by adding it to the list of countries eligible for such guarantees. This would provide loan guarantees with no new funding. Rory Cooper, communications director for Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), explains, “Clearly there is a dire situation unfolding, so the House is moving as quickly as possible to provide the administration with authority to issue loan guarantees for Ukraine.” It is remarkable, when you think about it, that in a dire situation the House is pushing the executive branch to act. Power abhors a vacuum, I suppose.  Meanwhile, the Senate Republican Policy Committee has put out a list of suggested steps the United States can take:  Democrats — who stoked the anti-war flames while President George W. Bush was struggling to win the Iraq War — are shocked, just shocked, to hear Republicans criticize a president. Despite the administration’s extraordinary display of incompetence in managing Russia, all they can manage to do is circle the wagons around a faltering president. But unlike the Democrats in 2006, Republicans are trying to help the president “win” and not demand he retreat and fail.  Republicans — in concert with some Democrats, including those on the House Foreign Affairs Committee — are doing precisely what the loyal opposition should do: Identify the challenge, propose its own solutions and implore the other party to get on board.

It’s a playful spirit that she had even as a kid.  “I never got suspended [in school], but I definitely went to detention a couple times for talking, which is not a surprise,” says RaeLynn, adding that in fifth grade she created a rather ingenious plan for passing notes in class without getting caught. “I found this highlighter and I took out all of the stuff in the highlighter and you could just screw it, and screw it off, screw it on. And so I would put notes in the highlighter … we thought we were so fly in fifth grade, but we really weren't.”  RaeLynn has been buzzing around country radio promoting her debut single \"God Made Girls\" with a spunk and spark that is getting everyone excited. Fans can hopefully look for an album from the rising star in the next year.  Watch RaeLynn Perform \"God Made Girls\"",

Which category does Marcus Stroman’s sixth-inning offering on Monday night in Baltimore fall under?  If you didn’t see it, the Toronto Blue Jays rookie fireballer unleashed a first-pitch fastball high and back of the head of Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph, prompting a warning to both teams from umpire Ted Barrett.  In the fifth inning, Joseph was blocking the plate when the Blue Jays’ Jose Reyes slid in for Toronto’s second run. As a result, Joseph stepped on Reyes’s left hand as he turned to make the tag, prompting some harsh words from the Jays shortstop.  After striking out the side in the sixth, Stroman walked off the mound and had some words for those in the Baltimore dugout.  Marcus Stroman buzzes Caleb Joseph, then chirps the Orioles bench. http://t.co/klSAPB0g5y  After the game, Stroman told reporters it wasn’t a purpose pitch.  “It was a fastball in that just kind of slipped in my hand,” he said. “I’m a little excited and tried to get out of the inning. It’s possibly my last hitter and I tried to execute a fastball in.”  Wow. Deserves suspension RT \"@HardballTalk: Marcus Stroman should be suspended for throwing at Caleb Joseph’s head http://t.co/l23RusTjLF”  @HardballTalk Damn Right and it should be a long suspension. #NotRight throwing at someone head.  Stroman, who allowed five runs on nine hits over six innings, admitted he struggled with his fastball command all evening.  It’s completely absurd to throw at a guy, but I can’t help but love Marcus Stroman defending Jose Reyes and throwing behind Caleb Joseph.  Bush League move from Marcus Stroman and the Jays throwing at Caleb Joseph's head  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter, at his post-game news conference, said Stroman’s actions were “borderline professionally embarrassing.”  The baseball world isn’t taking kindly to pitches up and in on hitters, especially in the wake of last week’s gruesome injury to Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton.  It wouldn’t be a surprise if Ubaldo Jimenez, the Orioles’ scheduled starter for Tuesday night’s game, or another Baltimore pitcher push a Toronto batter off the plate.

READERS OF \"Cost of Freedom Recap\" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.  NEW SIGNS VOTERS ARE LOSING TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AMID NSA SCANDAL  CHARLES PAYNE: I think it (government disapproval]) will halt a big government agenda. Trust is the cornerstone of everything. Trust is the cornerstone of any kind of success-business, family, marriage, government. You've got to believe in a government. Young people particularly believed in this president. You know...inadequate answers for NSA, IRS, and Benghazi. And now the idea that you use these organizations as political tools? It's amazing. So I think there's a lot of optimism on Wall Street and other places that maybe this will put the kibosh on some of these anti-business things that the President is pushing through.  DAGEN MCDOWELL: I have no expectation of privacy online, but we have an entire generation of people who are growing up using social media. And I think that they are utterly shocked by this National Security Agency collection of phone records in a way that older generations are not. I think that if you have people reacting that way to bigger government that will ultimately be a good thing because maybe those people in Washington will be forced to shrink it. I don't think young people think the government will be there for them when they're retired, like in the form of Social Security.  GARY KALTBAUM: And just remember a campaigner Obama came out and said that he wasn't going to do what George W. Bush was doing as far as wire-tapping. And all of a sudden, he's taking it to the 100th power, and this is all news. This was done undercover. Nobody knew about it. Now, all of a sudden, boom. The poll numbers come out, they're way down, and I want to see that because I want less government. And the good news is I think this bucks up Republicans to maybe fight a little harder against him. Poll numbers do matter.  JULIE ROGINSKY: I think this has gone to a completely absurd extreme, and I was very vocal about the fact that Democrats who trashed George W. Bush for doing it are hypocrites. Now, they're not going to trash Obama for doing the same thing. At the end of the day, I think there is no expectation of privacy. There shouldn't be. Those of us who were against the Patriot Act 10 years ago were fearful of this happening.  NO WHITE HOUSE ACTION ON KEYSTONE PIPELINE AS DRIVERS PAY MORE AT THE PUMP IN 2013  GARY KALTBAUM: That 20 cents (rise in gas prices in 2013) is equal to about $28 billion out of the consumers' pockets and out of the economy, so it matters a lot. The bottom line is that I'm a big believer in psychology of the markets. If the President comes out and does something about this and goes after the Shale-by the way, there's about a trillion barrels there, the psychology of the markets change, prices come down, and everybody's happy.  DAGEN MCDOWELL: We're already getting Shale oil. We had the biggest increase in the world last year in oil production in this country-more than a million barrels a day added in oil production in the United States because of Shale oil. We do need more pipelines. That's one of the reasons that you have not seen this translate into a decrease in gas prices, in part because you need the infrastructure. You need the pipelines from the oil fields to the refineries.  CHARLES PAYNE: America has become accustomed to celebrating mediocrity. Let's face it. Under George Bush, $3.50 was the worst thing in the world. Under President Obama, it's great news. Oh, and by the way, a couple hundred thousand jobs, $3.50 gas.... All of that is mediocrity, but we celebrate it.  JULIE ROGINSKY: You guys are complaining that Obama wants to raise fuel standards, but actually, that's pretty good news for gas prices. That tank of gas will go a lot longer, and I think that's pretty good. I'm not somebody who's opposed to the Keystone Pipeline. I'm not knee-jerk about that, but we do know that it's not really going to affect the price of gas. We can sit here and pretend that it's going to be some massive panacea, that gas will go back to $1.50 a gallon, but it's not going to. It might marginally affect it a couple of cents.  REPORT: COLLEGE LOAN DEFAULT RATES HIGHER THAN GRADUATION RATES AT 265 SCHOOLS  GARY KALTBAUM: They're going into debt for students to go into debt. Until we change the cost, I don't think it gets better. Colleges are raising prices seven percent a year. It's an obscene amount, and until that changes, we're at a trillion dollars in debt. It's only going to get worse.  CHARLES PAYNE: Unfortunately, colleges, Hollywood...they're liberal groups that can do anything they want. They can say anything they want. They can be hypocrites. And they can raise their tuitions or salaries 600 percent over inflation and can't be touched.  DAGEN MCDOWELL: Student loans and colleges are just like the housing market. Too much cheap and easy money to get from the government... these government back loans. And that's why tuition rates have skyrocketed over years. Hopefully, it changes. Maybe not.  JULIE ROGINSKY: I think they're going into debt so that students go into debt. I don't know what the solution is. I think it's obscene. These diploma mills are horrible, and they're basically gauging students. So a lot of these colleges need to be regulated a lot better because they're for-profit. They exist to make themselves rich, not to educate students.  CHARLES PAYNE: United Rentals, Inc. (URI)  GARY KALTBAUM: Ford Motor Company (F)",

        "article": "Wednesday, January 26th 2011, 4:00 AM  President Obama faced one of the trickiest tasks in State of the Union memory Tuesday night: convincing the country he's serious about attacking $14 trillion in debt - while putting forward ambitious plans to spur job growth.  He framed it as \"our generation's Sputnik moment,\" but cutting the deficit doesn't just take imagination, money and a can-do spirit.  It requires something much more rare, especially in Washington: political courage.  Only time will tell if Democrats and Republicans are truly prepared to get in the ring with the sumo wrestler that is the retiring baby boom generation - and take down its rising health care and retirement costs.  As far as speeches go, this one did the job. Obama was optimistic, as we expect our Presidents to be even in troubled times.  He was bipartisan, continuing the clear swing to the center that began after the midterm elections.  And he weaved in enough specifics to give Americans hungry for hope something to latch on to - investments in roads, schools and scientific research.  These investments may not deliver jobs next week, next month or maybe even next year.  But they'll create fresh confidence that the economy is headed in the right direction, which most Americans doubt.  Which brings us to Obama's last major subject: confronting the debt. No matter how fast we try to run in the new global marathon, as our IOUs grow, they'll start to feel like cinder blocks on our ankles.  The five-year domestic discretionary spending freeze and pledge to veto all earmarks are a start. It would be silly to ridicule them, because they represent concrete progress from where we are today.  But as Obama himself acknowledged, that's not where the money is. It's in SocialSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid.  In these areas, the President was vague - but he at least opened the door to some of the bold proposals recommended by his bipartisan deficit and debt commission.  He called for tax simplification.  He urged consolidation of government agencies.  He championed the use of technology to increase transparency and streamline operations.  It all sounded well and good - rein in government while doing more to create jobs and innovate.  Can we do it, or will the details derail any deal?  For the millions of jobless Americans, and the millions more who get a queasy feeling in their stomachs every time they think about the rising debt, winning the future can wait.  They're still worried we might wind up losing the present.  Josh Greenman's column appears on NYDailyNews.com on most Fridays and occasionally in the print edition of the Daily News.

        "article": "BRUSSELS -- President Obama said Thursday that he makes \"no apologies\" for freeing five Taliban commanders in exchange for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.  \"We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated and we were deeply concerned about, and we saw that we had an opportunity and we seized it,\" Obama said. \"And I make no apologies for that.\" He made the remarks during a news conference in Brussels with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama is meeting with Cameron and other leaders at a Group of Seven summit expected to be dominated by discussion of the crisis in Ukraine.  Obama said his administration had discussed the \"possibility that something like this might occur\" with Congress. \"But because of the nature of the folks we were dealing with and the fragile nature of these negotiations, we felt it was important to go ahead and do what we did. And we’re now explaining to Congress the details of how we moved forward,\" the president said.  President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron hold a joint press conference during the G7 Summit at the European Council in Brussels, on June 5, 2014. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)  The White House ratcheted up its efforts to defend the swap Wednesday, giving U.S. senators a classified briefing on the mission. Members of Congress have sharply criticized the administration for swapping Taliban commanders in exchange for Bergdahl's freedom. Five Taliban commanders were released from Guantanamo Bay in a deal with the government of Qatar.  The deal stipulates that the Qatari government place a one-year travel ban on the men, but many in Congress have criticized the agreement because it could allow the men to again take up arms. Obama said Tuesday in Warsaw that \"recidivism\" could be possible.  “Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,” Obama said in a news conference with Poland’s president. “There’s a certain recidivism rate that takes place.”  During the session, a number of senators watched a video of Bergdahl recorded in December 2013. Senators said Bergdahl looked sickly in the briefing and stammered as he spoke. People familiar with the briefing said U.S. intelligence officials pointed out evidence of Bergdahl's declining health in the video.  “It did not look good,” Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said about Bergdahl’s condition. “I would definitely think that it would have had an emotional impact on the president when he saw it.”  Many remain critical of the swap.  “I think we should have made efforts to bring Bergdahl home, but this price is higher than any in history,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who as a Navy pilot was held captive in North Vietnam for six months longer than Bergdahl’s time with the Taliban.  The effort to bring back Bergdahl started in 2011 and culminated with the handover this weekend. The Taliban released a video of the soldier’s transfer, which occurred in the known Haqqani stronghold of Khost province.  In the clip, Bergdahl, dressed in traditional Afghan clothes, his head shaved, awaits a Black Hawk helicopter, surrounded by about 18 Taliban fighters. He is handed over to U.S. Special Operations forces, who pat him down for weapons and explosives before taking him away.  “Don’t come back to Afghanistan,” one of the Afghan men is heard saying to Bergdahl. “If you come back, you will not leave alive.”  Obama said Bergdahl's release had nothing to do with politics, but is part of a basic American principle that the country doesn't leave behind its soldiers. Obama said this has, since the founding of the nation, sometimes meant prisoner swaps.  \"With respect to how we announced it, I think it was important for people to understand that this is not some abstraction. This is not a political football. You have a couple of parents whose kid volunteered to fight in a distant land who they hadn't seen in five years and weren't sure whether they'd ever see again.And as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, I am responsible for those kids,\" Obama said.  Bergdahl's parents joined Obama in the Rose Garden Sunday to announce that their son had been freed.  Obama recalled getting letters from parents who told him that if he sent their child to war, they wanted to be sure that the child was well taken care of.  \"I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents and that the American people understand that this is somebody’s child and that we don’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back,\" Obama said.

        "article": "When the holiday season rolls around, the only thing more exciting than tearing into that pile of gifts on Christmas morning is that feeling when Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Gift Guide is revealed. The team at her lifestyle empire never settle for ordinary. Forget the predictable bath salts and expected socks, they push the boundaries to places that we didn’t think existed. Case in point: Did you know driving lessons from Formula 3 racers were a thing? (Neither did we.) Luckily Paltrow + Co. did not disappoint this year and we broke down their craziest, funniest, most expensive gifts to get on your wish list.  The brand organized the 2016 gift guides into 10 different categories, including items for the “thinker,” the “lover” and a list of “ridiculous” products that somehow managed to outdo their craziest picks from years past. We combined the most shocking fashion and beauty finds to help get your holiday shopping underway.  Good news if you find yourself in a Secret Santa exchange with Kendall Jenner (who famously loves showing off her nipples), because she’ll thoroughly appreciate this Anissa Kermiche “Rubies Boobies” necklace. Or for a more safe-for-work (but by no means less exorbitant) gift, give a $6,850 customizable pet pendant from Irene Neuwirth to show your favorite animal lover that you admire them as much as they adore their pets. There’s no friend who wouldn’t freak over a gift from Alexander McQueen, but a skull umbrella seems a bit frivolous when the first big gust of wind destroys it faster than they unwrapped it. But practicality is not what the holidays are all about at Goop, which is why a pricey $595 silk kimono from Fleur du Mal comes highly recommended.  As far as beauty is concerned, Goop encourages getting all your friends on a fluoride-free dental regimen with this $114-a-tube Rennou-based Theodent toothpaste. (#Reasonable.) They also suggest to upgrade your boyfriend’s stocking from drugstore razors to $2,500 Oneblade Collector’s Edition. And forget a gift card to the spa, bring the spa to your loved one with their very own Clearlight Infrared Sauna for $2,295.  RELATED PHOTOS: A Guide to Shopping for Every Impossible Person in Your Life  While the gift guide does include reasonably-priced items like a cute Pop & Suki camera bag ($195) and Sarah Chloe jewelry ($148), what we really want (no, need) to focus on are some non-fashion related items that were too amazing to miss. We could never forgive ourselves if we didn’t highlight the “sexy” Seletti Toilet Paper Little Butt table to give your loved one (yes, this was in the “Lover” gift guide). Or point out that you can give a $8,300 Groovy Yurt, to… all the people you know who love yurts. A driving lesson is always practical, especially from the Formula 3 Racing School for a mere $1,495-$5,995. But our absolute favorite, is the late actor Dennis Hopper’s personal record collection for… $150,000.

        "article": "If the House and Senate can't agree on a government funding bill by Sept. 30, the federal government will shut down. And, right now, the House and Senate can't agree on a bill. They're wrangling over Obamacare.  The photograph is cleverly shot to make it look like the gates of the federal government are literally closing. Neat, eh? (The Washington Post)  So... it's time to start thinking about what a federal government shutdown would actually look like.  Not all government functions would simply evaporate come Oct. 1 — Social Security checks would still get mailed, and veterans' hospitals would stay open. But many federal agencies would shut their doors and send their employees home, from the Department of Education to hundreds of national parks.  Here's a look at how a shutdown would work, which parts of the government would close, and which parts of the economy might be affected.  Wait, what? Why is the federal government on the verge of shutting down?  The fiscal crises will continue until morale improves. (Scott Applewhite/AP)  Short answer: There are wide swaths of the federal government that need to be funded each year in order to operate. If Congress can't agree on how to fund them, they have to close down. And, right now, Congress can't agree on how to fund them.  To get a bit more specific: Each year, the House and Senate are supposed to agree on 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal agencies and set spending priorities. Congress has become really bad at passing these bills, so in recent years they've resorted to stopgap budgets to keep the government funded (known as \"continuing resolutions\"). The last stopgap passed on March 28, 2013, and ends on Sept. 30.  In theory, Congress could pass another stopgap this week. But the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House are at odds over what that stopgap should look like. The House version included an item that would defund Obamacare. The Senate's bill will almost certainly strip that provision out. So... we have a standoff.  Does a shutdown mean everyone who works for the federal government has to go home?  Nope. The laws and regulations governing shutdowns separate federal workers into \"essential\" and \"non-essential.\" (Actually, the preferred term nowadays is \"excepted\" and \"non-excepted.\" This was tweaked in 1995 because \"non-essential\" seemed a bit hurtful. But we'll keep things simple.)  The Office of Management and Budget recently ordered managers at all federal agencies to conduct reviews to see which of their employees fall into each of these two categories. If a shutdown hits, the essential workers stick around, albeit without pay. The non-essential workers have to go home after a half-day of preparing to close shop.  Which parts of government stay open?  Air traffic control stays open. (Jim Weber/AP)  There are a whole bunch of key government functions that carry on during a shutdown, including anything related to national security, public safety, or programs written into permanent law (like Social Security). Here's a partial list:  -- Any employee or office that \"provides for the national security, including the conduct of foreign relations essential to the national security or the safety of life and property.\" That means the U.S. military will keep operating, for one.  -- Any employee who conducts \"essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property.\" So, for example: Air traffic control stays open. So do all emergency medical care, food-safety inspections, border patrol, federal prisons, law enforcement, emergency and disaster assistance, overseeing the banking system, operating the power grid, and guarding federal property.  -- Agencies have to keep sending out benefits and operating programs that are written into permanent law or get multi-year funding. That means sending out Social Security checks and providing certain types of veterans' benefits.  -- All agencies with independent sources of funding remain open, including the U.S. Postal Service and the Federal Reserve.  -- Members of Congress can also stick around, since their pay is written into permanent law. However, many congressional staffers may not get paid without specific appropriations.* Many White House employees may also have to go without pay.  Do these \"essential\" employees who keep working get paid?  They don't get a paycheck during the shutdown. They do, however, receive retroactive pay if and when Congress decides to fund the government again.  So which parts of government actually shut down?  Closed! Well, unless Arizona wants to pay to operate it. (Ron Watts / Corbios)  Everything else, basically. It's a long list, and you can check out in detail which activities the agencies are planning to halt in these memos from 2011 — the last time a government shutdown looked imminent.  Alternatively, we can see what happened in 1995 and 1996, the last two times the federal government actually shut down for a few weeks. These examples all come from a recent Congressional Research Service report, and they're only meant to be illustrative — a shutdown in 2013 could well differ in the details :  Health. The National Institutes of Health stopped accepting new patients for clinical research and stopped answering hotline calls about medial questions. The Centers for Disease Control stopped monitoring disease.  Law enforcement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms stopped processing applications for firearms and alcohol. The federal government stopped work on about 3,500 bankruptcy cases as well as a number of child-support cases. The Border Patrol put a hold on hiring 400 new agents.  Parks and museums. The National Park Service closed 368 sites, such as Yosemite National Park in California. All told, some 7 million visitors were turned away. (One big exception was the south rim of the Grand Canyon, which stayed open only because Arizona agreed to pick up the tab.)  Regulatory agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency closes down almost entirely during a shutdown. So do certain financial regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Although corporations can still file documents like 10Ks through automated systems, there's no one around to scrutinize the papwerwork.  (Small parts of) Social Security. During the last shutdown, the Social Security Administration was able to keep on enough employees to make sure the checks kept going out. But the agency didn't have enough staff to do things like answer phone calls or help recipients who needed to change addresses. So some disruptions are possible.  Visas and passports. During the shutdown, around 20,000 to 30,000 applications from foreigners for visas went unprocessed each day. The State Department also had to let some 200,000 applications from Americans for visas gather dust.  Veterans. Although some key benefits continued and the VA hospitals remained open, \"multiple services were curtailed, ranging from health and welfare to finance and travel.\"  Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.) has a list of other possible effects of a shutdown. Funds to help states pay unemployment benefits could get disrupted, IRS tax-refund processing for certain returns would be suspended, new home-loan guarantees could cease, farm loans and payments would stop, and Small Business Administration approval of business loan guarantees and direct loans would likely cease.  Would the city of Washington D.C. be affected?  DC's garbage collection stops during a shutdown. (The Washington Post)  Yes. The District of Columbia is the only city barred from spending local funds during a shutdown, save for a few select services: The city will be able to keep police, firefighters and EMS units on duty. Public schools will also remain open.  But a variety of other city agencies would, in theory, have to close, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Public Works and the D.C. Public Libraries. Trash collection and street sweeping would come to a stop during the impasse. These activities all ceased for eight days during the 1995 shutdown, although Congress explicitly gave the city a reprieve during the 1996 impasse.  How many federal employees would be affected by a government shutdown?  Half of you go home. (Jeffrey MacMillan/For The Washington Post)  Roughly half. Back in 2011, the government estimated that 1.2 million federal employees (out of 2 million or so) would likely get furloughed and sent home without pay in the event of a shutdown.  Note that this is actually a higher number than in 1995-1996 shutdowns, when only 800,000 (out of 2 million or so) were sent home. That's because the earlier shutdown was actually less widespread: At the time, Congress had already funded a few select parts of government, including the Department of Defense and the FDA. That hasn't happened this time around, at least not yet. So more employees will be affected.  Do \"non-essential employees\" who get sent home ever get paid?  That's unclear, as my colleague Lisa Rein reports. On the first day of the shutdown, these employees do have to come to their offices to secure various files and make preparations necessary to halt their programs. The last time this happened, Congress later agreed to pay these employees retroactively when the government reopened. But that's completely up to Congress.  Is the government even prepared for a shutdown?  This is honestly the best stock art we've got to indicate the possibility of confusion and chaos. (Bigstock)  Maybe? As mentioned before, the Office of Management and Budget has asked federal agencies to develop contingency plans for a shutdown. But chaos is certainly possible. Back during the 1995 shutdown, the Social Security Administration initially sent home far too many workers and had to recall 50,000 of them after three days in order to carry out its legal duties.  Which parts of the economy would be most affected by a shutdown?  In a research note earlier this week, Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Partners passed along some thoughts about the possible economic impacts of a shutdown in a few areas:  Tourism: U.S. tourist industries and airlines reportedly sustained millions of dollars in losses during the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns, in part because foreign visas were going unprocessed and in part because so many parks were shutting down. The passport and visa holdup can also disrupt business trips, both here and abroad.  Federal contractors. Of the $18 billion in federal contracts in the D.C. area back in 1995-1996, about one-fifth, or $3.7 billion, were put on hold during the shutdown. Employees of contractors were reportedly furloughed without pay.  Energy. The federal government would have to take a break from working on drilling permits and processing applications for liquefied natural gas exports.  Pharma and biotech. This one's hard to game out. The Food and Drug Administration didn't have to shut down in 1995 and 1996 because it was already funded. This time around, however, the FDA won't be spared, and the review process for new drugs might get bogged down. The shutdown could also put a cramp on the grant process from the National Institutes of Health. \"If prolonged,\" Krueger writes, \"that could negatively impact life sciences/diagnostics companies.  Would a government shutdown stop Obamacare from happening?  Nope. As Sarah Kliff has explained, the key parts of Obamacare rely on mandatory spending that isn't affected by a shutdown. \"That includes the new online marketplaces, known as exchanges, where uninsured people will be able to shop for coverage. The Medicaid expansion is funded with mandatory funding, as are the billions in federal tax credits to help with purchasing coverage.\" The government would continue to set these up.  How do you end a government shutdown?  Congress needs to pass a bill (or bills) to fund the government, and the White House has to sign them. They can do this at any time. Or they can sit at home and keep the government closed. Nothing requires them to do anything. It depends what sort of political pressure they're facing.  How often has the government shut down before?  Since 1976, there have been 17 different government shutdowns. The longest came in 1995-1996 and lasted 21 days, as Bill Clinton wrangled with congressional Republicans over budget matters. But there were six shutdowns in the 1970s, all lasting longer than eight days, and there was even a one-day shutdown in 1982 when Congress couldn't agree on funding for Nicaraguan Contras.  Is a government shutdown the same thing as breaching the debt ceiling?  Nope! Different type of crisis. In a government shutdown, the federal government is not allowed to make any new spending commitments (save for all the exceptions noted above).  By contrast, if we hit the debt-ceiling then the Treasury Department won't be able to borrow money to pay for spending that Congress has already approved. In that case, either Congress will have to lift the debt ceiling or the federal government will have to default on some of its bills, possibly including payments to bondholders. That could trigger big disruptions in the financial markets — or a long-term rise in borrowing costs.  The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that we're on pace to breach the debt ceiling sometime between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5. So if a government shutdown isn't thrilling enough for you, good news: There's another fiscal crisis just around the corner.  * Clarification: During a federal government shutdown, members of Congress would still get paid in full, but staffers and other congressional employees would not without a specific appropriation. See p. 10 here.  --The Congressional Research Service walks through the legal aspects of a government shutdown in this report (pdf).  -- Here's Dylan Matthews explaining the ins and outs of the ongoing budget impasse in Congress.

        "article": "Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots absolutely own Jeff Fisher. In their past two meetings, the Patriots have outscored the Rams 104-7. They’ll meet once again on Sunday, when Fisher’s squad heads east to Foxborough for a road game against the best team in the AFC.  It doesn’t bode well for the Rams, who are limping to the finish line, but it’s even worse that Fisher doesn’t know the players his team is taking on. During a conference call Wednesday, Fisher was asked about the Patriots’ running back trio – LeGarrette Blount, James White and Dion Lewis. Here’s what he had to say.  “Well, they’re all different,” Fisher said, via NESN. “I have a place in my heart for LeGarrette, because I gave him a start, and I have great respect for him. He’s a big back, and he’s hard to get down. And as they rotate through, different guys play in different situations, and they do a good job with it. He knows where the ball’s going to go, and the guys are very, very disciplined.  This is when things get, well, interesting.  “I’ve been impressed with Brandon and what he’s done out of the backfield. You’ve got to deal with him, in addition to Danny. You’ve got playmakers all around, so we have to play sound defense.”  Brandon? Danny? Who exactly is he referring to here? That’s not exactly clear.  Perhaps he’s talking about Brandon Bolden, who hardly ever plays and is mostly a special teamer. And Danny might be Danny Woodhead, who hasn’t played for the Patriots since 2012.  New England media guys unsurprisingly had a field day with Fisher on Twitter afterwards, poking fun at the fact that he doesn’t know the guys he’ll be trying to game plan against in four days.  I love how Jeff Fisher just randomly started guessing at names that could be Patriots running backs. Uh, Brandon? Danny? Decent guesses.  In a Rams film session:Fisher: \"Man, how can we block Easley?\"Boras: \"Uh, Jeff...\"JF: \"So explosive.\"RB: \"He plays for us.\"JF:  Fisher better get in the film room and acquaint himself with the Patriots’ two dynamic backs.",

Wilson was standing at the counter across from employees at the GameStop store when two brothers, Carlton Hipps and Ramone Williams, walked in carrying guns, police said.  They allegedly stuck up the store with at least five patrons and two employees inside.  \"They said they thought it was going to be an easy target,\" said police spokesman Capt. James Clark. The store is in a quiet cul-de-sac.  Williams and Hipps had not seen the police car outside, where Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson sat. Nor did they notice Wilson, who was in uniform.  Wilson confronted them, and a firefight broke out, police said.  The officer, an eight-year veteran, stepped away from others in the store to keep them out of the crossfire, police said after watching the store's security camera footage.  He was a hero and a warrior, Clark said. \"He fought until the very, very end, firing at both of them.\"  Hipps and Williams ducked out of sight at times behind movie posters as they trained their fire on Wilson, Clark said.  Within 30 to 40 seconds, 50 shots fell, he said.  \"Officer Wilson was shot multiple times in the body and once in the head. That is the shot that ultimately killed him,\" the captain said.  With Wilson down, the two men ran out of the store, where Stevenson intercepted them. The officer wounded Hipps in the leg, and Williams ran back inside the store.  He stood around, trying to act like he was just another customer when they arrested him, police said. He later gave them a confession.  Both brothers have been charged with Wilson's murder and with attempted murder on Stevenson.  The brothers told police that it was their first robbery attempt, but it wasn't their first run-in with the law.  Williams, who is 26, has been arrested twice before, and Hipps, who is 30, six times, police said. He was released from jail in 2009, Clark said.  In the brothers' home, police found an AK-47.  The guns used in the robbery were bought on the street, police said. They want to find out who provided them.  At the GameStop, residents have started a memorial, and it's growing, CNN affiliate KYW reported. At the 22nd police district, where Wilson worked, the flag hangs at half-staff.  Actor Dan Aykryod, who was in town on a promotional tour, made a donation to Wilson's family and encouraged others to do the same.  Wilson was 30 years old. In addition to his son, he leaves behind a 1-year-old daughter.  His son turns 10 on Monday. The game was also going to be a birthday present.

Option traders were active on MSFT in multiple contracts and the call-to-put ratio of more than 2-to-1 points to investor preference for call options as compared to puts today. One trade of note was the sale of 18,000 calls for a premium of 53 cents apiece at the June 22 strike price. Perhaps this sale represents an effective covered call by an investor who is long the stock and looking to pocket the premium and bank gains on the recent rallies by exiting the long position should shares rise above $22.00 by expiration in June.  A similar strategy was confirmed at the October 24 strike price as one investor initiated a buy-write or covered call strategy by picking up shares of the underlying stock and simultaneously selling 3,000 calls for 88 cents each. The short call position provides an exit strategy for the investor who will have taken in the premium and banked 15% gains on the stock should it rise through $24.00 by expiration in October. Further along in the January 2010 and 2011 contracts, one investor appears to have placed a calendar spread using the 20 strikes by selling 7,500 puts for 2.73 in the January 2010 contract against the purchase of 7,500 puts at the January 2011 contract for 4.36 apiece. There is significant established open interest at both strikes already, and today's sold calendar spread could mark the closing half of a trade established while MSFT was lower in price.  Silicon Laboratories ( SLAB - news - people ):The provider of mixed-signal integrated circuits has surged by more than 10% to stand at $32.04 per share after the company reported sales and earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. The Austin, Texas-based SLAB announced earnings of 22 cents per share, which trumped the average consensus of approximately 13 cents. Investors got bullish on the stock by picking up more than 1,600 calls at the June 35 strike price for an average premium of 67 cents apiece. Shares would need to rally by an additional 11% to the breakeven point at $35.67 in order for bullish traders to profit by expiration in June. SLAB appeared on our 'top option implied volatility % losers' market scanner as volatility on the stock dissipated from 50% yesterday to 36% following the firm's positive earnings results.  QLogic Corporation ( QLGC - news - people ):The designer and developer of storage network infrastructure components has experienced a share price rally of more than 9% to $14.61 ahead of earnings expected for release tomorrow afternoon. One news source reported rumors of a potential takeover of the company by EMC Corporation ( EMC - news - people ), which may have contributed to the surge in option- implied volatility on the stock, which is up to 61% from the reading of 53% Tuesday. Option traders jumped into bullish calls in the May contract by purchasing more than 6,300 contracts at the 15.0 strike for an average premium of 37 cents apiece. In order to profit from the call options by expiration, shares need only increase by another 5% from the current price to the breakeven point at $15.37.  Boyd Gaming ( BYD - news - people ):Shares of the gaming company, which owns some 15 casinos, attracted bullish investors who were eager to play with options on the stock. BYD appeared on our \"hot by options volume\" market scanner amid a more than 8% share price rally to $8.70. Individuals looking to get bullish heavily favored the May 10 strike price where more than 11,900 calls traded hands with approximately 7,500 of the contracts purchased for an average premium of 50 cents apiece. The call-to-put ratio currently stands at more than 18-to-1, indicating that 18 call options were traded for every single put in action. Shares would need to continue to climb by about 15% from the current price in order for the May 10 calls to land in-the-money by expiration.  Intel ( INTC - news - people ):The semiconductor chip maker has experienced a share price rally of more than 1.5% to $15.32. We observed one options investor who is hoping to see shares continue to climb through expiration in June as he employed the covered call strategy. It appears that this individual bought shares of Intel and simultaneously sold 15,000 calls at the June 17 strike price for a premium of 24 cents per contract. This transaction provides an exit point if shares rise through $17.00 by expiration and yields the trader gains of about 11% on the stock in addition to the 24 cent premium enjoyed today.

        "article": "Ladies and gentlemen, a new record has been set: Copper Beech Farm is now the most-expensive home sale in the United States–ever. The estate, at 499 Indian Field Road in Greenwich, Connecticut, closed Friday for $120 million.  That figure shatters the prior record held by Softbank Softbank billionaire Masayoshi Son, who paid $117.5 million for his Woodside estate in November 2012. It also beats the highest home sale of 2014 to date, the $102 million purchase of the Fleur de Lys Estate in Los Angeles’s Holmby Hills by someone whose legal firm shares an address with Michael Milken.  David Ogilvy & Associates, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate, had the listing, and Christie’s confirmed the sale to FORBES. The buyer was not disclosed, but purchased through an LLC.  The 50-acre estate originally listed for $190 million in May, then dropped the price by $50 million in September to $140 million. Subsequently, the listing dropped another $10 million before closing for $120 million last week. That’s a very speedy sale–less than a year–for a house at such a high price point.  “It was 11 months from start to finish,” Ogilvy told FORBES. “But if you find the right buyer, there is nothing else that would fill the bill. There’s just no other 50-acre waterfront piece–nothing within 45 minutes of New York.”  Named for the copper beech trees populating the property, Copper Beech Farm was built in 1896. Harriet Lauder Greenway (whose father, George Lauder, helped Andrew Carnegie create U.S. Steel) purchased the property in 1904 and lived there for more than 75 years. The seller, timber tycoon John Rudey, bought the home three decades ago in an off-market deal. Until last year’s listing, the estate had not been publicly available for purchase for more than a century. The property is the largest waterfront estate on the coastline between Greenwich and New York City.  The estate includes a 13,519-square-foot main house with 12 bedrooms, seven full baths and two half baths and a wood-paneled library. Additional selling points: a solarium, a wine cellar, and a three-story-high, wood-paneled foyer. Most of the house’s rooms include fireplaces and sleeping porches, which were used as more breezy bedrooms during the oppressively hot summer months prior to air conditioning.  “The buyer plans to keep the home intact,” Ogilvy said, rather than tear it down or do a gut renovation. The front door is 40 feet above main high water, he noted, and although that provides incredible views across Long Island Sound it also helps allay concerns about potentially disastrous natural events.  The local paper, the Greenwich Time, was the first to report the sale.  FORBES toured Copper Beech Farm in October. Enjoy the video, below:",

        "article": "Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times  Representative Gabrielle Giffords with her husband, Mark Kelly, led the Pledge of Allegiance at a candlelight vigil to honor victims in Tucson on Sunday.  TUCSON — The sun had fallen and a crowd had gathered on a chilly Sunday night on the mall at the University of Arizona, for the last event of a weekend commemorating the first anniversary of the mass shooting here one year ago. The vigil began with the Pledge of the Allegiance.  Led by Representative Gabrielle Giffords.  The crowd responded with gasps and a roar as Ms. Giffords, wearing a vibrant red scarf, walked unaided slowly to the center of the stage. Most had expected her to be there — that is why many had come — but few thought she would be able to play such a central role.  “I pledge of allegiance,” Ms. Giffords began, speaking slowly — almost defiantly — as the crowd of several thousand, some in tears, joined in. Ms. Giffords holding her stiff right arm with her left hand, finished with a bright grin at the crowd. She was led slowly and unsteadily to the side of the stage by Ron Barber, her chief of staff who was also shot in the attack and led the ceremony tonight.  “It gives you goose bumps,” said Michael Wood, 52, a construction worker in the crowd, his gaze fixed on the congresswoman, who was shot in the head just one year ago. “It’s good to see her. She looked really good.”  It was a stirring ending to a two-day commemoration that was in many ways remarkable for how understated it was.  A year ago, after the shooting attack that left 6 people dead and 13 wounded — including Ms. Giffords — this city gathered in an expression of grief and shock that lasted for weeks. There was a blur of funerals, a crush of flowers, candles and well-wishers on the expanse of lawn at the hospital where victims were taken, and a visit by President Obama that drew thousands.  On this anniversary, there was the candlelight vigil, an interdenominational prayer service, a ringing of bells at 10:11 a.m., marking the moment of the attack, and the reading of the names of victims.  There was Ms. Giffords herself, a quiet presence until her appearance Sunday, visiting places that have become national symbols of the attack (even if they have little meaning to her, given her inability to remember the events of that day): the Safeway supermarket where the shootings took place and the intensive care unit at the University of Arizona Medical Center where people were taken.  But there were also anniversary events more in keeping with the character of this community, where people have struggled to comprehend how such brutal violence could unfold in such a serene place. There were yoga, meditation, designated hugging spots, dancing and steel drum playing. There were campaigns promoting civility and community — people gathered Saturday at a park to sign a “Tucsonans Commit to Kindness” contract. At the vigil, the crowd held a lot blue glow stick — taking care not to light them until Mr. Barber told them it was time — that cast a slightly mystical air to the whole event.  “You have to understand: This has always been a very civil community, a community that has always been tied together,” said the mayor, Jonathan Rothschild. “We are a different place. We are a city of one million people, and sometimes we acted, to our benefit and detraction, as a community of 50,000 people. For something like this to happen was such a shock.”  “Tucson is a changed community,” he said.  For Tucson, this is a turning point as it searches for a way to mark the tragedy — to give it meaning beyond the day itself — without the images from the Safeway parking lot becoming the first thing people think of at the mention of the city. “We refuse to let this tragic day define us,” Patricia Maisch, one of the women who wrested the gun from the shooter, said at a service memorializing the victims at a hall at the University of Arizona.  Sunday’s events included two church services, a memorial service and a candlelight vigil. Hundreds gathered for an interfaith service at the St. Augustine Cathedral, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson; a shofar was sounded by a rabbi, a prayer was read from the Koran, and there was a welcome from a Lutheran pastor and the vicar general of the Diocese of Tucson. Nearly every pew of the soaring church — still decorated with Christmas wreaths — was filled. People sat quietly, some holding back tears, as a bell was rung as the name of each of the six people who died was called out in the church.

        "article": "It was not an auspicious start to the new year for bitcoin investors.  Over the first weekend of 2015 the second-largest bitcoin exchange, Slovenia-based Bitstamp, was victim of a hack to the tune of some $5 million U.S. dollars’ worth of the digital currency. As the tech press were quick to point out, it was a worrisome start to the year for a digital currency that Quartz had already declared “the worst investment of 2014.” And if you look at its performance between Jan 1, 2014 and Jan. 1, 2015, that’s not wrong: bitcoin ended the year at 39% of the value it started with.  In reality, bitcoin displayed major momentum in the last year as both a technology and a movement, and looks poised to convert more skeptics in the year to come. The metrics in a range of areas prove it: the number of bitcoin-related startups and jobs has boomed; the number of accepting institutions has bloomed; and activity among developers is greater than ever.  For starters, breaches like that of Bitstamp and the much larger (valued at about $400 million at the time) 2011 hack of the exchange Mt. Gox are often misconstrued as security issues with the currency itself. But they are only signs of flaws in those particular exchanges and not a sign of an issue with the underlying technology. And it is the underlying technology behind bitcoin that most excites. As we wrote in the “Shape the Future” package of our January 2015 issue, most of the vocal enthusiasts so bullish on bitcoin—from big-name entrepreneurs like Marc Andreessen to the developers and miners who spend their days refreshing the bitcoin Reddit page—are more interested in the applications that can be built on bitcoin’s “block chain,” the currency’s foundational backbone, than they are in bitcoin as a monetary system. The block chain allows the secure exchange of any form of value between two entities.  One of the most discussed potential use cases of the block chain is as a decentralized Uber. Instead of using an app, customers could order a car and pay the driver directly, cutting out the middleman. (Sorry, Travis Kalanick.) The block chain can be utilized for everything from the storage of secure documents (that is, a decentralized Dropbox, too) to “watermarking,” in which a specific coin could contain, say, the deed to your house. “The block chain is going to spawn decades of innovation,” says Ryan Selkis, director of investments at the Digital Currency Group, created by former SecondMarket founder Barry Silbert. “It could lead to things like frictionless share issuance, title transfers, smart contracts. Collectively these things make up the backbone of the economy. If you wanted to create a decentralized Uber, Dropbox, Facebook, you could reinvent the Internet.”  The block chain has such rich potential that there is an initiative underway to create additional “side chains,” though there is controversy around that idea. “We don’t really want to mess with the main block chain right now,” says Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a block chain API that makes it easier to create bitcoin applications. “It works, we don’t want to break it.”  For now, most of the activity around bitcoin is monetary in nature, so it makes sense that its critics point to volatility. Though the value of one bitcoin in U.S. dollars has fallen 67% in the past year, its value over the past two years is up 95%, according to the market price chart at blockchain.info. So whether it’s a good investment or a bad one is a matter of perspective.  In the meantime, the sheer total of bitcoin-related startups that launched in 2014 demonstrates bitcoin’s momentum. There is no definitive listing of every single bitcoin startup, but 2014 almost certainly saw the launch of more of them than in any year prior. Data that AngelList sent to Fortune confirms that. In 2011, five bitcoin startups listed themselves on AngelList. In 2012 that number grew to 13. In 2013 it jumped to 193, and last year it exploded to 566. (But not all startups register on AngelList immediately, if at all.) In addition, on January 8 the total number of daily bitcoin transactions hit an all-time high, as Barry Silbert eagerly tweeted.  Developer activity is also at a fever pitch. According to the contributor graph at GitHub, the total number of contributions to bitcoin’s master code in November was the highest it had been since spring 2012. Bitcoin is also the 31st “most forked repository” on GitHub—”forks” are basically proposed or in-progress alterations to core code—out of more than 900,000. In other words, for developers, bitcoin is trending. The number of open jobs currently posted at bitcoin companies also underscores developer interest: it’s at 105, which is close to the all-time high in September of 137, according to Bitcoin Pulse, which monitors such trends.  Academics appear to be more interested in the cryptocurrency than ever before. There were 190 white papers published on bitcoin in 2014, up from 55 in 2013. Authors—amateur or otherwise—have also flocked to bitcoin: Amazon lists 437 books about or involving the term “bitcoin” published in 2014, compared to 143 in 2013. (That is based on a subject search, and thus includes less hard-hitting titles like Bitcoin Bimbo 3: Undercover Cop Science Fiction Erotica.) And sports fans this year may not have been able to ignore the inaugural Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl, a college football playoff game between North Carolina State and the University of Central Florida. ESPN quickly converted BitPay’s $500,000 rights fee for the game into U.S. dollars.  Another indicator of bitcoin’s momentum is the number of mainstream businesses that accept it. In 2014, Microsoft MSFT , PayPal, Dell, and Dish Network DISH , among many others, announced they would accept bitcoin as payment for a range of products. Those companies joined companies such as Target TGT , Overstock.com, and WordPress. Even the publisher of Fortune, Time Inc. TIME , began accepting the cryptocurrency for magazine subscriptions. Yahoo YHOO also added bitcoin to its Yahoo Finance tracking site last year, lending the currency additional legitimacy, and Google Finance GOOG quickly followed suit. “Adoption of bitcoin is becoming more commonplace, and we feel it is relevant to our industry and to our users,” Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer told CoinDesk. Don’t be at all surprised if Yahoo soon goes even bigger on bitcoin—whether by acquiring a bitcoin startup or some other announcement—as part of Mayer’s ongoing effort to make the stalling search giant more hip.  Rafael Corrales, a partner at Charles River Ventures, believes that the growth in a wide range of fields—from academia to infrastructure to policy—is a sign that 2014 was the biggest year bitcoin has had yet, despite its volatility. “In the short-term, that’s an easy knock from people who don’t understand or believe it can be something,” he says. “It’s the easiest thing for them to go after. In that transition stage, you’re going to have extreme volatility, so looking at its value over one year is kind of silly.” As for occasional hacks, he adds, “There are going to be bumps in the short term, but they’ll be solved sooner than later. And these things are being addressed by a huge community of people. So you have to be really excited, despite small bumps.”  To be sure, that excitement can certainly lead to unrealistic declarations from those in the community. Some bitcoin developers and investors proclaim that within five years, all the major banks will be accepting bitcoin. That’s a stretch, acknowledges Peter Smith, COO of the bitcoin wallet Blockchain (not to be confused with the actual bitcoin block chain). “I hear a lot of predictions about how soon the whole world will be using bitcoin, and most of the time, those are unrealistic,” he says. “What we’re trying to do as an ecosystem is incredibly audacious, so it’s going to take a lot of time.”  How much time? And to what extent will bitcoin, in seeking wide adoption as a currency and as a protocol for new applications, face the hurdle of mainstream consumers’ lack of understanding? Adam Ludwin suggests that people don’t need to understand how the technology works to appreciate it. “It has the quality of early Internet,” he says. “People don’t actually know anything about how it works, but they don’t need to know, or care. They just know they turn their computer on and can check email.”  As for bitcoin in the mainstream banking system? “We are still a good year away, in our estimation, from where you can imagine a known financial services company using this,” Ludwin says. “But it’s not 10 years. And when it happens, people will be surprised by how quickly it spreads.”",

American International Group Inc. has agreed to sell some of its Latin American and European property-and-casualty insurance operations to Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., as the global insurer continues a campaign to narrow its focus and boost financial results.  The deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the companies Tuesday morning, marks the latest international acquisition by the Toronto-based holding company founded in 1985 by businessman Prem Watsa, one of Canada’s most prominent investors.  Under the pact, AIG will sell commercial- and consumer-insurance operations in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela and Turkey. Fairfax also will assume AIG’s operating assets in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.  Total cash consideration is about $240 million. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals.  AIG has been under pressure since last fall to improve its performance, when activist investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson called on the company to break itself into parts. AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock resisted such a split as not in shareholders’ best interests, and has pledged a variety of alternative measures instead, including selected divestitures, cost-cutting and aggressive share buybacks.  A leading seller of insurance to multinational corporations, AIG will continue serving clients with operations in the countries that are part of the Fairfax pact through a partnership with the Canadian company. AIG, long one of the U.S.’s most global companies, will focus on investments in countries where it sees good opportunities for scale and strong growth.  Fairfax has a variety of holdings in the insurance, travel and restaurant sectors, among other investments. Mr. Watsa has been compared often with U.S. investor Warren Buffett, chairman of wide-ranging conglomerate and insurance giant Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Fairfax, with reported total assets of $27.8 billion in 2015, has been building its property-and-casualty operations by buying assets from global insurers that are retreating from smaller markets.  In July, it agreed to acquire the South African and Botswana insurance operations from Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd., and in 2015 it acquired the Ukrainian division of QBE Management (Ireland) Ltd.  The pact with AIG will provide Fairfax with well-established businesses with experienced management teams. The deal will significantly expand Fairfax’s footprint in Latin America.  At AIG, Mr. Paulson and a lieutenant to Mr. Icahn now sit on AIG’s board. Among other streamlining moves this year, AIG in August agreed to sell its mortgage-insurance unit for about $3.4 billion to Arch Capital Group Ltd.

        "article": "Saturn's geyser-spewing moon, Enceladus, may hide an interior ocean only 25 miles under its icy crust, planetary scientists report.  Enceladus, a 318-mile-wide moon, startled astronomers in 2005, when the international Cassini spacecraft confirmed that watery geysers burst from the mini-world's south pole. Fly-overs have since detected higher temperatures emanating from the rifts than the surrounding ice crust covering the moon.  In the current Geophysical Research Letters, a team led by John Olin of the University of Texas at El Paso, reports that the four \"tiger stripe\" rifts lining the moon's southern pole region -- the source of the geysers -- give away the thickness of the moon's ice crust. \"Here we pose the question: What is the upper bound on the thickness of Enceladus's ice shell,\" write the study authors.  We assume a global subsurface liquid ocean for our Enceladus model, consistent with geophysical and geochemical evidence. (A 2009 Nature report team did) propose a global subsurface ocean based on the presence of (argon) and ammonia in Enceladus's plume, suggesting that an ocean layer provides an efficient means for these to reach the surface of a differentiated interior. Sodium detected in Saturn's E‐ring and analysis of the curvilinear fractures near the tiger stripes and apparent rotation about the southern pole also hint at a global ocean. Furthermore, shear motion along Enceladus's tiger stripes requires sufficient generation of tidal stresses from models based on a global ocean. Other studies have suggested a localized south polar sea beneath the tiger stripes, though it remains to be demonstrated whether these findings would result in sufficient stress to induce tectonic motion.  Based on indications of the shallow depths of the rifts, less than 2 miles deep, the study authors calculate that the ice crust must be less than 25 miles thick, or else the tidal and interior heat stresses on the moon would not be strong enough to create such side-slipping fractures as the tiger stripes. The exact source of heating inside the moon, thought too small to have much of an interior core, remains a hot topic of debate.  Past studies of geyser plume chemistry suggested the ice shell can't be more than about 30 miles thick, the study authors add, saying, \"plausibly the ice shell has evolved in thickness.\" Melting from below may have thinned a once-thicker ice shell. With geysers, \"initiating in a thick ice shell, and tiger stripe activity commencing as the ice shell thinned, a plausible scenario is one in which the convective and tectonic style of Enceladus has changed through time,\" they conclude.

The White House provided background on Petry:  Leroy Arthur Petry was born on July 29, 1979. He is a native of Sante Fe, New Mexico and enlisted in the United States Army in September 1999. He attended Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Benning, Ga.  Sergeant First Class Petry is currently assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment and attached to Special Operations Command (SOCOM) with duty at Joint Base Lewis McChord as a liaison for the SOCOM Care Coalition where he tracks and monitors injured Rangers returning from the Theater of Operations to the initial place of care to home station care.  Sergeant First Class Petry has completed multiple combat tours to Afghanistan and Iraq totaling 28 months of deployment.

But for something that usually isn’t much fun, Americans do it a lot. The average person visited a doctor’s office three times in 2000, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.  If that sounds high, consider a growing over-65 population, an increasingly health-conscious population and the usual battery of checkups and examinations, and it’s easier to understand how Americans racked up 823.5 million office visits in those 12 months. Bear in mind that this number does not include any kind of emergency or urgent care. The total number of visits has increased with the population, but the per-person visit rate is also up, from 2.7 in 1980. So why are we going to the doctor so much?  Often, we’re going because we want to, or at least we know we should. In 2000, 18% of doctor’s appointments were for diagnostic tests, health screenings and preventive services, up from about 16% in 1990. Physicians, however, say they’ve noted a greater increase in the interest and awareness patients have in these services than the numbers indicate.  “There’s more sophistication on the part of the public on preventive care and health screening,” says Dr. John Saultz, chairman of the Department of Family Medicine and associate dean for primary care at Oregon Health and Science University. People better understand now the benefits of knowing their cholesterol level, taking a PSA test to detect prostate disease or having regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, among other health matters.  Dr. Nicole Nisly, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Iowa, says she has seen the health awareness and knowledge of her patients grow tremendously in her 20 years in medicine. “I see the baby boomer population becoming more aware of their own morbidity,” Nisly says. As a result, this well-read, well-educated population is getting proactive about health. She says she sometimes has patients come in requesting a new test or a new drug before she’s even heard of them.  This population is also seeking out more specialists and alternative health providers for their care. Primary care physicians took 66% of all office appointments in 1980, but now see only 59%.  On the opposite side of her hyper-informed, health-conscious patients are those who aren’t paying enough attention to their well-being, Nisly says. “There’s been just an incredible increase in diseases related to obesity,” she says. The nation’s skyrocketing rates of overweight and obese youth and adults have registered in doctors’ offices with increasing cases of high blood pressure, sleep apnea, joint pain and diabetes. In fact, the increase in Type II diabetes, which is often caused by lifestyle, has been dramatic enough to move the condition from the tenth most common diagnosis in the 1980 Center for Health Statistics data to the third most common in 2000. It beat out both ear infections and pregnancy.  Both populations are, in their own ways, driving up the cost of health care. For the health-conscious baby boomer and the growing aging population, more doctor visits, more sophisticated tests and more specialists add up to more money. Problems like obesity and people living longer with chronic diseases strain the system in other ways. The cost of drugs is also a huge factor in the increasing cost of care, according to a study done by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The increased use and expense of prescription drugs have pushed drug costs up 11% between 2000 and 2001 alone.  The National Center for Health Statistics reports that at least one drug was prescribed at 66% of all office visits, and the list of the most prescribed drugs has shifted in just 10 years from mostly generic antibiotics and pain medications to brand-name medications like Pfizer ‘s Celebrex and Lipitor.  Higher health costs mean many employers are facing the fourth straight year of rising health insurance premiums. Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm, found employers may be facing double-digit increases next year, and they’re passing on some of those increases to their employees in the form of higher premiums and co-payments.  But what are the most common aches, pains, itches and illnesses that drive us to visit our doctor? The following was compiled based on the symptoms patients recorded as the primary reason for visiting their doctor’s office in 2000. It was compiled with data from the National Center on Health Statistics and excludes visits for postoperative and general medical examinations.

        "article": "Heads turned in bars and restaurants in the West Village on Saturday night. On the High Line, people held camera phones. Taxi drivers honked and rolled down their windows to whistle. Workers closing the Magnolia Bakery on Bleecker Street for the night opened the door to cheer. In the narrow doorway of a silversmith’s shop in Greenwich Village, a woman started gyrating.  “What’s going on?” passers-by asked one another. “A flash mob?”  “Where’s the music?” a woman asked.  “This tryouts for ‘Glee’?” one man wondered aloud.  “It’s a global floating dance party,” called out one of the 90 or so shimmying, bopping and skipping dancers, who were winding their way from Chelsea Piers to the High Line and through Greenwich Village. Explanation offered, the man plugged his iPhone earbuds back in and sprinted to catch up with the crowd.  Brought together by Facebook and word of mouth, the mass of dancers were all silently moving to the beat of the same D.J. track, which they had downloaded before meeting at a park north of Chelsea Piers. Throwing their arms up and swaying at the hips, they swung themselves around poles, clambered onto outdoor furniture, and rippled down the streets of Chelsea and Greenwich Village. Much the same thing had happened in a dozen cities around the world starting the night before, with each dance party picking up at 10 p.m. where the previous one had left off.  “This is so ridiculous, but so awesome!” one young woman yelled to a friend as the group left the grassy bowl where they had started and sprinted for some patio furniture. Some jumped on the tables; others jumped onto each other’s shoulders. A few stragglers were content to dance a few yards behind the rest of the group, closing their eyes and twirling in place.  “More energy, c’mon!” a young man shouted. “More vigorous move choices!”  “Are you on the right beat?” one dancer yelled to another.  The event was the brainchild of Tully McLoughlin, a Yale graduate living in Ghana. Mr. McLoughlin and his dance-party partner, Alf Molinas, a friend from college living in Tokyo, say they envisioned the event as an experiment in social media and mobile technology: Getting hundreds of people around the world to use Twitter, Facebook and cellphones to create a global flash mob.  But all of that was lost on many of the passers-by who stopped to watch the dance party.  At the High Line, a couple stopped several yards short of the stairway to watch the group run up the stairs. The couple linked arms as they paused, the man smoking, the woman smiling.  “Let’s join in!” said one young woman on the High Line before pulling her friend into the mass of dancers stomping on a long bench.  When the party reached Abingdon Square Park, one man left his friends to run over and ask what was going on.  “That is so sick! Can I listen?” he said, plugging one iPod earbud into his right ear. “Hey, I can dance with you guys!”  At the intersection of West Fourth and Cornelia Streets, where the mash-up switched songs to Duck Sauce’s “Barbra Streisand,” three women listened with interest to a dancer’s explanation of what was going on.  “High five,” one of them said, high-fiving the dancer. “If only I had a download. Keep dancing!”  “It’s just a flash mob,” one said, dismissively.  “They look like fools,” another said.  For the most part, the several New York City police officers the party ran by merely shrugged at the dancers’ antics. Two officers by the Hudson River were too absorbed in their cruiser, which had broken down by the West Side Highway, to notice. A couple of security officers did intervene, attempting to shoo the group away from the Hudson River Greenway, where the group had picked up another 20 dancers.  “You have to have a permit if it’s a group of 20 or more,” one of the officers announced, “especially if I can hear you all the way down there from here.”  “This is a global floating dance party,” Alex Kramer, one of the group’s local organizers, said earnestly. “It’s going on all over the world.”  “You need a permit to do anything,” the officer repeated.  In the nighttime heat, most of the dancers’ shirts showed large sweat stains by the time they reached Union Square, the group’s last stop. The light rain that began to fall drew a cheer. The group hurried into the subway station, paused for a few minutes of dancing, then hurried out again. Under the gaze of the equestrian statue facing a Whole Foods market, the dancers huddled, raised their hands in the air, gave a cheer and — walking now — headed for the nearest cold drink.",

Former SF Giants All-Star Stu Miller dies at 87  Stu Miller was a superb major-league pitcher for 16 seasons and was best known for something he swore did not happen on a windy 1961 afternoon at Candlestick Park.  In the process, the reputation of San Francisco’s ballpark was cemented.  Mr. Miller, the pitcher supposedly “blown off the mound” at Candlestick by a gust of wind during one of the two All-Star Games played that year, died Sunday after a brief illness at his home in Cameron Park (El Dorado County). He was 87.  He pitched for five major-league teams between 1952 and ’68 and was an original San Francisco Giant.  He saved 154 games for the Cardinals, New York and San Francisco Giants, and the Orioles in an era when closers worked multiple innings. He led the National League with 17 saves in 1961 and the American League with 27 in 1963, and appeared in 51 games for the pitching-rich 1966 Orioles team that swept the Dodgers in the World Series.  Mr. Miller was best known for a wind-caused balk in his only All-Star appearance, a year after Candlestick opened on the eponymous spit of land that juts into San Francisco Bay in the southeastern corner of the city.  In a 2007 interview, Mr. Miller recounted the balk, which occurred as he faced Detroit’s Rocky Colavito in the ninth inning of a game the National League would win 5-4 in the 10th.  “A gust of wind gave my body a little bit of sway,” Mr. Miller said. “The next day in the paper, the banner headline was, 'Miller blown off mound.’ You’d think I was pinned against the center-field fence.”  The legend of Mr. Miller being blown off the mound remains fact for many and overshadowed a career of 704 games, all but 93 in relief. Twice he was named the Sporting News’ Fireman of the Year.  “It’s nice to be known,” Mr. Miller said, “but it’s not nice to be known as the guy who got blown off the mound.”  Mr. Miller’s best pitch was a changeup.  As longtime adversary Maury Wills of the Dodgers recounted in 2007, “He was a fabulous pitcher. Miller could throw a changeup off a changeup. You knew it was coming and you still couldn’t hit it.”  Giants teammate Mike McCormick remembered Mr. Miller on Monday as a “good teammate, a good friend” and a crossword-puzzle fanatic. McCormick also remembered the changeup — or, more accurately, Mr. Miller’s variety of changeups.  “He was most unusual,” McCormick said. “He had the ability to change speeds probably better than anybody in his time. We always had the funny stories about Frank Howard and the other big sluggers who couldn’t hit him with a tennis racket.”  Mr. Miller is survived by his wife, Jayne; daughters Lori and Kim; sons Scott, Marc, Gary and Matthew; and five grandchildren.  In a statement, Giants President Larry Baer said Mr. Miller’s passing brought “great sadness to our organization. Stu had a long and distinguished career with some of his best seasons coming in a Giants uniform. We express our deepest condolences to his family and will have them in our thoughts and prayers.”  Henry Schulman is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

        "article": "Here’s a secret: A few years ago, on a buzzing Saturday night in Cambridge, I was in the DJ booth at River Gods, the beloved Central Square restaurant and nightspot. Three songs into my set, I reached for my drink, knocked it over, and the cocktail glass shattered on a metal electrical box.  The entire contents of that Manhattan, down to the cherry, soaked the switches and triggered a piercing fire alarm. No one knew how to defuse it. Within minutes, everyone spilled out onto the street, cupping their ears and glaring at the DJ who’d just ruined their night and possibly their hearing.  It was my fault, but I was too mortified to tell the truth when asked what happened. Caroline Enright, the general manager, rushed from home to turn off the alarm. She called the fire department to say no firetrucks were needed. And then, looking right at me as she scooped up the wet shards of glass, she said to the dispatcher, “I’m not sure what happened, really, but we have been having some power outages lately.” She covered for me.  I’m confessing this now because it neatly sums up what made River Gods a second home to the hundreds, perhaps thousands, who revered it as their favorite bar around town. Actually, it wasn’t a bar; it was a community.  On Monday, owner Jackie Linnane stunned the faithful with an announcement on Facebook: After nearly 15 years, River Gods had suddenly closed over the weekend — for good. She wasn’t able to renew her lease.  Owner Jackie Linnane announced Monday that the bar was “unsuccessful in renewing” its lease and is now permanently shuttered.  “Far too raw,” Linnane wrote me in an e-mail, explaining her decision not to comment any further. “The staff and I are too upset, and it’s surreal.”  They’re not alone in their shock and sadness. In the 24 hours since news broke, River Gods’ admirers have mourned its closure as yet another tear in the city’s cultural fabric.  It was the kind of place that even if you never stepped inside, it made an impression as you drove past it on River Street. It was mysterious, with the nondescript exterior of a dive bar, but it was more — so much more — than that.  Linnane, who’s from Ireland, transformed the space into a hybrid of a gastropub, a gothic sanctuary, and a friendly neighborhood watering hole plucked from a David Lynch movie. Cambridge’s answer to “Cheers,” minus the sitcom antics and with sexier lighting.  It was so larger than life, in fact, that you often forgot its cozy capacity. “A small, intimate bar with a giant, generous heart” is how Melissa Farrington, a longtime River Gods DJ, described it in a heartsick Facebook post.  Part of its magic was that River Gods took chances with amateur DJs, many of whom got their first taste of spinning music for the masses there and ended up making it a regular hobby — this writer included. There wasn’t room for dancing, but there was plenty of opportunity to discover and connect with all sorts of music, from early rock ’n’ roll and old-school soul to fizzy synth-pop and tribute nights to David Bowie and Prince.  “The willingness to invite people into their space and curate a night of music and visuals that you’re not going to hear or see anywhere else in town is something you don’t come by very often,” Evan Hiltunen, the bar’s last entertainment promoter, wrote on Facebook. “Jackie and Caroline have been the force behind the scenes to keep this community going for a long time.”  A DJ could take chances, really have some fun, and trust that the crowd would go along with you. Say, for example, you were feeling cheeky and played Salt-N-Pepa’s “Shoop,” followed by Cher’s version of “The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss).” No one minded!  And it’s safe to say it was the only local bar — scratch that: the only bar in the world — where last call would sometimes coincide with Barbra Streisand caterwauling her way through Bowie’s “Life on Mars?” (Pro tip: To get people to leave, that’s even more effective than turning up the house lights.)  I saved the note that Emily, a complete stranger, told the bartender to give me after a particularly eclectic night. “To the DJ,” she scrawled on the back of a cocktail napkin. “I doubt I’m your type, at all. But Chet Baker is incredible to hear out and about.” She signed it with her e-mail address. (Alas, she was right: She wasn’t my type.)  The staff, who collectively called themselves River Gods and Goddesses, were characters in their own right. Head chef Luke Park whipped up dozens of pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and entrees every night, and still found time to say hello and, if you were lucky, tell a dirty joke. The young men minding the door looked more like poets than bouncers. The female servers were no frills, all sass and efficiency.  Maureen Linnane, the night manager and Jackie Linnane’s sister whom we all called “Mo,” would remember your drink order — and make it a mocktail if you needed a break from the booze. I still remember the next time I DJed at River Gods after my fire-alarm fiasco. Mo asked, “What would you like to drink, love?”  She didn’t miss a beat: “Great. I’ll put it in a sippy cup for you.”  Visionary Irish women ran River Gods, and their imprints made it a singular destination. Patrons could count on the decor changing with each holiday, often with a dark sense of humor. Around Halloween, you’d see blond Barbie dolls dangling from the ceiling, their bare bodies wrapped in black masking tape.  River Gods was an original, a home away from home (a phrase bandied about in numerous online testimonials) whose demise somehow feels personal.  “If you adore a place, go to it,” Chris Ewen, another fixture in the DJ booth, advised on Facebook. “Do you have a favorite bar, or club night, or shop, or restaurant, or special secret location? A place or thing that means the world to you? Support it, as much as you can.”",

The entire contents of that Manhattan, down to the cherry, soaked the switches and triggered a piercing fire alarm. No one knew how to defuse it.

        "article": "The days of paper textbooks seem destined to become as distant a memory as cursive handwriting. In 2014, big data is reshaping the way students receive curriculum and learn, and the tools of the new and digital classroom are changing the dynamics for educators.  \"Data is changing the way people think,\" says Eileen Murphy Buckley, founder and CEO of ThinkCERCA, a company in the data-driven education space. \"From critical accountability to teacher accountability to the way we arrange time, our learning spaces, technologies — data is disrupting everything.\"  The inclusion of the computer in K–12 classes is nothing new; they've been on desks since the days of Texas Instruments. In more recent times, however, pupils aren't turning to their screens to learn a little BASIC or play a round of Oregon Trail — they're increasingly experiencing data-driven teaching as a fully integrated part of a post-textbook, personalized academic process.  If you think about the impact of technology on our lives today, algorithms are analyzing our behavior — both on and offline — all the time. They shape what we do in the moment, and they often steer us toward what we do next.  At many online stores — Amazon, for example — the ideas, suggestions and products in front of you are frequently placed there based on data gleaned from your order history, browsing habits and numerous other factors.  Education has entered this ecosystem, too. In the data-driven classroom, the concept of digitally collecting and analyzing students' work — at the district level and above — is already deeply a part of how school systems track and report performance. It's a key part of the standardized-testing milieu that No Child Left Behind made commonplace.  On the level of the individual classroom, digital curricula and data is changing the way teachers — and, in turn, learning — work. Below are just a few examples of the intersection of data and education.  Scoring and grading: In simple ways, applications such as BubbleScore allow teachers to either deliver multiple-choice tests via mobile devices or scan and score paper exams via mobile-device cameras. Tools like these typically allow instructors to export results to grade books and track progress along defined parameters — helpful for reporting under Common Core and state standards, for example.  Personalized, adaptive learning: More than just streamlining assignments and the grading process, data-driven classrooms opened up the experience of what students learn, when they learn it and at what level. Companies such as Knewton create digital courses that use big-data-fueled predictive analytics to pinpoint what a student is mastering (or not mastering), and what modules of a lesson plan best suit them under those circumstances.  Problem management: When it comes to issues that can arise in the classroom — a student handing in writing that might not be his own, for example — data is also at teachers' disposal. One company, iParadigms, leverages big data to cross-reference written work with public databases and other online resources. Its apps verify that all material submitted is original to the student writer.  There's a key factor at the core of all this functionality: The teacher, and the role he still plays at the center of data's classroom transformation.  As classrooms become more and more connected to data and its far-reaching potential, the human mind that's managing the process remains very much central to students' experiences.  Even companies that are promoting digital integration in the classroom remain keenly focused on the individual at the head of the class.  For example, a core component of ThinkCERCA's software is that while it guides students through the process of writing an effective argument, it also puts that writing — and the associated analysis — back in the hands of human beings. It's the teacher who assesses each pupil's work, and their interaction with the student is the cornerstone upon which ThinkCERCA's algorithms rely.  \"I would say that we really give teachers small data,\" says Buckley. \"It's really about capturing all the small human processes and putting those in front of people. You can liken it to [a fitness- and food-logging app]. You put in what you eat, and over time it gives you back data that you can understand in a very meaningful way.\"  Seeking to quantify human behavior that surrounds the back and forth of writing and teaching, ThinkCERCA's analytics (over time) can provide schools and educators with a new understanding of whether they're posing the right questions about their classrooms and methods in the first place.  And that, if you ask one educator, is the preferred approach to the data-driven classroom.  \"Big data could be leveraged to upend the standardization model altogether and enable a creativity- and problem-solving based approach,\" says Justin Lyon, a former high-school math teacher and the founder of Critical. \"Big data could free students and educators up to do stuff that matters.\"  Are you an educator using data in the classroom?

Learn how Sudy and Jackalope Jobs obsess over job seekers by connecting with them on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.  New research shows the effects of a bad hire go beyond a minimal cost. While 41% of employers estimated the costs of a bad hire to be more than $25,000 (and 24% estimated more than $50,000), many of these employers also listed loss of productivity, lost time to recruit and train another worker, and the cost to recruit and train another worker as the main pitfalls of making a bad hire.  But let’s flip our perspective for a moment and consider this: What if you are that bad hire? More importantly, as you look for your next job, how can you improve the perception to your new employer that you are not that bad, high-risk new hire?  You might be hiding in a corner right now wondering what you did wrong — but don’t put all the blame on yourself. In fact, it’s partially the employer’s fault. Employers reported that much of the reason for making a bad hire included trying to fill the job too quickly, insufficient talent intelligence and failure to check references.  If you’ve been fired because you just weren’t the “right fit” for a company, keep your chin up. Learn from your mistakes and the ones made by the hiring manager, and make sure your next job is a great fit for both you and your employer.  The following are a few ways to avoid being a bad hire for a company.  This can be a tough task. Use your networking skills and try to find out what happened with the employee you are replacing. You may need to walk a fine line between not being too nosy, but proper research should benefit you and your employer. One quote I have seen successfully used is, “I am not looking for a job, I am looking for a win, let's work together and learn from the past to get to a successful future.” This type of dialogue can certainly change the tone of your conversation with an employer.  Just as the employer needs to sufficiently research you, you also need to conduct adequate research on the company. This needs to be done way before you accept the job. In fact, you should be doing this research prior to writing the cover letter. Before you accept any job offer, take the time to truly understand the mechanics of your employer. Do a little research online: Take a look at their website, social media accounts, and any recent news.  Consider these questions when doing company research:  What’s the history and foundation of the company?  What’s the mission and vision of the organization, and how do you fit into these goals?  What is the management style in the office?  What are the employer’s work expectations?  Is there room for growth?  Are you truly happy with the benefits provided?  Employers cited 67% of their bad hires as having lackluster work. But if the candidate didn’t understand the job requirements, this may be part of the problem. Understanding the job you're accepting can help ensure you're not making a poor decision in terms of fit or skills.  Job seekers are often so enthralled in simply getting a job, they forget any job isn’t the same as the right job. So, make sure you asked a lot of questions during your interview. If you’d like to hear more about processes, deadlines, managers or any job-related work, don’t hesitate to ask. This will give you a better sense of your day-to-day work, and if that work aligns with your skills and experience.  Again, it’s easy to get overzealous about accepting any job — but being honest with your employer is vital. Lying on your resume, cover letter, references or during the interview will never work in your favor. Lies, large and small, often have a way of coming back to bite you. Be upfront about anything that the employer might need to know before you’re hired.  Employers cited that 60% of their bad hires did not work well with other employees. This lack of teamwork is often due to the company culture, and if you were unaware of this culture prior to accepting the job, therein lies the problem. Always make it a point to get a sense of the company culture before accepting a job. If you don’t know enough about the culture from the website or social media accounts, ask your interviewer if you can have a quick tour of the office.  Avoid being a bad hire by having some foresight before accepting any job. Your employer will thank you for it later.  Have you ever been fired because you were a poor fit with the company? How do you recommend rectifying these situations in the future?  The Mashable Job Board connects job-seekers across the U.S. with unique career opportunities in the digital space.

        "article": "Years of legal wrangling over the racial makeup of the New York City Fire Department has led to a host of reforms, from a court-appointed monitor to a new entrance exam and an influx of recruiters into black and Hispanic neighborhoods.  On Tuesday, that long fight to diversify the overwhelmingly white department came to an end with an agreement to settle the case and pay nearly $100 million in back pay and benefits to minorities whose efforts to join the department were thwarted by what courts have ruled were institutional biases.  For Mayor Bill de Blasio, who vigorously criticized the civil rights records of both the Police and Fire Departments during his campaign last year, the decision to settle the suit represented another sharp break from the Bloomberg administration.  “The brave men and women of the F.D.N.Y. work tirelessly to keep us safe from harm’s way — and our administration is committed to ensuring every New Yorker who seeks to take on this heroic role has a fair opportunity to join the ranks,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.  Soon after taking office, Mr. de Blasio announced a settlement with civil rights groups that argued that the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices unfairly targeted minorities. He then announced that the city would no longer seek to block a new law that allowed lawsuits against individual police officers accused of racial profiling.  As part of the settlement on Tuesday, the Fire Department agreed to create a chief of diversity and inclusion, who will report directly to the fire commissioner, as well as a diversity advocate who will monitor hiring practices and cadet training for discrimination.  The department also agreed to commit to ensuring that the pool of future exam takers be proportional to the overall labor market in New York City. Out of over 42,000 people who took the last exam in 2012, over 19,000 were black, Hispanic or Asian. More than half of New York City residents identify as a member of a minority group.  The city will also pay $98 million in back pay, including $6 million in medical benefits, to those who filed claims alleging discrimination and who have already been found eligible for relief by the court.  “We are pleased with the settlement and we are optimistic that this represents a first step by the de Blasio administration to ensure that fair and equal hiring practices become the standard in the F.D.N.Y. from this day forward,” said John Coombs, the president of the Vulcan Society, which represents the black applicant who filed the original complaint against the department.  The court battle began in 2007, when the United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the department after the Vulcan Society complained that the entrance exams used by the department were biased against minority applicants.  At the time, the department was over 90 percent white and a federal judge ruled that the entrance examination was in violation of civil rights laws and the United States Constitution.  The court ordered the creation of a new exam and reforms in hiring practices, including the recruitment of some of the applicants who failed exams given in 1999 or 2002. The judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, appointed Mark S. Cohen to oversee the reforms.  However, a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled last spring that the district court judge went too far in forcing the department to revamp its hiring process.  While the city did not dispute the lower court ruling that the entrance exam was discriminatory, it challenged the notion that the discrimination was intentional. The question of whether it was intentional not only affected the reputation of the department, but also was critical in determining damages.  The appeals court ruled that there were enough questions about the impartiality of Judge Garaufis to require assigning another judge to determine whether the discrimination was intentional.  At the same time, the court left in place many of the remedies ordered by Judge Garaufis, including the appointment of a court monitor. The city has agreed to have Judge Garaufis oversee the implementation of the settlement.  Even as the litigation dragged on, a transformation began to take place in how the department recruited black and Hispanic firefighters. A new exam designed to eliminate biases against minority applicants was created under the direction of Mary Jo White, the current head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The department increased recruiting in minority neighborhoods and held special training sessions designed to prepare new recruits for the rigorous training at the academy.  From 2002 to 2013, the percentage of minorities in the department grew to 16 percent from 8 percent, according to the Fire Department.  In December, the most racially diverse cadet class in the history of the 148-year-old department graduated from the fire academy.  While the department is about 85 percent white, over 60 percent of the newly installed probationary firefighters are minorities.  “We’re pleased this case has been settled and look forward to our next firefighter exam when we hope to attract even more people of color,” said Salvatore J. Cassano, the Fire Department commissioner.  Though members of the Vulcan Society and their legal advisers praised Tuesday’s settlement, they said it was still unclear how the reforms would translate within the city’s 200 or so firehouses where efforts to diversify have been met with skepticism and sometimes hostility.  “We’ve had some really great court decisions in this case that required the city to change a lot of things,” said Darius Charney, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who has worked with the Vulcan Society. “But until those changes filter down into the firehouse and we see a change in the culture of the firehouse, a lot of this stuff is really not going to take hold.”",

Burası artık onların ikinci evi.  Çocukları, kardeşleri, ağabeyleri 15 Temmuz gecesi gerçekleşen darbe teşebbüsünün içinde yer almakla suçlanıyor.  O gece Etimesgut'taki 11. Hava Ulaştırma Komutanlığı'na taşınan bu askeri öğrencilerin aileleri ise çocuklarının, kardeşlerinin suçsuz olduğunu söylüyor.  11 Temmuz'da paraşüt eğitimi için Ankara'ya getirilen bu öğrencilerin 91'i o gece sivil kıyafetleriyle hava üssüne taşınmış, 41'i ise Ankara'da yatmak için götürüldükleri yerde bırakılmıştı.  İki ekip de geçen hafta tutuklandı. Böylece tutuklanan askeri okul öğrencilerinin sayısı 142 oldu.  Sincan Cezaevi'nin önünde BBC Türkçe'nin sorularını yanıtlayan aileler, çocuklarının darbe teşebbüsüyle ilgisinin olmadığını söylüyor, darbecilerin yargılanması, suçsuz olanların ise salıverilmesi; haklı ile haksızın ayrılması gerektiğini savunuyorlar.  Kardeşi tutuklanan ve adını vermek istemeyen biri kardeşinin ve diğerlerinin Etimesgut'taki üste beş gün boyunca ifade vermek için beklediğini söylüyor ve yaşadıkları süreci şöyle özetliyor:  \"Kardeşim, bana başlarındaki yüzbaşının hava kuvvetlerine her gün yoklama verdiğini, Genelkurmay'ın onların üste olduğundan haberi olduğunu, orada güvenli bir şekilde beklemeleri gerektiğinin söylendiğini söyledi. Onların da polisi beklediklerini söyledi. Daha sonra gözaltına alındığını duyduk. Sonra da tutuklandılar. Bir hafta emniyetin spor salonunda tutulmuşlar. Şimdi de tutuklandılar.\"  Ayrıca o gece kardeşiyle ailesi arasındaki konuşmaların da kardeşinin darbe girişiminden haberinin olmadığının göstergesi olduğunu söylüyor.  Şöyle anlatıyor o geceyi: \"Biz Ankara'da olduğumuz için evci olarak gelecekti ertesi gün. O gece babamı aradı. 'Baba terör olayları varmış sanırım. Köprü kapatılmış, bize böyle bir duyum geldi' dedi.\"  22 yaşındaki ağabeyi tutuklanan bir başkası ise, askeri okul öğrencilerinin üniformaları ve silahlarıyla değil sivil olarak Etimesgut'taki üsse taşındığını söylüyor. Bunun da onların aslında bu darbe girişiminin parçası olmadıklarının kanıtı olduğunu düşünüyorlar.  Neden tutuklanmış olabileceklerini sorduğumuzda onlar da bu sorunun yanıtını aradıklarını söylüyorlar ve ekliyorlar:  \"Bunlar komutanlarının emriyle oradalar. Yanlarında silah yok. Orada bulunduklarında üniformaları bile yok üzerinde. Sivil kıyafetleri var. Biz de soruyoruz neden buradalar diye.\"  Bu iki kardeşin talepleri ise ortak: 'Darbeciler hesap versin, ama haklı ile haksız ayrılsın.'  Peki güveniyorlar mı yargıya, devlete? \"Evet\" diyorlar. \"Devletimize güveniyoruz. Haklı ile haksızı ayıracağına inanıyoruz.\"  Kardeşinin içeride olmasının nasıl hissettirdiğini sorduğumuzda, \"15 Temmuz darbe girişiminden beri bu darbe savuşturulduğu için ülkemiz adına seviniyoruz. Ama bu sevincimizi, bu zaferimizi tam yaşayamadık. Çünkü bizim canımız içeride şu an. Tabii ki üzgünüz bütün aileler gibi\" diye açıklıyor kardeşlerden biri.  Sincan Cezaevi'nin önünde olanlardan biri de içeridekilerin devre arkadaşı. O da isminin yazılmasını istemiyor.  Onun dışarıda olmasının sebebi ise, hava harp okulunun bu devredeki öğrencilerinin diğer yarısının Yalova'da her yıl düzenlenen kampta olması.  Onlar da o gece tatbikat var denilerek kamp alanından dışarı çıkarılmak istenmiş ancak sonradan gelen bir emirle yerlerinde kalmışlar.  O an tabelasına baktığı cezaevinin içinde olmamasının tek nedenini ise şans olarak açıklıyor ve \"Ben dışarıda olduğuma sevinemiyorum, burada olduğuma sevinemiyorum. Ben ne kadar suçsuzsam onlar da o kadar suçsuz. Ya onlar da burada olsun, ya da gerekirse hepimizi alsınlar\" diyor.  Kardeşlerden bir başkası, içeriye gönderdiği üniversite hazırlık kitaplarının henüz ulaştırılmadığını söylüyor. Her şeyin yavaş işlediğini anlatıyorlar pek de şikayet etmeden. Daha çok, şu an pek çok kademede alınan güvenlik tedbirlerine anlayış hakim yaklaşımlarında.  Kardeşlerinin geleceğini, askeri okulların kapatılmasıyla alınan yeni kararların onları nasıl etkileyeceğini düşünüyor ve bunlara dikkatlerini vermeye çalışsalar da, cezaevi aşılması gereken bir engel olarak duruyor önlerinde.",

        "article": "Bobby Boswell heads in the late equalizer at Chicago on Friday, D.C. United’s 13th draw in 29 matches. (UniMas/MLS)  Five of 10 MLS matches last weekend ended in a deadlock, which isn’t so bad when you consider four featured at least four goals, there was a stoppage-time equalizer and three other tying strikes came in the last 15 minutes, including Landon Donovan’s first since returning from retirement.  [Christian Pulisic and Landon Donovan follow eerily similar paths]  Draws, however, have come at much greater frequency this season than last year and at the highest rate since 2011.  Entering the final stretch of the regular season, 96 of 292 matches — or 32.9 percent — have split points. In 2015, the figure was 21.2 percent.  The high mark in recent years was 2011: 34.7 percent. The subsequent three seasons were 23.8, 25.4 and 27.6.  This year, nine of the 10 Eastern Conference clubs have recorded more draws than either victories or defeats (or both). The exception is the Philadelphia Union (11-11-8). Saturday’s match at RFK Stadium will feature D.C. United and Orlando City with identical records: 7-9-13.  In the spring, Montreal was stuck in a four-game tie streak. Eight other teams around the league have, at some point, drawn three consecutive matches.  Just four Western teams have compiled a lopsided number of draws, though the Los Angeles Galaxy leads the league with 15 in 30 matches.  Last year, only the Colorado Rapids hit double digits in draws (10). This year, eight have already hit that mark and four others are on the brink.  The record for ties in a season was set by the Chicago Fire in 2014 with 18.  Conforming to the rest of the world, MLS has not used shootouts or extra time in the regular season since 2003 — and it has no plans to revert to a renegade system.  Draws are part of soccer. Fans are sophisticated enough to understand the value of gaining a point on the road and the disappointment of dropping points at home.  And while ties remain unsatisfying to some, they do not necessarily lack drama. Last weekend was a good example. United’s Bobby Boswell scored in stoppage time to earn a 2-2 draw at Chicago — the second time in six days that D.C. had executed a late comeback. The previous Sunday, United recovered from a two-goal deficit with goals in the 89th minute and stoppage time to knot the Red Bulls, 2-2. New York also surrendered a two-goal lead this past Sunday, settling for a 3-3 away tie with Toronto FC.  In all, 20 MLS draws this season have been scoreless. Thirty-four ties, though, have involved four or more combined goals. This month, there has been one 0-0 match and seven games of 2-2 or higher.  How does MLS stack up to the rest of the world? Last season, among the top five circuits in Europe, England’s Premier League finished with draws in 28.2 percent of the 380 matches. Germany’s Bundesliga was at 23.2, Spain’s La Liga 24.2, Italy’s Serie A 25.0 and France’s Ligue 1 with a high of 28.4.  There is no one explanation for the rash of draws in MLS this year. Parity does play a part. While other leagues allow clubs to spend and acquire players without many restrictions, MLS narrows the gap with a salary cap, drafts and other centralized mechanisms.  Chicago is last in MLS’s overall standings and has lost by multiple goals only four times. Dallas is first but has lost by multiple goals five times.  MLS has always been a balanced operation, so the recent uptick in ties is probably nothing more than, ahem, a random draw.",

A lawyer for David Collie released a copy of the video showing the July encounter with a Fort Worth officer and a Tarrant County sheriff’s deputy. The officer and deputy were off duty at the time and working a security detail together at an apartment complex, attorney Nate Washington said on Wednesday.  He said Collie was shot in the back, leaving him paralyzed.  This release of dashcam footage comes on the heels of another recording involving alleged police misconduct in Fort Worth posted on Facebook Live last week. It showed an officer aggressively arresting a woman and her two daughters.  Washington said he released the video to show that last week’s incident was not an isolated case.  “Many members of our community have been assaulted, handled roughly by Fort Worth police officers,” Washington said. “To be clear, we believe the vast majority of police officers are good and decent people.”  Police at the time were searching for two shirtless black men who they believed had committed a robbery near a gas station, Washington said. Authorities said in a news release they issued at the time that Collie had pulled a box cutter from his pocket and pointed it at the officers.  Collie was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a grand jury declined to indict him.  Fort Worth police told NBC 5 that they would not comment until an internal investigation was complete. “In order to abide by state law, there is a process that we have to follow for the fairness of all the parties involved,” the department said. “Once the investigation has concluded, we will provide you with the results.”  Collie, 33, was walking from work to a friend’s apartment when the officers approached him in the patrol vehicle, Washington said. It was the Fort Worth officer who shot Collie, Washington said, and the video appears to show the officer firing his weapon about 10 seconds after exiting the vehicle, as Collie walked away. The video was obtained about three weeks ago from the Tarrant County district attorney’s office through an open records request, Washington said.  The attorney also said he released the video on Tuesday at a news conference at Collie’s insistence because Collie was tired of comments made to his mother by people assuming he must have done something wrong.  Washington said Collie wanted to make clear he “didn’t do anything to threaten an officer”.  In the incident that prompted Washington to release the video, cellphone footage captured a white Fort Worth officer last week wrestling a black woman to the ground and then arresting her and her two daughters. The officer appeared to be argumentative and escalate the encounter with the woman, who had called police following an encounter between her son and a neighbor. The video has been viewed millions of times.  Additional reporting from the Associated Press",

At home, you think of the work you’ve left unfinished. Such a struggle is unleashed within yourself, your heart is rent. ”  Last week’s dust-up that forced Ann Romney to defend being a stay-at-home mom made me want to roll my eyes and say “This again? Really?” The Mommy Wars debate seems like something we should be so past, so over in the second decade of the 21st century. Sort of like the issue of insurance-covered contraception.  But there’s something different about the Hilary Rosen-Ann Romney conflagration. This attack on women didn’t come from a panel of men positing to know what was best for us. This was an attack on a woman’s choice, and the grenade was lobbed by another woman, another mother.  This should surprise no woman who has waited in the drop-off or pickup line at school, attended a PTA meeting or agreed to chair the Girl Scout cookie sale. For all the talk of sisterhood, for all the cooing good wishes we send on Facebook, for all the recipes we pin on Pinterest, far too many of us see motherhood as a full-contact sport, as a zero-sum game.  I don’t think we do this intentionally. When our children are young we sign up for mommy-and-me classes, looking for new friends and shared experiences. But when someone else’s little Max is rolling over, walking or — gasp — talking before your little Jake, you look for a reason — a rationalization.  ●Max’s mom stays home while you work outside the home and Jake goes to day care. It’s your fault that he’s not getting enough individual attention.  Once kids get to preschool age, the stakes get even higher.  ● The coveted spot in the pipeline-to-Harvard preschool is secured for a child whose mom has had the time to volunteer at the school and get an “in” on admissions.  ● If little Sara bites your Madison, it’s because her parents split up and her mother can’t control her.  ● How many extracurriculars your child is in becomes a high-stakes poker match. Suzy’s soccer/softball/lacrosse is a lame three-of-a-kind to another child’s full house of science fair champion/French immersion/soccer/tennis/swim team.  The problem is that the success of our children — and by extension our success as mothers — is graded on a curve. It creates a nonstop jockeying for a better position.  We need to stop keeping score. Stop keeping score of the number of times a mother who has a job that provides a paycheck calls to ask if a mother who works in the home can do the school pickup. Stop keeping score about the number of goodies put in the birthday goody bag at one child’s party. Stop keeping score of the number of play dates you host.  We all want the same thing: We want our children to be happy. My child isn’t a little happier, a little better off if your child is a little sadder, a little less well off. We need to understand that your child’s success doesn’t diminish my child.  We are all working mothers. No, scratch that, we are all mothers. That is the big thing that unites us. The things that divide us are the small things, the petty things.  It’s time to put Mommy Wars behind us, and that will only happen if each of us makes a concerted effort to judge less, understand more and recognize that we are all in this business of creating the next generation together.

        "article": "Q: My 5-year-old was called “ugly” for the first time, and I can see she is still harboring negative feelings about it. Her father and I are constantly reminding her that she is beautiful inside and out no matter what anyone says. Unfortunately for us, she really cares about what her peers say (as all kids typically do). I feel sad and sorry for her. Do I mention this to the teacher? I don’t even know who the student is. (She won’t say.)  AI am sorry. Truly. It stings when a child insults our children. We see our children (all children) as beautiful, worthy of love, special. It can baffle us when we hear statements such as this come out of preschooler mouths.  There is quite a bit of talk of how “mean girl” behavior is getting more prominent in young children. Girls who are 5, 6 and 7 are reflecting behaviors that we usually see in 10-, 11-, 12-year-old girls.  What is wrong with these younger girls? Why are they ganging up, calling each other names? Why are little girls calling your daughter ugly?  I have a couple of guesses:  Children, in general, are imitating older children. The glut of technology, television shows, clothing and services pushed onto children and families is increasing the rate at which these children are growing up. Marketers are trying to grab children as young as they can. Young girls are mimicking shows, music and YouTube videos. Some of this exposure is purely fun and sweet. Some of it helps girls mimic meanness.  Why else are younger girls becoming meaner? Too many adults are allowing them to “work it out” or have total “free play.”  The younger that children are, the closer they need to be to the caretakers in their lives. In the case of 5-year-olds, this closeness is quite literal. Yes, of course they play a bit freely with their schoolmates, but the adults need to stay close to monitor this. Not helicoptering directly over the children, j ust buzzing by.  An adult is needed nearby because 5-year-olds have poor judgment. Their prefrontal cortex is just beginning to work, and without it to regulate their feelings and thoughts, the children will blurt out any emotion that occurs to them.  Adults are needed to mitigate this.  In the absence of adults, children will join together, and a leader will emerge. (Think “Lord of the Flies.”) And the child who steps into this leadership role is usually the loudest, the bossiest, the most aggressive and the sassiest of the group (not so different from the adult world).  This dynamic can happen quickly, even right under the noses of well-intentioned adults. Which brings me to my next point: No matter what we do, children are going to hurt one another’s feelings.  Remember what I just said about the prefrontal cortex? It is untempered in young children. Although it has flashes of maturity, when a young brain is stressed, it will explode with whatever emotion it lands on first. For instance, if your daughter happened to be playing with someone with whom this particular girl wanted to play, or if your daughter got to a swing first, or anything like this, the frustrated child would explode with something mean. “Ugly” was probably just the insult du jour.  Unless you believe there is targeted and frequent violence or intimidation happening here, I am not sure that formally going to the teacher is your best bet. At most, you could casually mention that this happened and ask the teacher to keep her eyes and ears peeled.  Far more important is how you are reacting to this. When I read, “Her father and I are constantly reminding her that she is beautiful inside and out no matter what anyone says,” my eyebrow went up. Why?  I think I can see the dynamic here. Your daughter says she is feeling hurt, and Mom and Dad jump in and cheerlead her to pieces, quieting her hurt with assurances of her beauty inside and out.  Well, and I am going to say this gently, these statements are more about you than about your daughter.  You are awash in insecurity and fear that your daughter has been hurt, and the more you “assure” her, the more she pays attention to the drama and the pain. The more you pay attention to her drama and pain, the more she talks about it. And so it goes.  Am I asking you to ignore her pain? No. Just listen to her. Just sympathetically nod. If you must speak, say, “Yes, that hurt your feelings.” And then shut up. No more cheerleading.  And finally, your homework: Watch the movie “Inside Out.” Watch the deep human need for sadness and hard times.

        "article": "Planes are no place for political tirades. At least not when you are flying with Delta Air Lines.  The airline found itself on the defense after it was criticized for how it handled a belligerent passenger on a recent flight. A passenger recorded a man who went on a tirade proclaiming “we got some Hillary b—-es on here? Come on, baby. Trump!” (amid a mix of expletives) as he stood in the aisle of a Delta dal flight earlier this month. The airline was criticized because the passenger, though disruptive and bellicose, was allowed to remain on the Nov. 22 flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pennsylvania.  The video has been viewed more than two million times on Facebook alone.  On Saturday, over Thanksgiving weekend, Delta issued a statement apologizing to the passengers on the flight. But on Monday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian shared an internal memo that he sent to Delta’s staff, proclaiming that the airline would never allow that passenger to fly on another Delta plane again.  “After questioning the customer, our team members made the best decision they could given the information they had and allowed him to remain on the flight. However, if our colleagues had witnessed firsthand what was shown in the video, there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft,” wrote Bastian in a memo with the subject line “Disruptive Passenger on DL248.”  He called the passenger’s behavior “loud, rude and disrespectful to his fellow customers.” Bastian also said that Delta had to admit it made a mistake in this case so it can learn how to more effectively handle these types of situations in the further.  Bastian said that the company would refund customers the cost of their ticket for that Atlanta to Allentown flight. He also apologized to the customers.  Part of why Delta was criticized is because some travelers have been booted from airlines for far less offensive behavior—often due to racial profiling. One American Airlines flight was delayed because an Ivy League professor’s math equations looked suspicious. In another case earlier this year, a man was booted from a Southwest flight because he had been speaking Arabic.  The statement from the Delta CEO concedes that airlines have to balance remaining committed to providing safe travel for their customers, while also treating those individuals with dignity and respect. That can be a tough balancing act to achieve.  “The heightened tension in our society means that now more than ever we must require civility on our planes and in our facilities,” Bastian said. “We must stay true to Delta’s core values and treat one another with dignity and respect. We also must remain committed more than ever to the safety of our customers and our crew members. We will not tolerate anything less.",

        "article": "The proliferation of tax reductions enacted by states in recent years to lure industrial development has had very little effect on where the companies decide to put their plants, according to a national survey by an advisory group to the National Governors Association.  State taxes are such a small factor in in relocation decisions that more than half the businesses responding to the survey said they did not even know that the incentives existed in states where they had built or expanded operations.  The survey was conducted by the Council of State Planning Agencies, an arm of the governors' association. It found that factors such as access to markets and the availability of capital and labor were the overriding considerations and that the state tax incentives were largely wasted so far as attracting develoment was concerned.  ''Even where the evidence indicates that incentives are potentially a good public investment, they could be eliminated with almost an unnoticeable effect on a state's economy,'' wrote Michael Kieschnick, who conducted the survey.  Over the past few years, state governments have been avidly competing for industrial development by offering tax write-offs to corporations for opening plants or expanding old ones. Frequently, incentives have been enacted at the cost of many millions of dollars in revenue.  At the forefront of the movement are Northern industrial states that have been losing jobs to the South and West. New York, for example, has the highest tax reductions for new and expanded industries in the nation.  The findings are expected to give new ammunition to public officials who have opposed the use of tax incentives as a way of attracting industry from other states.  Yet the movement has so much political force that the new evidence is not considered likely to quell it. Robert Wise, director of the Council of State Planning Agencies, said that political leaders felt compelled to take some action that would seem to save jobs, particularly in economically depressed areas. Minnesota as an Example  In Minnesota, Gov. Albert H. Quie, a Republican, has been under pressure to sponsor tax incentives for business even as the state has been struggling to meet an anticipated deficit of $800 million. The drive for incentives, Mr. Quie and others have said, cannot easily be dismissed because of the widespread perception that business has been leaving the state because of its high taxes.  Tax incentives as a means of attracting or keeping industry within a state are part of a larger movement that became widespread in the late 1970's. Public officials at all levels became disillusioned with the use of public projects to enhance development. They sought instead to stimulate employment by lowering and abating taxes, providing training and subsidies for private workers and providing land and facilities for private development.  On the state level by 1980, a complex of incentives had been written into the tax codes. Forty-six states exempted from the sales tax raw material used in production. Thirty-one had sales tax exemptions for new industrial equipment. And 15 provided tax credits for business investments and hiring for new and expanding industries.  The state tax laws are so complex and diverse that no one has calculated the total revenue loss involved. But Mr. Kieschnick estimated that in 14 states in 1977 investment and employment incentives alone cost $173 million. Previous Data Called Flawed  The results of the survey were published by the planning council in a report entitled ''Taxes and Growth: Business Incentives and Economic Development.'' Mr. Kieschsnick, who is now economic policy director for Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, contended that previous research on the effectiveness of incentives was flawed.  He sent more than 2,000 questionnaires to companies that had made investments in 1979 in 10 states that had tax incentives to lure industry: New York, Delaware, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Massachusetts, Kansas, Rhode Island, West Virginia and North Dakota. He received 419 responses.  The companies were asked to rate the relative importance of a range of factors in their decision to locate in a particular state. The results were broken down into three categories: new companies deciding where to locate, those expanding in other states and those establishing new plants in various states.  A number of factors ranked ahead of taxes. ''Among new firms,'' Mr. Kieschnick said, ''less than a fifth were aware that incentives existed in the state of their actual location. Among expansions, 36 percent were aware of the incentives. Among new branch plants, half of the firms were aware of state tax incentives.'' 'A Pleasant Windfall' for States  After eliminating the companies that located in a state without even knowing of the tax incentives, Mr. Kieschnick concluded that ''3.3 percent of the new firms, none of the expansions and 6.3 percent of the new branch plants indicated they would have located in another state in the absence of tax incentives.  ''Tax incentives do appear to influence some firms, but very few,'' Mr. Kieschnick wrote. ''For the great majority, the reduced taxes represent a pleasant windfall.''  The council's study did not get into the question of how local taxes affect the location of industry within a state, in a central city or in a suburban or rural area. A number of studies have shown, however, that for the vast majority of businesses a tax incentive is not a major factor.  The Reagan Administration is reported to be on the verge of proposing the establishment of ''enterprise zones'' in depressed areas that would attract business investment through the abatement of taxes and regulation.  That proposal, officials say, may put tax incentives to their ultimate test, because the amount to be written off, in Federal as well as local taxes, would be much larger and potentially more attractive to industry than what the states and local governments have been offering.",

The state average is 23%, and it's as low as 12% in some communities outside Wisconsin.  \"I think availability of alcohol, price of alcohol, is a factor as well. In Wisconsin, it's very inexpensive to purchase and drink alcohol compared to other states. So the availability and price I think do factor in,\" Eggebrecht said.  24/7 Wall Street also ranked the driest cities in America. CLICK HERE for that list.

        "article": "Two days after CBC News reported on the potential danger of decaying stained-glass windows in the House of Commons, repairs on some of those windows are beginning.  On Wednesday, CBC News revealed an internal government report warned crumbling brickwork and loose window glass pose a \"potentially catastrophic,\" life-threatening risk to members of Parliament and others.  The danger isn't just hypothetical. In 2012, workers found a heavy piece of glass that had apparently plummeted to the Commons floor overnight when no one was around. The panel was from one of 12 tall stained glass windows installed in the early 1970s.  On Friday, an email went out to House of Commons staff informing them \"preliminary work\" would be done to repair three windows in the west gallery — those depicting scenes from Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.  The work is scheduled to begin Friday and continue through Oct 19.  A spokeswoman for Public Works said the repairs have been in the works for weeks, and had been planned to coincide with the Commons' Thanksgiving break next week.  \"We are now proceeding to address the next set of windows and doing the work during the Thanksgiving break week,\" Annie Trepanier wrote in an email to CBC News.  Trepanier‎ explained that the work involves creating stencils of the existing windows and laminating them to temporary glass windows that will be installed while the originals are repaired.  Public Works told CBC News earlier this week that workers had already removed the three most dangerous windows, and were monitoring the nine others that line the Commons chamber.  The internal report also warned of loose bricks in the roof area of the Commons foyer, just outside the chamber, that could fall on people. The email to staff makes no mention of plans to repair it.  CBC News learned of the problems in a 177-page internal report written last year and obtained under the Access to Information Act. It found the 12 stained-glass windows were improperly installed in the Commons chamber.  An internal report for Public Works also warned loose bricks in the roof of the Commons foyer could crash through the decorative glass ceiling, injuring people standing below. (Julie Van Dusen/CBC)  Water damage and poorly fitted framing has since loosened the glass as well as the surrounding bricks and stonework.  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair expressed concern about the report's findings.  \"When you walk through the corridors upstairs, you can see lots of water damage, you can see things that are simply not taken care of,\" Mulcair said Wednesday following a caucus meeting in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill, where the Commons is located.  \"I don't want to take anything away from the amazing women and men who work here every day. There's a huge team that keeps our Parliament functioning.  \"But it's quite clear to anyone who takes the trouble to look around that there's been a lot of neglect. There's been a lot of neglect in some of our heritage buildings in Canada. That's a sad fact.\"  Public Works responded to CBC's initial report by saying it had already carried out the most pressing repairs and was closely monitoring any remaining problems to guard against any health and safety risks.",

        "article": "Shoppers visited the large shop which filled two floors to grab last minute bargins  THESE pictures show the desolate shop floor of a doomed BHS store as shoppers arrived to snap up last minute bargains.  The slogan ‘Everything Must Go’ was meant literally as clothes, mannequins and even shelves were strewn around with discounts of up to 70 per cent off.  Very few staff could be seen working at the shop in Cambridge, Cambs., on Monday while a handful of customers browsed the scarce stock before the store disappeared from the high street for good.  Mum-of-one Stacey Smith, 28, said: “It was all very subdued in there to be honest, there was very little stock left and it all just felt empty.  “There were barely any staff working and the ones who were just seemed dejected. I can’t imagine it’s a fun place to work at the moment, knowing you’re going to lose your job.  “All there was left to buy was cushions and candles and ladies’ underwear. It’s a sorry state of affairs really.”  A House of Commons paper into the collapsed chain last week delivered a withering verdict on the high street’s biggest tycoon – previous owner Sir Philip Green, who famously sold the chain for £1.  The Department of Work and Pensions and Business Committees report branded the fiasco “the unacceptable face of capitalism”.  Sir Philip bought BHS for £200 million in March 2000, but last year the company was sold to city investors, Retail Acquisitions, for £1 by the Arcadia Group.  He has come under fire for telling an employee “I own you” and has been called “evil” by a Labour MP calling for him to “face up” to his actions in the fallout of the superstore’s collapse.  Stacey said the BHS store in Cambridge is due to close this week.  “There were signs up everywhere to say it would be closed by Wednesday,” she said.  “I don’t know what will happen to the space now but it’s in a really good location within the shopping centre and within Cambridge so I’m sure someone will snap it up.  “I’ve always liked what BHS have to offer so I will definitely be sad to see it go.”  The mass sale comes after news that all 164 BHS stores in the UK will cease trading by August 30.  Most stores are offering 50 per cent discounts on stock in light of the company’s devastating demise, which comes after business tycoon Green controversially sold the company for £1 last year.  Calls have been made for the multi-millionaire to lose his knighthood over the ongoing saga – which has seen thousands of hard-working Brits in the lurch.  The firm is now looking to sell the stores off shop by shop.  We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team? Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368.",

        "article": "Perhaps no modern presidential son-in-law in-waiting has been more in the spotlight than Jared Kushner. The “de facto campaign manager,” and a key member of the transition team, Kushner is reportedly angling for a position in the Trump administration.  But here’s something you might not know: Jared Kushner’s younger brother, Joshua, is the cofounder of a startup trying to capitalize on the Affordable Care Act — which Donald Trump has vowed to move quickly to dismantle.  Josh Kushner is a 31-year-old venture capitalist on the fast track. He’s been called “a modern-day Vanderbilt,” “the boy wonder VC,” and “your mother’s dream man.” He’s dating supermodel Karlie Kloss — Taylor Swift’s best friend — who posted a photo of herself on Instagram voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hashtag #ImWithHer.” (Josh Kushner reportedly didn’t vote for Trump either.)  If that’s not awkward enough, Josh Kushner counts Peter Thiel, the contrarian Silicon Valley venture capitalist, among his loyal investors.  Thiel, you’ll remember, donated to Trump’s campaign, spoke at the Republican National Convention, and now sits alongside Jared Kushner on the Trump transition executive committee.  Changes to the Affordable Care Act seem certain, and they will surely affect Kushner’s startup, Oscar Health, which sells individual policies to customers in several states.  Oscar Health is in many ways a poster child for the problems of the health care law. The privately held company has lost $128 million in three states so far this year, following a $105 million loss in 2015, according to Bloomberg. It’s bowing out of two marketplaces, in Dallas and New Jersey, and restructuring its hospital and physician networks elsewhere.  In February it expects to begin selling insurance to small companies. Entering that market, which doesn’t depend on the Affordable Care Act, has been part of Oscar’s long-term plans from the start.  But since so much of Oscar Health’s business hinges on the health law, its fortunes will be shaped, in part, by the Trump administration’s decisions on the Affordable Care Act.  Oscar Health, Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Born into a New Jersey real estate dynasty, Josh Kushner was a freshman at Harvard when his father, Charles, went to prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion, witness tampering, and illegal campaign contributions. The father’s absence left Jared Kushner to run the family business.  Josh Kushner had a brief stint at Goldman Sachs after graduation. He then went to Harvard Business School, where he met the two men with whom he would start Oscar, named after Josh Kushner’s Eastern European great-grandfather.  Investors have poured more than $700 million into Oscar Health so far, and the company was recently valued at an eye-popping $2.7 billion.  But the individual market has proved a tough nut to crack.  “They’ve been met with the reality that it’s difficult to control health care costs, and it’s difficult to control people with chronic diseases, and just hanging out a shingle with a really cool logo is not enough to do it,” said Les Funtleyder, a health care investor at E Squared Asset Management, which has a holding in Oscar competitor UnitedHealth Group.  A rising star in venture capital, Josh Kushner has made 30-under-30, 35-under-35, and 40-under-40 lists of executives to track. He’s closely watched by the tabloids, thanks to his four-years-and-counting romance with Kloss. And he’s something of a regular on the high-brow conference speaking circuit.  In one appearance at an event nearly two years ago, sitting beside Theranos chief executive Elizabeth Holmes and former president Bill Clinton, Josh Kushner provocatively declared there are “a lot of people” in the health care industry who are “just evil.”  Glamour aside, he cultivates an image as a wonky, mild-mannered workaholic. In one interview he said he moved to an apartment two blocks from his office because he was too often sleeping at his desk overnight.  He’s also kept a low profile as Trump’s rise has spurred curiosity about the Kushner family. Through a spokesperson, Josh Kushner told Esquire magazine before the election that he has been a Democrat his entire life and would not be voting for Trump. The spokesperson also said that Josh Kushner loves his brother and did not want to say anything that would embarrass him.  Josh Kushner and his partners timed the 2013 launch of Oscar Health with the implementation of the health law, which created state exchanges where consumers can enroll in insurance plans. The company sought an edge by targeting millennials with playful ads and a Silicon Valley vibe.  Oscar Health has also built ties to Obama’s team. During its first year, the company reportedly turned to several campaign operatives from President Obama’s reelection campaign to aid open enrollment.  Last year the White House trumpeted an online video from Oscar highlighting the affordability of health insurance. “We are incredibly motivated by the support the White House has shown us today on this initiative,” the company said in the video.  Oscar said in a statement after the election that “we can’t speculate” on what the results mean for the Affordable Care Act, but “we hope and expect that the new administration will keep the spirit of consumer choice and competition alive in the marketplace.”  Experts on the health law said it’s unlikely Trump’s win will directly spell either doom or boon for Oscar Health.  Its future, like that of other insurers, depends on how the market for individual plans fares — and that depends on what Trump proposes for a replacement, said Katherine Hempstead, who specializes in health policy at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  The Trump administration could boost Oscar, particularly if Republicans can manage to fix some of the problems with the health care law. But Oscar could take a hit if the GOP reduces the public subsidy for coverage. It could also be hurt if fewer people sign up for health plans — although new federal data show the pace of enrollment up considerably since Trump’s election.",

        "article": "A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options.  In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature.  “A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups — Lambda Legal; the American Civil Liberties Union and the A.C.L.U. of Texas; the National Center for Lesbian Rights; the Transgender Law Center; and G.L.B.T.Q. Legal Advocates & Defenders — said in their statement.  The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and is likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling.  Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates.  Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case.  If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuit’s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent.  The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace.  In May, in the latest such statement, the federal Justice and Education Departments issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused could lose federal funds.  “A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so,” the letter stated.  The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action.  The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing sex-discrimination protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid.  The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it had failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a “new mandate” that “harms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authority” and jeopardizing “billions of dollars in federal funding.”  The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on the merits.  If the administration brought action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court.  “There is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,” said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. “The government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit, and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the government’s interpretation of the law is correct or not.”  Follow Erik Eckholm on Twitter: @eckholm.

        "article": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- As Pakistan started three days of national mourning Wednesday, the Taliban said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers' children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers' footsteps and target militants.  Terrorists ambushed the school in Peshawar on Tuesday, explosives strapped to their bodies, and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams.  They sprayed bullets rapidly, killing 145 people. Of those, 132 were children, authorities said.  In an email, the terror group warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas.  It accused the students at the army school of \"following the path of their fathers and brothers to take part in the fight against the tribesmen\" nationwide.  The Army Public School and Degree College is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar. The public school admits children whose parents are in the military, but its classes are not restricted to future soldiers.  A day after the massacre, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism cases.  Who are the Pakistani Taliban?  'Under the benches ... kill them'  Student Ahmed Faraz, 14, recalled the moment the terrorists struck. He was in the auditorium when about five people burst in through a back door and started firing.  \" 'God is great,' \" the militants shouted as they roared through the hallways, Ahmed said.  They sought out terrified children.  \" 'A lot of the children are under the benches,' \" a Pakistan Taliban member said, according to Ahmed. \" 'Kill them.' \"  The ninth-grader got shot in his left shoulder and lay under a bench.  \"My shoulder was peeking out of the bench,\" Ahmed recalled. \"They went into another room, (and when) I ran to the exit, I fell.\"  Seventh-grader Mohammad Bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted. He fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety.  Students, teachers recount the horror they saw  Pakistani troops eventually pushed through the buildings, room by room, and confined the attackers to four buildings.  They found children drenched in blood. Some of the bodies lay on top of others.  \"Even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror,\" said Khawaja Asif, the defense minister. \"The smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry.\"  By the time the siege ended in the evening, military officials said all seven militants were dead. It's unclear whether they were killed by soldiers or they detonated their explosives. The casualty tolls don't include the terrorists.  The ambush at Army Public School and Degree College left more than 100 injured, many with gunshot wounds, according to Mushtaq Ghani, a spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.  It started with a ruse  The nightmare began in late morning, when a car exploded behind the school. Pakistani authorities said the blast was a ruse to divert security guards' attention.  Gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades eight, nine and 10 have classes.  The militants came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive, a Pakistani military official said.  Most of those killed were between the ages of 12 and 16, said Pervez Khattak, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital.  Some adults were also targeted, including a 28-year-old office assistant who was shot and burned alive, police official Faisal Shehzad said.  Pakistani authorities said the attackers' goal was to kill, not take captives.  While lifting a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases, the Prime Minister expressed frustration about failed talks.  \"We tried dialogue with these militants, we reopened the door to talks,\" Sharif said. \"It was unsuccessful ... there was no other option than to engage in an operation against these people.\"  He did not mention any specific terror groups. But the Pakistan Taliban and the government have been involved in peace talks in the past. Pakistan released 19 Taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture, but talks broke down after a wave of militant attacks.  Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan.  It is the home base of the Pakistan Taliban, known as the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan or TTP, which seeks to enforce its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan. The group has battled Pakistani troops and attacked civilians, including in Peshawar, an ancient city of more than 3 million people.  And the Taliban haven't hesitated to go after schoolchildren. Their most notable target is Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot in October 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls. The teenage girl survived and became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize last week for her efforts to promote education and girls' rights.  Yousafzai said the attack left her heartbroken.  \"Innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this,\" she said.  Afghan Taliban slam Pakistan counterparts  This is the deadliest incident inside Pakistan since October 2007, when 139 Pakistanis died and more than 250 others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database.  Even the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are closely affiliated with their Pakistani counterparts, criticized the killing of women and children as against Islamic teaching.  The spokesman for the Afghan terror group expressed condolences to the victims of Tuesday's attack.  CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, along with journalists Saleem Mehsud, Zahir Shah and Adeel Raja, and CNN's Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta.

        "article": "“The Lady,” Luc Besson’s worshipful film about the Myanmar opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, arrives at a propitious moment. In the real world Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi — played by Michelle Yeoh and referred to as Suu in the movie — was elected to Parliament earlier this month, one of the latest signs that Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) may be moving in a democratic direction after a half-century of military dictatorship.  Mr. Besson’s movie, while it does not include these very recent developments, nonetheless angles toward an optimistic conclusion. Stories of heroic, self-sacrificing resistance seem to work best if there is at least a provisional happy ending, since their common theme is hope in the face of repression and injustice.  But while the screen versions of such stories tend to be reliably inspiring, they are also frequently unsatisfying. Richard Attenborough’s noble, earnest and finally exhausting “Gandhi” is perhaps the supreme modern example, and while “The Lady” is nowhere near as lavish or as long, it similarly paralyzes history and human drama with relentless hagiography.  An early scene depicts the death of Suu’s father, Aung San, a nationalist hero crucial to securing Burma’s independence from Britain, who was assassinated by rivals in the Burmese army in 1947, when his daughter was a child.  The drama of the event is powerfully conveyed — Mr. Besson has a Spielbergian flair for creating emotion through cross-cutting — but its political meaning is blurry, except insofar as it represents the empowerment of the bad guys.  They are still around in the 1990s, when most of the action of “The Lady” takes place. In 1988 Suu returns to Burma from her home in Oxford, England, to attend to her dying mother. Suu’s presence causes discomfort for the ruthless, paranoid and superstitious generals who rule the country. They would like to be rid of her, but her prominence, her international connections and the reluctance to create another martyr like Aung San prevent them from using the usual violent methods. Instead, Suu is invited to leave the country and then, when she refuses, is placed under a house arrest that will stretch, in various forms, over two decades.  Suu’s confinement gives Mr. Besson’s film a claustrophobic intensity, but it also threatens to constrain his restless visual energy. A glance at his previous work as a director — it includes “La Femme Nikita,” “The Fifth Element” and “Leon: The Professional” — confirms that this is not a filmmaker with a gift for standing still or moving slowly, and he seems a bit at sea in a narrative that is, above all, a celebration of heroic patience. The chronology lurches back and forth as Mr. Besson tries to turn Suu’s stubbornness into an engine of dramatic momentum.  Though she is isolated in her family’s compound in the capital, Suu is not alone in “The Lady.” While it is a chronicle of political courage, the film is also a love story, illuminating the remarkable relationship between Suu and her husband, a British academic named Michael Aris. Played by David Thewlis, Michael is in some ways a more vivid character than the serene, indomitable Suu, whose international fame traps Ms. Yeoh in biopic nobility. Michael, floppy haired and wry, is a classically eccentric don with a very British stiff upper lip. He is devoted to Suu and to her cause, successfully promoting her candidacy for a Nobel Peace Prize and trying, less fruitfully, to outwit the Myanmar authorities who are keeping them apart.  Their separation is made all the more painful by the terminal cancer diagnosis Michael receives early in the film, though relatively late in the period it spans. (Mr. Aris died at 53 in 1999.) And yet the movie’s unstinting commitment to emphasizing their goodness — the evident awe in which Mr. Besson and the screenwriter, Rebecca Frayn, hold their subjects — has the effect of blunting the impact of their story.  Tears are shed, but no inkling of doubt or tension is allowed to penetrate the aura of idealistic selflessness that shrouds Suu and Michael. And somehow the audience is never permitted to appreciate the depth and profundity of their shared commitment to Myanmar. Similarly, while the movie shows the brutal treatment of Suu’s colleagues in the human rights movement, it does not explore the struggle, discipline and internal friction that are essential to successful political resistance. One result is a film that is programmatically inspirational but not quite as inspiring as it should be.  “The Lady” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some violence and torture, more implied than shown.  Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.  Directed by Luc Besson; written by Rebecca Frayn; director of photography, Thierry Arbogast; edited by Julien Rey; music by Éric Serra; production design by Hugues Tissandier; costumes by Olivier Bériot; produced by Virginie Besson-Silla and Andy Harries; released by Cohen Media Group. Running time: 2 hours 7 minutes.  WITH: Michelle Yeoh (Daw Aung San Suu Kyi), David Thewlis (Michael Aris), Jonathan Raggett (Kim), Jonathan Woodhouse (Alex), Susan Wooldridge (Lucinda), Benedict Wong (Karma), Htun Lin (General Ne Win) and Agga Poechit (Than Shwe).",

        "article": "RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan—Every morning, Masayuki Kimura's eyes pop open at 3 a.m., and he can't get back to sleep. It has been the same ever since the day a tsunami ripped through his hometown and upended his life.  More than seven months ago, Masayuki Kimura watched from a hilltop as his sweets shop and factory in Rikuzentakata, Japan were destroyed by a massive tsunami. Now he's trying to figure out how to start over. WSJ's Linda Blake reports.  Masayuki Kimura and his sister pulled ganzuki, a sweetened steam bread with a consistency of chewy pancakes, out of the oven inside the temporary kitchen.  The owner of a traditional sweets shop here, Mr. Kimura lost nearly everything when the waves swept over Rikuzentakata March 11, obliterating much of the town. All that remains of his family business—a local landmark that went back three generations—is the base of a stone wall running down into a drain overrun with weeds. Across the street is a patch of dirt where Mr. Kimura's home once stood.  \"I still wake up expecting to find out this was all a bad dream,\" Mr. Kimura said recently.  Sleepless nights are only part of the struggle for the 54-year-old Mr. Kimura, who after the disaster faced a dilemma common across Japan's tsunami zone: whether to rebuild, or walk away and move on.  Hardly a thriving town before the tsunami, Rikuzentakata lost nearly 10% of its population in the disaster and an even greater percentage may soon leave in search of jobs, homes or medical care. About 80% of the businesses were destroyed. With neither a highway nor a bullet train running through it, and so much devastation, some residents have all but given up on the place.  Mr. Kimura had his own personal reasons to consider packing it in. Like many younger residents, he left Rikuzentakata 35 years ago for college believing it was the first step to a life as a globetrotter, only to get lured back after graduation when his parents convinced him to take over the family business. The disaster, he thought, might be a chance to start again.  But as the months went by, Mr. Kimura had an unexpected epiphany: His business, which he thought was inconsequential, mattered to a lot of people. Neighbors, even strangers, kept asking: When would he bake his sweets again? He realized maybe his life's work had meant something to the town after all—and it was part of what made it worth saving.  A stubborn determination to rebuild took hold. And it didn't let go.  Mr. Kimura woke up early on the morning of March 11 to get a head start on a busy day. He had a big order to fill—100 steaming sweet buns stuffed with red bean paste—before finishing his taxes ahead of a looming deadline.  At 2:46 p.m., the ground delivered a jolt unlike any he had ever felt. He ran from his home across the street to the store and told his 81-year-old mother and a remaining employee that a tsunami was likely on its way. The employee, Setsuko Murakami, a 25-year shop veteran, ran to an evacuation center and was never seen again.  With his mother, Mr. Kimura fled to the neighborhood's designated evacuation center—a temple atop a steep hill. His wife and son joined them there later. From the higher vantage point, he watched two giant waves thrash the shop, a sturdy stone structure that had withstood a fire and several powerful earthquakes during its eight-decade history. The third wave was the biggest, a monstrous wall of water that multiplied the force of the previous two and submerged his store. When the water receded, everything had vanished.  \"The whole city got swallowed up and it looked like the end of the world,\" he said.  That night, Mr. Kimura was overcome by despair. He had watched the destruction of his hometown and had no idea how many friends and neighbors were still alive. Not only was his shop gone, so were all his recipes and baking equipment which were customized and perfected over the years. The only thing that didn't disappear into the ocean was $370,000 worth of loans. \"I figured we were finished,\" he said.  Mr. Kimura resigned himself to giving up. He told people he was moving to southern Japan to become an olive farmer. People laughed, but he was thinking about a chance for a fresh start. He considered another profession. He also had offers from friends to move out of Rikuzentakata and open a sweets shop in another part of Japan.  His mother, an energetic woman despite her age, spoke up. After the disaster, national broadcaster NHK went live from evacuation centers to give refugees a chance to tell friends and family they were OK. When it was Ms. Kimura's turn to speak, she had a different message: \"I can't wait to make delicious sweets again. We will rebuild.\"  People began telling Mr. Kimura they had seen his mother on TV, and were looking forward to eating his sweets again.  There were large obstacles to consider, though. He lost a book in the shop's kitchen containing 150 recipes, some dating back to the store's opening. Backup copies were on computers that had also been washed away. Although he remembered about 30 recipes, he worried he might not be able to reproduce the taste that made his sweets so well-known.  \"It's not that I don't want to do it, but it's hard to be brimming with confidence when I think about all the hurdles,\" he said in May. \"If I was 10 years younger, I can say I'd definitely rebuild. If I was 10 years older, I'd probably pack it in. But I'm stuck in the middle.\"  One of his earliest memories, Mr. Kimura recalled, is the smell of sweet buns wafting from the ovens of his parents ground floor bakery up to his bedroom on the second floor.  Founded by his grandfather, Yousaku Kimura, in 1926, the Kimuraya bakery specialized in local traditional Japanese sweets, like ganzuki, a sweetened steam bread with a consistency of chewy pancakes. When he was 5 years old, Mr. Kimura remembers making the buns in the bakery with his parents and bringing them to his nursery school teachers as presents.  His grandfather, who had no sons, felt so strongly about keeping the business in the family that he adopted his wife's sister's son, Mr. Kimura's father, to take over the shop and carry on the family name.  In middle school and high school, Mr. Kimura helped out making deliveries and managing supplies. His father taught him how to make dough, like the rice flour and sugar mixture for yubeshi, a gelatinous tube-like dessert that was a house specialty. His mother taught him techniques to wrap the dough into perfect shapes.  When it came time to go to college, Mr. Kimura left Rikuzentakata for Kyoto and studied business at Doushisha University, one of the top private colleges in western Japan. He traveled the world during this time, visiting the U.S., France, Germany and Austria. In his senior year, he made it to the final round of interviews with a major advertising agency for a job in a big city or possibly abroad.  A few weeks before he was to hear about the job, he received a letter from his mother begging him to come home and give up advertising. She said his parents worked hard to build the business so they could one day pass it on to him. He felt like he had no choice.  \"I thought I could go out into the world and do something bigger,\" he said. He returned to Rikuzentakata, but the decision gnawed at him—especially at college reunions.  \"All my classmates seemed to be doing something great and here I was in the boondocks,\" said Mr. Kimura.  He settled into life in his hometown. At 28, he married a high-school classmate, Junko, and they had three children. It took him years to master the family recipes. He sometimes worked 16 hours a day, but barely managed to eke out a profit.  After a month in an evacuation center following the tsunami, Mr. Kimura moved his wife and middle son, 25, into a rented home in Esashi, an inland town in Iwate prefecture. (His oldest son and youngest daughter live near Tokyo.) In daily commutes to Rikuzentakata with his wife, he navigated a light blue Nissan compact—a donation from his daughter's boss—90 minutes through mountain roads. He helped distribute supplies at evacuation centers while his wife found a job as a music teacher at a Rikuzentakata school.  Mr. Kimura wore donated clothes for the first two months: faded jeans, a black Champion sweatshirt and running shoes. His graying hair sat disheveled on his head and receded slightly from his forehead, while his metal-rimmed glasses framed his droopy eyes.  One day, Mr. Kimura—known by his childhood nickname of \"Ma-chan\"—was handing out desserts sent by his former college classmates from famous sweet shops across Japan.  An elderly woman, a regular customer at Kimuraya, said she was grateful for the gift, but she yearned to eat his sweets again. Others came forward saying the same thing.  \"I realized it's not important whether the sweets are famous or not. People are longing for our local taste,\" he said.  Around mid-May, he began looking more seriously into rebuilding. Mr. Kimura met with bankers who agreed to suspend his loan repayment for one year and possibly extend a second loan for rebuilding. A government agency offered to build temporary stores and provide two years' worth of rent if the business owners paid utility bills and found a plot of land. Mr. Kimura found an empty field belonging to his cousin, alongside a road that has now become one of Rikuzentakata's main thoroughfares.  Mr. Kimura still needed equipment, which he estimated would cost about $65,000. After weeks of fruitless searching, he got a call from a supplier who said a pastry shop in neighboring Akita prefecture was closing.  In late July, Mr. Kimura drove 2½ hours to see the 67-year-old shop owner, Yukimitsu Tsuruoka, who was shutting his doors because his wife was sick. Mr. Kimura inspected the oven—a model similar to the one he used to have—as well as rolling tables, a mixer and a display case.  Mr. Tsuruoka said Mr. Kimura could take it all for ¥600,000, or $7,800. It was a huge discount but Mr. Tsuruoka said he was happy to play a part in helping Mr. Kimura. Over a Japanese box lunch, Mr. Tsuruoka offered some advice.  \"You should work while you can. For men, they are happiest when they are working,\" Mr. Tsuruoka said.  Mr. Kimura moved back to Rikuzentakata in August. He rented a home for his family, including his mother, who was deeply affected by the tsunami. After her pronouncements on TV, she couldn't speak for a month. She worked with a therapist, and her mood improved and she regained her speech.  Rikuzentakata, though, remained in ruins. Hardly any of the city's small businesses were reopening, and the main downtown area was a ghost town of empty lots and gutted structures.  Other business owners had their own tough decisions to make. A miso maker in his neighborhood left the city and moved his pregnant wife and young daughter to the northern region of Hokkaido to work at a larger miso company there. Yagisawa Shoten, a well-known soy sauce maker in the city, moved its company headquarters to a town an hour outside Rikuzentakata and restarted operations one month after the disaster. The city's biggest natural-gas provider decided rebuilding would be too much and moved out of the city.  Mr. Kimura still needed final approval from the government to get funding to build a new store, even though it was unclear when construction could start—or if there would be enough customers.  Soon, however, Mr. Kimura began seeing glimmers of progress. Late in August, he participated in a \"revival\" festival where small businesses could sell goods. His booth sold rice crackers and sweet buns from a factory elsewhere in Japan to a crowd of more than 10,000.  Dressed in bluejeans, a green T-shirt and a yellow towel wrapped around his head, Mr. Kimura felt invigorated. \"It feels good to be back in business again,\" he said.  He had decided not to sell his trademark sweets because he wasn't sure if he could replicate the taste using a borrowed kitchen. He didn't think people would care.  But he was scolded by local customers and people who came from all over Japan expecting to eat his famous ganzuki and yubeshi.  \"Because of this disaster, I came to realize how much people in this area loved our sweets,\" he said afterward. \"I have an obligation to start my business as soon as possible.\"  In September, Mr. Kimura reached out to a Tokyo investment fund that collects investments of as little as ¥10,000 from sponsors who want to support businesses affected by the disaster.  To pitch the case for Kimuraya, Mr. Kimura created a 10-year business plan that included plans to return sales to predisaster levels in three years at a temporary location and rebuild the original store in the fourth year. He wrote a letter on the fund's website, pleading his case: \"There are some people who say that Rikuzentakata is doomed. However, we will never give up.\"  Upon learning the temporary store wouldn't be ready until December because of approval and construction delays, Mr. Kimura converted a borrowed cargo-train car retrofitted with sinks and glass doors to serve as a kitchen.  Equipment started showing up on online auction sites, allowing him to buy another mixer, a steamer oven and a gas boiler. Some sellers refused to accept his money or cut the price when they found out he was from Rikuzentakata. Others offered to pay delivery charges.  \"These are total strangers and they are supporting me. The best way for me to repay them is to get my business running as soon as possible,\" he said.  By mid-October, Mr. Kimura's initial doubts were gone. Though the location for the temporary shop was still surrounded by empty lots and pulverized debris, he had set up his trailer, installed equipment, and hooked up the gas, electricity and water.  Orders were trickling in. A local temple wanted 300 sweet buns. A university in Tokyo wanted sweets for a fair.  \"I feel a lot of pressure, but it's good because it helps me move forward,\" he said.  On Oct. 18, seven months and a week after the tsunami, Mr. Kimura was back in the kitchen with his mother at his side for a trial run. Re-energized by the challenge of baking again, she had finally recovered from the trauma.  He started with ganzuki, the steamed sweetbread he first helped make as a child.  Mr. Kimura rolled up the sleeves of his yellow and blue plaid shirt. A white flour handprint stained the front pocket of his gray slacks. \"I forgot to order my chef's uniform,\" he said.  Working from memory and his mother's notes, Mr. Kimura measured out sugar, soy sauce and water and placed the ingredients into the mixer. He added flour and baking powder, and poured the light brown batter into a shallow wooden box lined with a cloth. He stuck his finger in the batter for a taste and frowned. \"Too light,\" he said.  The batter was topped with walnuts and placed into the steamer oven. After several minutes, the batter started to rise, but not to Mr. Kimura's satisfaction.  \"We have the amounts wrong. This can't be right,\" he said. After an hour, he pulled the tray out of the steamer. \"It's a failure,\" he said.  He decided they needed to add less baking powder, more powder oil and double the ingredients.  As he worked, there were reminders of what went missing in the tsunami. There were no hot gloves to handle the trays. The bowls were too small. There were no seats in the rail car.  He adjusted the recipe, jotting down numbers in a notebook. Another batch went back in the steamer. After an hour, he pulled out the ganzuki. The bread was fluffy and held its shape better than the previous one.  \"This one is splendid,\" his mother said.  As the late-afternoon sun started to fade, they planned for the next day. He wanted to make steam buns in the morning and try yubeshi in the afternoon.  With steam rising from the sweet bread, Mr. Kimura paused to consider some lessons from his work—and the slow reconstruction of his hometown.  \"In making sweets, things never happen the way you imagine it,\" he said. \"And everything seems to take longer than we imagine.\"  Write to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com",

City Councilman Ruben Wills has been indicted on charges of stealing thousands of dollars in taxpayer money. But that hasn’t stopped Principal Rushell White from displaying giant replica checks with his name and John Hancock to tout the city funding he has steered to the South Ozone Park middle school.  “The staff always felt it was kind of weird,” a school insider said. “They’ve been on display for the past couple years. It’s the first thing anybody sees when they come into the building.”  One staffer said the checks amounted to “electioneering.”  “This is just for community notification of the hard work that we’ve done,” Wills told The Post. “It’s totally appropriate.”  Under Department of Education regulations, “no material supporting any [political] candidate . . . may be distributed, posted, or displayed in any school building.”  Yet at JHS 226, in what resembles a shrine to the pol, the huge checks are tacked on a wall above the entrance to the auditorium.  The checks show sums of $200,000, $300,000, $350,000 and $425,000 — a total of $1.275 million. According to city records, Wills earmarked $1.425 million to JHS 226 over three years.  One display features a photo of Wills smiling at a student with an American flag backdrop. Another shows a stately-looking Wills.  Wills said the money helped renovate the school library and yard, purchase smartboards, launch an online distance-learning program that links to district schools, and open a dance studio.  “There is no electioneering going on,” Wills said, adding that he gives such display checks to other schools he funds. Some principals “choose to post them in their main offices,” he added.  “He came to visit the principal every day” for months, she said.  Principal White recently came under fire for hanging a mural depicting herself as a Hindu goddess. She is also named in several lawsuits by employees alleging harassment and discrimination, including one in which Assistant Principal David Possner said White called him “a bad Jew” because he answered a text from the school on Yom Kippur.  “It seems this principal thinks she’s bulletproof,” said Possner’s lawyer, Jonathan Tand.  The DOE released a statement by Principal White saying: “We posted these checks to celebrate the educational programs supported by these funds and not to make any political statement.”",

        "article": "BAGHDAD – Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged the Iraqi government on Friday to \"show restraint\" after security forces stormed an Iranian opposition refugee camp that had long existed under the protection of the U.S. and its coalition partners.  \"We have been monitoring the situation at Camp Ashraf in Diyala,\" said Gates after a visit with American troops in Iraq. \"We are very concerned with reports of deaths, of injuries resulting from this morning's clash between Iraqi Security Forces and the MEK. I urge the Iraqi government to show restraint and live up to their commitments to treat the residents of Ashraf in accordance with Iraqi law and their international obligations.\"  Gates said no American troops were involved in the attacks, but that medical assistance was offered.  The exiled MEK -- also known as the People's Mujahedeen of Iran -- was given refuge in Iraq more than 20 years ago by the Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein, and has long been a thorn in the side of the Shiite dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The U.S. took responsibility for the camp's security in 2003, but handed over control to the Iraqis in 2009. Iran, a close Shiite ally of Baghdad, has also been pressing for the expulsion of the group, which seeks the overthrow of Tehran's clerical rulers.  The group has had a checkered history with the U.S. -- it backed the 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran -- and while it still is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, it has not been linked to any terrorist activity since it renounced violence in 2001.  Camp resident Shahriar Kia claimed that at least 28 residents were killed -- including six women -- and more than 300 injured in the alleged attack. Those casualty figures could not be confirmed since access to the camp is controlled by Iraqi security forces.  \"This is a massacre, a catastrophe,\" said Behzad Saffari, who has lived at Ashraf for nine years and acts as the camp's legal adviser, the Associated Press reported. \"They came inside the camp and attacked people with grenades and tear gas, and then they started to shoot people. When people saw the attack was about to begin, they lined up to defend their homes.\"  Top Iraqi government officials vehemently denied any fatalities.  \"One hundred members of the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran attacked our security and military forces,\" Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told the Associated Press. \"Our forces did not use weapons. The situation is calm now.\"  But a hospital official in Baqouba, Diyala's capital, reported three people were killed and 13 wounded in the pre-dawn offensive. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information, said five Iraqi soldiers also were injured.  In a statement Thursday, the U.S. Committee for Camp Ashraf Residents, urged the Obama Administration Thursday to intervene and prevent attacks on the Iranian refugees.  The leader of the Paris-based group, Mariam Rajavi, reportedly sent a letter to President Obama on Friday morning claiming that six of the dead were women and that they were either shot or crushed under vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported.  In the letter, Rajavi insisted that the U.S. remains responsible for the safety of the 3,400 people in the camp, based on agreements established after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Journal reported.  \"I appeal to you to act upon the U.S. government's commitments and responsibilities and prevent the continuation of war crimes,\" Rajavi reportedly wrote.  In an interview Friday, Iraqi Lt. Gen. Ali Ghaidan said he ordered the incursion to curb two days of exiles hurling stones at troops and throwing themselves in front of soldiers' trucks. He said the uprising began after Iraqi troops starting out units that are stationed nearby.  Camp residents painted a far more dire picture of the scene, and supplied video purportedly taken early Friday that showed gunfire and military bulldozers approaching the camp, and Humvees flying the Iraqi flag chasing down nearly some 100 stone-throwing masked people in an open area, the Associated Press reported. At least one resident is seen hit by a Humvee.  The video also shows at least six people lying on a the ground, and a dozen of blood-soaked men being treated by doctors.

It points the way to the kind of compact housing our cities need, but which so many of our architects and house-builders find difficult to achieve.  The apartment block, One Centaur Street, rises four storeys from what had seemed a very unpromising site, a narrow strip of land that had been a scrapyard for many years. The prince of Centaur Street is Roger Zogolovitch, architect, developer and course director of the London School of Economics' cities programme. Zogolovitch has put his own money into this building and, although it is a commercial concern, he is unlikely to reap much profit. This, however, is not the point: One Centaur Place is a prototype for intelligent and elegant city housing that could happily be repeated, and profitably so.  \"If the planners had agreed,\" says Alex de Rijke,\"we could have continued the design up to as many as 20 storeys. Of course, this was impossible in this particular location, but the idea of the building is that it can be recreated in any number of patterns: higher, lower, using different colours and finishes and with different internal layouts.  \"The cost of this kind of block would fall if we were able to build several at once but, in any case, we have made as much use as possible of prefabricated and off-the-shelf components to keep costs down. This is also an aesthetic we like.\"  A solid concrete block is clad in a form of contemporary clapboard. What might be taken for old railway sleepers bolted along the walls turn out to be dark, concrete sections animating all four sides of the building. Set close together at its base, they grow wider apart as the building pops its head above the railway viaduct, causing the block to lighten as it rises into the London sky.  This clever, yet restrained, use of materials continues throughout the building. De Rijke and his partners, Philip Marsh and Sadie Morgan, have created their own vocabulary of materials, playing intelligently with unusual woods and tiles offset by finely finished concrete, glass and industrial components.  The great thing about this residential building is that it is a hybrid, fusing, as de Rijke points out, \"the European horizontal apartment and the English vertical terraced house\". In practice, this means that each of the light and thoughtfully planned flats is arranged on several levels connected by a contemporary take on the traditional, narrow London staircase. The effect is of living in a small, sunlit house inside an apartment block. The block, seen as a single entity from the outside, is rather like a Rubik cube inside.  There is nothing tricky or quaint here: the building is an unpretentious architectural ship berthed in a tight London dock. It boasts balconies on all floors: recessed on its sunny south side, projecting on to the street on its north side.  Its top deck (roof terraces for the penthouse flats) is contained by Key-Klamp railings, the sort you expect to find guarding zebra crossings outside school gates. These penthouses would be ideal city pads for railway buffs: the view here is like looking down on a train set, with the backdrop of the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye.  Below, residents will share a garden made of concrete and old timber railway sleepers, adorned with magnolia trees and lined with honeysuckle, willowherb (a railway plant), busy Lizzie and London pride. The architects are so pleased with the building that they have bought the ground floor to use as their office. The other flats are for sale.  It is curious that buildings like this are so rare. We have all but forgotten how to build compact city housing so intelligently. The 18th-century terrace that paces along the side of One Centaur Street is a perfect (and perfectly average) example of the type of handsomely proportioned, plain English housing that developers used to run up in their tens of thousands. Whatever street they occupy, they always look good. Cheap to build, easy to repair, flexible in use, they have stood the test of time and continue to define the look of so much of London and other cities. A grim 1970s (possibly 1980s) housing block jostling for attention elsewhere in this mix is an example of where we have gone wrong. With its tiny windows, childish play of materials, tiny pitched roofs and general toytown aesthetic, it is far better suited to a cul-de-sac an hour down the line from Waterloo than a street where Blake once walked and some of the greatest poetry in the English language was written.  We seem to have no problem with converting old buildings into modern flats, but find the design of the modern equivalent of old London terraced housing difficult. Who is to blame? Planners? Architects? House builders? House buyers? Possibly a poorly informed alliance of all four. It is difficult for house buyers to make proper choices or get their voices heard in the city housing market. It is only when there are examples to look at, such as One Centaur Street, that any of us can see what a desirable yet low-cost modern city home might be like. London is a city built largely by developers, although much of its finest, cheaper homes were designed and paid for by public bodies like the munificent old London County Council (1889-1965).  What our cities need is developers with the intelligent concern and willingness to take risks of Roger Zogolovitch, the talents of architects like dRMM and local authority officers keen to create a new generation of popular housing free of sentimentality, kitsch detailing and wilfully anti-urban design. Standing alongside one of the busiest main line railways in Europe, One Centaur Place might not be everyone's choice, but as a pointer to the standard of city housing we can easily have if we want it, it is all but peerless.  · For more information, call 020-7399 8600.",

But, sure enough, it was Wintour.  She felt brave enough to dispense with her signature runway safety goggles. But she took care to surround herself with a posse that included boyfriend Shelby Bryan and daughter Bee Schaffer.  Word is Meryl Streep, who plays editor Miranda Priestly, had persuaded Wintour to come by, assuring her that her character was an amalgam of other fashion arbiters - ladies like Diana Vreeland, Polly Mellon, Grace Mirabella and Liz Tilberis. Plus, Streep had been nice enough to strip Priestly of her Wintourish British accent.  It was fine to see Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott, Martha Stewart and Candice Bergen. But what if she got caught in an elevator with Lauren Weisberger, the former Vogue assistant who turned her stint at the mag into a best seller. Ever since the book's publication in 2003, Wintour had refused to dignify it with a comment.  What if Wintour ran into the willowy Weisberger? Organizers were determined not to let it happen.  \"They purposely seated Lauren and Anna on opposite sides of the theater,\" says one source. \"As far away as humanly possible.\"  Disappointingly, the plan worked. Wintour escaped the theater without a confrontation with the young woman who'd gotten rich off her.  \"I heard she was there,\" Weisberger told us. \"I haven't run into her since the book came out. We travel in different circles. All I know is that it was one of the most exciting nights of my life.\"  And how did Wintour like the film?  \"She thought it was very entertaining,\" said her spokesman. \"It was satire. What's not to like?\"  RAPPER THE GAME was busted Saturday night after police in Burbank found a deadly weapon - specifically, brass knuckles - in his Bentley. The former gangbanger (l.), real name Jayceon Taylor, was pulled over because no license plates were displayed, reports allhiphop.com. Mr. Game was released on $20,000 bail. ... CATE BLANCHETT will play Bob Dylan in his \"androgynous phase\" in a new biopic of the musical mystic, who turned 65 yesterday. Heath Ledger, Richard Gere, Christian Bale and Ben Wishaw are among the seven actors who'll portray Dylan in \"I'm Not There,\" written by Oren Moverman and Todd Haynes, who'll direct. ... FORMER DYLAN lover Joan Baez warbled \"We Shall Overcome\" from atop  a tree in L.A. yesterday. Baez has joined logging foe Julia (Butterfly) Hill in her perch as part of an effort to save a community garden. ... IF GEN. MICHAEL Hayden doesn't work out as the new CIA chief, President Bush could always tap Ron Silver. The actor applied to the agency when he was 22, right out of the State University at Buffalo. \"The CIA accepted me,\" Silver told Webster Hall's Baird Jones at Le Cirque. \"But I got distracted. I fell in love with my college sweetheart.\" ... MATT DILLON better stick to limos. The \"Crash\" cop was once riding the C train to SoHo when a guy with a knife ran onto the train. \"One cop thought it was me and pulled his gun on me, but then they spotted the guy - it was the guy who was sitting across from me!\" Dillon says in Gotham magazine.  SOFIA COPPOLA's \"Marie Antoinette\" was roundly booed at the Cannes film fest yesterday. French critics sneered that the long-awaited film from the \"Lost in Translation\" director lacked depth and should be titled \"Barbie Antoinette.\" The Oscar-winner (left) admitted being disappointed, but argued that the catcalls were better than \"a mediocre response.\" That's probably what Marie said on her way to the guillotine ...  ANDERSON COOPER used his Yale commencement speech to bolster his studliness. \"The only thing about high school I remember is my senior prom,\" the CNN anchor said. \"If what I remember is true, it is very possible that some of you are my children, especially you with the blue eyes and freakishly gray hair\" ...

Ladies who want to know Carmen's secrets can look forward to her new Broadway book, \"How to Be Sexy,\" just sold by Literary Group agent Frank Weimann ...

The 45-year-old's revelation has sparked debate around his claim to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious figure who launched bitcoin in 2009.  The Brisbane-born tech entrepreneur told the BBC, The Economist and GQ on Monday he was Mr Nakamoto and provided proof of coin transactions and a digital signature which he said was held only by the bitcoin founder.  Bitcoin Foundation director Gavin Andresen, who took over the project when Mr Nakamoto disappeared in 2011, vouched for the authenticity of Mr Wright's claim.  Bitcoin Association of Australia board member and software engineer Lucas Cullen said Mr Wright hadn't produced adequate evidence it was the digital signature Mr Nakamoto used in the early years of bitcoin.  He said someone involved in cryptography should be able to offer more definitive proof.  \"I think it is a bit of an oxymoron there to say `here's my claim, but I can't validate it' - especially when you're in that space,\" Mr Cullen told AAP.  American computer security researcher Dan Kaminsky also dismissed Mr Wright's proof as a hoax in a detailed blog post.  \"Yes, this is a scam. Not maybe. Not possibly,\" Mr Kaminsky posted.  Tech sleuths have also debunked Mr Wright's claim in multiple Reddit threads outlining technical explanations of how Mr Wright made others believe he was Bitcoin's creator.  Mr Wright, however, told the BBC he didn't care if anyone believed him.  \"I was the main part of it, other people helped me. Some people will believe, some people won't, and to tell you the truth, I don't really care.\"  Mr Wright was first connected to Mr Nakamoto in reports by technology publications Gizmodo and Wired last year.  Following the reports, Australian Federal Police raided his home on Sydney's north shore as part of an unrelated tax investigation, police said.  A former next door neighbour told AAP on Tuesday that Mr Wright, his wife and two children had moved out of the house before the raid in December and said he believed the family had since relocated to London.  The reclusive family was normal and did nothing to indicate Mr Wright was the mastermind behind Bitcoin, he said.  Mr Wright was formerly the head of alternative currency firm DeMorgan Ltd and worked as an adjunct academic at Charles Sturt University between 2011-2014.",

So the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings. Its entrance on the scene, in France, on 17 June 1939, had a similarly immediate and unequivocal effect.  That morning, the public guillotining of German serial killer Eugen Weidmann, outside the Saint-Pierre prison in Versailles, was filmed by a spectator -- unbeknownst to the authorities. You can see the footage online today. Photographers also recorded the action, and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after Weidmann's death.  As if the rowdy crowds on the day were not bad enough, now the action could be viewed again and again by untold thousands of voyeurs.  After that, the guillotine was rolled away behind prison walls -- not because decapitations were too horrifying to watch, but because people will watch them no matter how horrifying they are.  Why no masks in ISIS beheading video? 02:33  For centuries, public executions had been intended to terrify by example, when for many they were little more than light entertainment. The advent of film proved this beyond doubt.If the history of beheadings tells us anything, it is that there will always be people who want to see. Today the Internet offers us front-row seats, on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch. Murders can be \"nothing to do with us\" even as we click on the screen to play the film.  In the 21st century, spectators experience a sense of detachment from the event -- which has already happened at some point in the past and in \"another world\" supposedly far removed from our own -- alongside an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Now we can watch close-up, but in private, in our own time and space.  The recent ISIS beheadings were experienced by many viewers like a gruesome serial drama, and the murderers know we will tune in for the next episode. Even those who do not watch the ISIS \"show\" can hardly avoid the media analysis that accompanies each instalment.  Producing these films requires relatively little organization, money or complicated technology. Compared to other terrorist offenses, it is low-tech and high-impact. The action can be carefully choreographed while retaining its ruthless authenticity, and the results are sensational.  The camera has become a new stage for public beheadings, a new spike for displaying a trophy head.  When pathological criminals behead innocent civilians, the murderers address their audience and present their spoils, drawing those who watch into their narrative. The entire spectacle denotes the powerlessness of the victim, and, by extension, the powerlessness of their countrymen to intervene.  Spectators who watch beheadings online impotently fulfil the perpetrators' desire to be seen. The ISIS murderers have relied on sophisticated manipulation of social media sites to ensure that their footage appears on our screens before we even know what we are watching.  At the same time, a person's reaction can reverberate through the cyber-crowd instantaneously, creating the kind of group mentality that mirrors the dynamics of a real crowd.  When the footage of James Foley's murder circulated via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in August 2014, a Syrian activist named Hend Amry asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag #ISISmediablackout. \"Pour water on their flame,\" she tweeted.  The movement to boycott the film gathered momentum in the hours that followed, and Twitter responded by removing tweets that embedded the video or screenshots of it. For the first time since the death of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2004, the silent majority found a voice, and more and more members of the crowd refused to watch.  A group of militants had tried to make an impact, in an appalling way, and their efforts were beginning, just beginning, to fail.  When the victim of a beheading is bound and defenceless, he or she becomes a pawn in somebody else's production. The power no longer derives from the act of decapitation itself, which may require a pathological perpetrator, but it does not require the luck and skill to win a fight. Instead, the power emerges from the reception the slayer receives as he plays his part on the stage. There is no triumph in the killer's actions until we watch.  Modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs, but it can also give a voice to human decency. No good can ever come from murder, but if public opinion is able to neutralize the killers' triumph by refusing to broadcast the graphic imagery they want us to see, then this is a step forward.

The mayor was talking about citizens who volunteered to send in $1.3 million for the purpose of throwing a really big party to celebrate, well, the mayor. Some of the most generous corporate citizens were familiar names, like Liberty Mutual, Comcast Corp., Related Beal, Bank of America, and Boston University — just to name five.  Perhaps the mayor really didn’t knowthe names of big donors who helped fund his inauguration, as well as a transition process that occurred before he took office. But rest assured, those leading donors were not confused about why they had their checkbooks out.  The inauguration gala contribution is as close at it gets to a sure thing for companies that do business with government and donate money to politicians. It’s like betting on a horse after the race has been run.  A huge party bankrolled by organizations that have a lot riding on good relations with City Hall is one thing. Private funding for the mayor’s transition process — though it totaled $133,600, a relatively small amount of money — was in some ways just as troubling. That process involved a series of meetings organized to plan the way city government would be run once Walsh took power.  To be fair to the mayor, he did not invent the concept of the big-ticket, privately funded inauguration blowout and related expenses. Many other politicians have already blazed this dubious trail.  Governor Deval Patrick set the statewide standard seven years ago when he raised $1.9 million for an inaugural ball at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center, an outdoor swearing-in on the State House steps, and other celebrations across the state. Patrick scaled back plans for his reelection celebration and raised a more modest $700,000 the second time around.  Privately funded inauguration events were conceived long ago as a kind of responsible-government fiction — built on the notion that billing taxpayers for elaborate celebrations of elected officials would be wrong. But they created yet another opportunity for big money to influence public policy. There’s nothing responsible about that.  Martha Coakley, the attorney general and gubernatorial candidate, struck a very big deal Monday with her longtime investigative target, the medical giant Partners HealthCare. She effectively made peace after years of criticism for the organization that oversees hospitals, including Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s in Boston.  Coakley complained relentlessly about the marketing clout Partners wielded and the expensive impact the chain had on medical costs in Massachusetts. Along with the US Justice Department, she mulled antitrust charges to block a Partners plan to take over South Shore Hospital in Weymouth.  Now she’s settling with Partners, permitting an important merger in return for a series of significant economic concessions that will remain in effect for as long as a decade.  I don’t know what would have happenedif Coakley had gone to court to block that deal. Antitrust cases have mixed track records and can drag on forever. An eventual settlement may have been no better than the deal signed Monday.  Here’s one thing I do know: A settlement is a far better thing to carry around over the next five months of campaigning.  The deal is a tangible accomplishment, and it makes peace with a lot of influential people. Who knows, they may even turn out to be useful campaign supporters from the medical world.  Then Steward Health Care’s Ralph de la Torre will have some real company.",

However, Russia has been busy cracking down on internet and media freedoms in general since Snowden’s arrival, banning majority foreign ownership for mass media, and drafting new laws to make sure that restrictions on promoting ‘extremism’ also apply to bloggers as well as news sites and publications. Like many other countries, Russia’s also bringing a new law to force companies to store personal data on its own citizens locally. That law is due to come into force in September.  Snowden’s op-ed comes in a week that has seen key provisions of the Patriot Act, which form the legal foundation for much of the NSA’s monitoring of suspected terrorist activity, lapse after a filibuster by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul stopped them being extended.  “After a White House-appointed oversight board investigation found that this program had not stopped a single terrorist attack, even the president who once defended its propriety and criticized its disclosure has now ordered it terminated,” Snowden wrote. “This is the power of an informed public.”  Snowden also sided, if only implicitly, with Apple Inc. AAPL Tim Cook over the development and spread of encryption tools to stop government snooping.  “Some of the world’s most popular online services have been enlisted as partners in the NSA’s mass surveillance programs, and technology companies are being pressured by governments around the world to work against their customers rather than for them,” he argued.  Snowden warned, however, that countries are still using terrorist attacks justify invasive new powers for their security services. He singled out Canada, France and Australia, and also criticised U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s declared intention to expand surveillance powers.  He made no mention of the three terrorist attacks in those countries in the last six months that claimed 15 lives. Nor did he mention the increasing body of evidence showing how organizations like Islamic State have used encrypted messaging services for the purpose of recruiting jihadis. European countries in particular are worried by the prospect of their citizens learning terror techniques in warzones such as Syria and Iraq and then returning to use them at home.",

        "article": "An AI robot in Shanghai. (AAP)  With technology developing at a rapid rate, a Google-owned, London-based artificial intelligence research laboratory has developed a “big red button” to stop robots from getting too far ahead of human control.  Robots take orders at a cafe in Shanghai, are closer to performing surgery and artificial intelligence (AI) means bots can just about think for themselves, so a recent research paper aims to make sure they can be turned off effectively.  DeepMind, a lab bought by Google in 2014, worked with scientists from the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute to develop “a big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions.”  The paper claims researchers have created a way to repeatedly interrupt an AI, while making sure it “will not learn to prevent (or seek!) being interrupted by the environment or a human operator” on its own.  In a study that is reminiscent of The Matrix – where man must take on machines running the world – the ablility to “safely interrupt” was deemed necessary for robots that are “misbehaving”.  \"Safe interruptibility can be useful to take control of a robot that is misbehaving and may lead to irreversible consequences, or to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to temporarily use it to achieve a task it did not learn to perform or would not necessarily receive rewards for this,\" the researchers wrote.  It is not the first warning issued on advances in robot technology – Tesla mastermind Elon Musk, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates have all urged caution.  Mr Musk notably called the prospect of artificial intelligence “our greatest existential threat” in a 2014 interview with MIT students.  He also recently called for a need for humans to enhance their brain power with digital technology.  “Under any rate of advancement in AI we will be left behind by a lot,” he told the Telegraph on Thursday.  Mr Hawking warned in October last year that AI could threaten humanity’s existence.  “A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble,” he said at the time.",

        "article": "Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun becomes first Major League player to win an appeal of positive drug test.  Ryan Braun, the National League MVP who staunchly denied having used performance-enhancing drugs and enlisted a heavy-hitting legal and public relations team to help him prove it, on Thursday became the first Major League Baseball player to win an appeal of a positive drug test and avoid a suspension. Braun, who tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone in October just as the Milwaukee Brewers were making a pennant run, challenged the validity of the test on chain-of-custody issues — for two days, the test sat in the home of the collector — and avoided a 50-game suspension that would have begun on Opening Day. Independent arbitrator Shyam Das cast the deciding vote on the three-person appeals panel that included MLB vice president for labor relations Rob Manfred and MLB players union chief executive officer Michael Weiner. RYAN BRAUN TESTS POSITIVE FOR PEDs, CALLS RESULT 'BS' (ARCHIVE) Baseball reacted quickly to the decision, basically saying Braun got off on a technicality and issuing a terse statement that said it “vehemently disagrees with the decision rendered today by arbitrator Shyam Das.” The statement continued: “Major League Baseball considers the obligations of the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program essential to the integrity of our game, our clubs and all of the players who take the field,” Manfred said. “It has always been Major League Baseball’s position that no matter who tests positive, we will exhaust all avenues in pursuit of the appropriate discipline. We have been true to that position in every instance, because baseball fans deserve nothing less.” Braun quickly issued his own statement, saying he was “very pleased and relieved by today’s decision. It is the first step in restoring my good name and reputation. We were able to get through this because I am innocent and the truth is on our side.” \"We provided complete cooperation throughout, despite the highly unusual circumstances,\" the NL MVP's statement said. \"I have been an open book, willing to share details from every aspect of my life as part of this investigation, because I have nothing to hide. I have passed over 25 drug tests in my career, including at least three in the past year. As I said before, I’ve always loved and had so much respect for the game of baseball. Everything I’ve done in my career has been with that respect and appreciation in mind. I look forward to finally being able to speak to the fans and the media on Friday and then returning the focus to baseball.\" Braun’s defense centered around his claim that the test administered to him in the Brewers’ clubhouse on Saturday, Oct. 1 was compromised once it left the premises, including that after the urine sample was collected by representatives of Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (CDT), it sat in the home of one of the collectors for two days before being shipped by FedEx to the World Anti-Doping Laboratory in Montreal for analysis. Believing FedEx would be closed late on a Saturday afternoon, a source familiar with the testing process said, the collector followed CDT’s standing instructions and brought the sample to his house — better to have it in a cool place rather than sitting in a FedEx warehouse. “It was triple-sealed and inspected appropriate for testing when it arrived at the Montreal lab,” said the source. “It was in a vial with a tamper-proof seal, then put in a plastic bag with a tamper-proof seal, then in a tamper-proof box. There was no evidence it was tampered with.” Braun himself did not argue that the test was tampered with. Major League Baseball’s drug policy says samples should be shipped on the same day they are collected “absent unusual circumstance,” but instructs collectors to keep the chain of custody intact and keep the samples in a cool, secure location if the specimen is not immediately shipped. The sample was not brought to FedEx until that Monday afternoon, a delay on which the arbitrator apparently based his decision. In a two-day hearing on Jan. 19 and 20, Braun and his legal team raised the chain-of-custody issues and pointed out that the 28-year-old left fielder had never failed a test before, and that he easily passed another test not administered by MLB shortly after he was told of his positive test. Braun’s positive test (his testosterone to epitestosterone ratio was 20:1; the trigger point for a positive is 4:1) was described to the Daily News in December by a source familiar with his case as reflecting “insanely high” levels of testosterone. “(It was) the highest ever for anyone who has ever taken a test, twice the level of the highest test ever taken,” said the source, and was used as evidence that Braun would not have knowingly taken such a large dose of a substance that would trigger such a high positive. “It was more than just (the CDT representative) not giving it to FedEx promptly,” said a source familiar with the case. “Isn’t it odd that of 40,000 tests, the one that goes missing for two days has a higher ratio than any test ever?”  According to the source, there were also noticeable differences in Braun’s test and samples from two other players held by the same collector. “The pH level changed,” said the source, “from the original recording to the time it reached the lab. The sample deteriorated.” The director of the Montreal lab, Christiane Ayotte, however, testified during the hearing that it was not unusual for the pH balance to change from the original reading, which is conducted, as one source said, at the collection site with something resembling a dip stick, and that the equipment used in the field is not as accurate as the equipment in the lab.  Braun’s decision to challenge the result was considered futile by many: In 13 previous appeals for positive tests, baseball had a perfect record. Yet Braun and his team insisted that the player had never exhibited signs of steroid or PED use, that his numbers had not drastically changed and that he had not suffered injuries that might cause him to turn to steroids, as players such as Andy Pettitte have claimed. Braun went straight up against the tough standard for winning an appeal; according to MLB’s collectively bargained agreement with the players, “a player cannot satisfy his burden by merely denying that he intentionally used a prohibited substance; the player must provide objective evidence in support of his denial.” The league does not have to show “intent, fault, negligence or knowing use of a Prohibited Substance on the Player’s part to establish such a violation.”  According to sources, baseball has already begun discussing adjustments in its collection process with the union but it is not expected to challenge the arbitrator’s ruling and believes its drug program is solid. “It’s a technical problem that can be fixed,” said one source. One player who was tested in the offseason described the collection process to The News this way: “The chaperone comes to your house (or to the clubhouse), and he physically watches you urinate into a plastic cup. There is a number on the cup, which corresponds to a number on a box. You sign a paper to verify that those numbers match, and then you watch him seal the box. That is the only access you have physically or visually to your sample. He leaves with your sample in the sealed box. “I think it is a stretch to think that someone is going to take your sample and alter it, “ added the player, “but I suppose it is possible.”",

        "article": "SWARMS of fake Buddhist monks have overtaken the capital’s tourist hotspots – forcing visitors to part with cash in exchange for tacky souvenirs and to raise “donations” for “peace”.  The shaved headed monks, wearing different shades of brown and orange robes with trainers are harassing tourists and pressuring them to pay up for golden tokens – made from cheap plastic.  On Monday afternoon four monks panhandled tourists for money between Tower Bridge and Southwark Bridge, thrusting the golden cards into hands before insisting they pay up.  American Aaron Wagle, 18, is on holiday from Kansas and was sightseeing near City Hall when a monk approached.  He was asked to fill in a form and write down the amount he would be donating – but the monk never explained what the money would go towards.  Aaron said: “He didn’t really say much. He said he wanted to talk about peace and said he would pray for me.  “He told me to write down my name and ‘London’ on a clipboard he had.  “He then asked me to write down how much money I was going to give him.  “I gave £1 but then he got annoyed and demanded more so I gave him a load of change.  “I don’t think I gave him more than about £1.50.  “He said it was a donation for something, but he wouldn’t say what.”  Working in teams, the monks take shifts and panhandle for a short amount of time before disappearing until another takes over.  Suspiciously, one monk left Tower Bridge and met with another beneath London Bridge, where they spoke quietly.  Another family were queuing for dinner by Tower Bridge when they were approached by the same monk demanding £10.  Jan, a dad of four, holidaying in Britain said: “He asked me for £10 and I said no, but I still paid £5.  “We’re here on holiday for two weeks, it seemed quite aggressive.  “I felt quite pressured but I still wanted to help him and I said ‘good luck.'”  The monk, who was with two others approaching tourists targeted Dutch couple Janou, 24, and Suen, 27.  The holidaying couple were shocked to have the monk approach them and were disgusted when a golden token was thrust into Janou’s hand.  She said: “He asked me for £10 and the even asked me to make a monthly donation to their cause.  “We said no and he had given us this thing and he wanted us to fill out this form with our names.  “Because we’d said no he just walked off disappointed.  “But he never said exactly what he was raising money for.”  A spokesman for the Buddhist Society said people can tell the real from the fake – because “genuine Buddhist monks would never ask for money”.  He said the society had received calls in recent days from concerned members of the public about what’s going on in London.  He told The Sun: “We had a call from a concerned member of the public about this just yesterday and we have heard of it before.  “People feel it is demeaning to the image of Buddhism.  “One of the things many people don’t know is that Buddhist monks can’t handle money.  “Traditionally though monks are beggars. In places like Thailand they beg and are given gifts of food such as rice which they are allowed to eat but not take money. They wouldn’t be able to touch it.”  Shockingly this isn’t the first time the “fake monks” have been spotted aggressively asking people to part with their cash.  Only two months ago Buddhist leaders in New York issued a warning to tourists telling them to beware the growing number of fraudulent “monks” on the city’s streets.  Men in orange robes claiming to be Buddhist monks have been approaching visitors at some of the city’s most popular attractions – including the High Line elevated park.  According to CBS New York, back in June the con artists were handing tourists shiny medallions and offering greetings of people claiming the donations would help them build a temple in Thailand.  However the became aggressive when their demands were refused.  Rev. TK Nakagaki, president of the Buddhist Council of New York, told the broadcaster: “The problem seems to be increasing. They are very aggressive and hostile if you don’t give them money.  Michelle Dunson of the Buddhist Council of New York added: “They’re not authentic. They’re not real. They’re playing on people’s heart strings.  “It’s basically a scam like any other.”  As well as in New York, the “monks” have also been spotted in other countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China, and now they’re roaming the streets of London.  Shaved men dressed in monk-style robes are patrolling the Tower of London approaching tourists, families and lone women asking for handouts and a gesture of “peace”.  A small group of Asian men wearing orange and brown robes over a t-shirt, jeans and trainers, can be seen walking the mile-long footpath around the home of the Crown Jewels.  Unsuspecting tourists are targeted, approached, shown a tacky, plastic relic and braided wooden bracelet and asked to fill in four columns in a small pocked-sized notebook.  The first three columns are labelled, “name”, “location” and “request have” – the vast majority of respondents had written “peace” in the latter.  In the final column, “money”, respondents had written amounts ranging from 50p to £20, with those who gave little scorned by the monks and encouraged to give more.  When the men, all aged between 30 and 60, finished a lap of the Tower, they stopped for a cigarette or a spot of lunch, which consisted of nothing more than a dry, unfilled bread roll and one-pint bottle of semi-skimmed milk.  As they spotted a press photographer taking snaps of them in the park, they pulled out a mobile phone and made a call.  Two Dutch students on holiday in the UK, Ruben Sjoerd, 21, and Sasha Bos, 23, were cornered by one of the monk-like men as they approached Tower Bridge.  Ruben said: “They gave us a little card with Buddha on it and a little gold thing, not real gold, and a wooden bracelet-type thing.  “There were boxes on the card to fill in. He said he would write our donations in the temple.  Pretty sure I got shafted for a fiver by one of those fake bhuddist monks in London. My path to being an idiot tourist is now complete.  — Magnus Joss (@Jax_Moss) January 24, 2016  “He wanted our name, address and how much we were going to give him. We asked him why he wanted us to donate but he couldn’t really speak English.  “Even if we had change we wouldn’t have given him some money. We are not fools.  “But we didn’t have any cash or change, so we told him we couldn’t. Then he just disappeared.”  Sasha said: “It was so weird. We were like, ‘why would a monk being asking for money?’.”  Jane Squire, a city worker in her 50s from Clapham, south London, said: “First of all he looked straight down at my bag, and I thought, ‘what is he doing?’  “But then he gave me this gold-coloured thing to hold. It was glittery. It looked like it had a star on it or something.  In general, monks associated with real temples do not go around soliciting money on the streets – and there aren’t that many in the capital. Real monks do not act aggressively, and would gladly offer a blessing without asking for money, and would certainly not demand a higher amount of money than the one offered. Authentic monks typically would not acknowledge a donation, and would avoid eye contact. They would not sell beads, medallions, amulets, or rosaries. Monks associated with real temples should be able to answer questions about which temple they belong to, and wouldn’t walk away or refuse to answer questions. A genuine monk should be able to answer questions about Buddhism.  “He told me that it was from his temple. Then he starts to bring out a book for me to sign and he said he would write what I wrote in his temple.  “There were a few columns, name and something else.  “But the last column was for money. He said, ‘now you pay’.  “I said, ‘now I don’t’ and just walked off. It was a bit scary at first because he looked straight at my bag. I didn’t know what he wanted.”  Another woman, Elma Sanli from south-east London, was on the phone smoking a cigarette by Tower Bridge when she was approached by a robed “monk”.  She said: “He just came up to me and went, ‘you’re smoking too much’.  “I just said ‘yeah, thanks’ and carried on. It was a bit bizarre.  “I’ve seen them walking up here a lot. A lot of people do give them money, especially the tourists.”  In New York panhandling on the city streets isn’t illegal – as long as the person isn’t acting aggressively.  However the city’s parks department says it is unlawful to solicit cash without a permit.  Cops claim that on the rare occasions they have been called the men have usually disappeared by the time they have arrived.  We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

        "article": "Indonesian officials said Saturday that they were confident wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 had been located after sonar equipment detected four massive objects on the ocean floor.  The biggest piece, measuring 18 metres long and 5.4 metres wide, appeared to be part of the jet's body, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency.  Though strong currents and big surf have prevented divers from entering waters to get a visual of the suspected fuselage, officials are hopeful they will find many of the 162 passengers and crew still strapped in their seats inside.  So far, after nearly a week of searching, only 30 bodies have been found floating in the choppy waters.  The Airbus A320 crashed Dec. 28, halfway into a two-hour flight from Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, to Singapore. Minutes before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control that he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic.  While the plane's black boxes — the flight data and cockpit voice recorders — have yet to be located, the discovery of the wreckage, especially if it is largely intact, would greatly benefit the investigation.  The objects were discovered Friday and Saturday and a Geological Survey vessel was used to assess dimensions, Soelistyo said.  In addition to what appeared to be a significant part of the plane's body, chunks of debris found in the target search area measured up to 12 metres long.  Other suspected plane parts were seen scattered on beaches during an aerial survey, Soelistyo said.  Indonesian authorities announced the grounding of AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, with the Transport Ministry saying the airline did not have a permit to fly on Sundays. However, Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority said Saturday that from its end, the airline had been approved to fly the route daily.  AirAsia, which began operations in 2001, quickly becoming one of the region's most popular low-cost carriers, said it was reviewing the suspension. The crash was the airline's first.  Strong currents and towering waves, sometimes four metres high, have slowed recovery efforts, scattering bodies and debris in all directions. The discoveries so far include an emergency exit door and slide, as well as a backpack with food and a camera.  It remains unclear what caused the plane to plunge into the Java Sea, though bad weather appears to have been a factor, according to a 14-page report released by Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency.  \"Flight 8501 appears to have been trapped in bad weather that would have been difficult to avoid,\" the report said.  As part of the investigation into the crash, autopsies will be carried out on some of the bodies, including the pilot and co-pilot, whose remains have not yet been recovered, said Budiyono, who heads East Java's Disaster Victim Identification unit and, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.  Generally, aviation experts say the more passengers, luggage and parts of the aircraft that remain intact, the more likely the plane hit the water in one piece. That would signal problems like a mechanical error or a stall instead of a mid-air breakup due to an explosion or sudden depressurization.  For family members, the wait has been agonizing, with local media covering every development and theory, many of which have proved to be untrue — including a false report that a body was found wearing a life jacket, which would have indicated passengers had time to prepare for the impact or miraculously were able to put them on after hitting the water.  With more corpses arriving in Surabaya, some relatives said they were simply worn out. But they were encouraged by reports that parts of the plane had been detected and hoped that everyone on board would be retrieved.  \"Let's hope the news is true,\" said Ongko Gunawan, whose sister was on the flight with her husband and their child. \"We need to move on.\"  Indonesian navy ship KRI Yos Sudarso takes part in the search operation for missing AirAsia Flight QZ8501 earlier this week. (Andika Wahyu/Antara Foto/Reuters)  Vessels involved in the search for debris included at least eight sophisticated navy ships from Singapore, Russia, Malaysia and the U.S. equipped with sonars for scouring the seabed to pinpoint the all-important black boxes and the wreckage.  A second U.S. Navy ship arrived Saturday to help in the search.  The hope, officials say, is that the body of the plane will still be largely intact, speeding the investigation.  \"Many of the passengers believed to be still trapped inside the plane's fuselage and could be discovered soon,\" Supriyadi said. \"God willing, we will complete this operation next week.\"",

Next, the slugger might face his teammates in the next few days.  McCourt said Ramirez called him and the two met Saturday, two days after the 12-time All-Star began serving a penalty imposed by Major League Baseball.  \"I wanted to meet him face to face,\" McCourt said. \"He started off the meeting by apologizing and acknowledging the disappointment that he's created - not only for me but for others.  \"He's in the process right now of doing what anybody else would do if they made a mistake, in terms of making amends here and communicating with the people he knows he has to communicate with and then going about repairing his relationships. And of course, his is magnified many times because he's a public figure and a very popular one.\"  McCourt also said he thinks Ramirez should speak to his teammates about the suspension.  \"If Manny takes the steps that I'm hopeful he will, I think this will be something that won't damage this franchise at all,\" McCourt said. \"We all make mistakes, and it's how we deal with those mistakes that really differentiates one from the other. And if Manny does with others what he did with me Sunday, I think we'll be on the road to full recovery.\"  Ramirez has also spoken with manager Joe Torre and general manager Ned Colletti by phone. But the outfielder was absent from Dodger Stadium again Sunday as his teammates wrapped up an 11-game homestand against San Francisco.  \"He's still beat up by this thing,\" Torre said. \"Again, it's not that he feels it's unfair, but he's embarrassed and he still has to clear his head before he basically feels good enough to come out. Hopefully it's in the near future, but we didn't nail him down for a (specific) day.\"  Before Sunday's game, Colletti confirmed a report in the Los Angeles Times that he and McCourt had spoken to Ramirez, whose bat practically carried the Dodgers into last year's playoffs and helped the club get off to a 21-8 start before the suspension.  \"All I can tell you is that we had two separate conversations. I had one with Manny, and Frank had one with Manny,\" Colletti told The Associated Press. \"I'd say my conversation was a positive one. And from what Frank has relayed to me, I would say the same. That's all I'm going to say about the conversations.\"  When asked if Ramirez's voice revealed emotion, Colletti said: \"Absolutely.\"  The Times reported on its Web site Sunday, citing unidentified sources, that McCourt was furious with Ramirez and was demanding that the star slugger speak to his teammates about the failed drug test that led to his suspension.",

        "article": "A father takes his son, a boy with special powers, on the run in “Midnight Special,” the new science-fiction thriller from the writer and director Jeff Nichols (“Take Shelter,” “Mud”).  They’re being pursued because of the boy’s supernatural abilities, which are left ambiguous through much of the movie. This scene, featuring Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton and Jaeden Lieberher, takes place at a gas station where the boy makes a discovery.  In an interview, Mr. Nichols discussed the film. Below are excerpts from that conversation.  Q. How do you see issues of faith factoring into the movie?  A. Faith is a driving factor for the plot. It’s at the core of this chase. There are people chasing them, but they’re really running toward something as well, a deadline. So it’s a chase on both ends.  The film does deal with a number of spiritual issues. What were your goals with the movie?  I see the movie being about this constant process of defining what this boy is. Especially for Michael Shannon’s character. He’s trying to figure out what this boy needs. It’s less an allegory for spirituality and more for what I think it is to be a parent.  I was so afraid when my son was born that something bad would happen to him. I was connected to a feeling that this child could die at any moment and I have no control over that. You start to extend that and say: I have zero control over who this boy grows up to be, what kind of man he grows up to be. So what am I doing then? If I can’t control the environment he’s in to keep him safe, or control the way he grows up, what’s my job here as a parent?  I quickly realized I’m constantly trying to redefine who he is. And then I just give him everything I possibly can to help him realize that. That’s the closest I’ve come to a definition of parenthood. What I really made was something to try to sum up the sense of what it feels like to be a parent and how scary it is.  Why did you decide to explore those ideas in a genre movie?  That’s the battling of two sides of myself. I started to take hold of it with “Take Shelter,” in this idea of combining art house cinema with genre. I was thinking that I wanted to do a movie that people will pay to make and eventually pay to see. I wanted to make movies for bigger and bigger audiences.  And so the genre elements in “Midnight Special” became a bigger cornerstone of the film. But oddly enough, I just made more things blow up. I came up with bigger set pieces. But the underpinnings; the desire to work against narrative cliché, the desire to remove expository dialogue and the desire to inject my personal struggles and emotions from my own life into all of this; that all remained the same.",

        "article": "There is an anecdote that Sir Nicholas Serota told in a lecture he gave in November 2000, almost exactly six months after the triumphant opening, in the gargantuan chambers of the Bankside power station in London, of Tate Modern. It concerned a civil service inquiry into the salary of the director of the Tate Gallery conducted in 1987, the year before Serota took up the post. The director’s pay, it was concluded, ought to be raised to match that of the directors of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery. Not because the Tate was intrinsically as important as these venerable institutions, but rather because “the director of the Tate has to deal with the very difficult problem of modern art”. The Tate director, in short, was due danger money for having to cope with the inexplicable, the unpopular, the controversial and the bewildering.  Serota's proposition that art made today might have something important or enriching to say to us has won out  It would be difficult, now, for even the most out-of-touch Whitehall mandarin to argue that modern art was “a very difficult problem” in British culture. Though many would argue that Britain’s relationship with contemporary culture remains unevolved compared with that of its European neighbours, there has been a vast and (it feels) irreversible change over the past 30 years. Contemporary art is no longer an embarrassment. It is completely mainstream. Serota’s simple proposition that the art being made today might have something important, enriching, surprising, disturbing, or joyful to say to us, has won out.  Politicians talk, unabashed, about the importance of Tate Modern and Frieze art fair. London has a contemporary-art economy that supports hundreds of commercial galleries and thousands of artists. Towns that could not have dreamed of supporting a modern art gallery in 1987 – from Gateshead and Wakefield to Margate and Middlesbrough – now do so. Parts of the press still, it is true, make hay with the annual Turner prize shortlist, finding controversy where they can. But perhaps, now, with a tone more of sport and playfulness than loathing. Not all of this transformation is down to the single figure of Serota. But a lot of it is.  He is an old-fashioned public servant: he believes in culture as a civic right, art a precious resource held in common  Serota is a man who can often seem forbidding, with his poker-straight backbone, firmly clenched jaw and penetrating gaze. He is, of course, ambitious and wildly determined, as you would have to be, to lead a team to open first Tate Modern and then, earlier this year, the gallery’s huge expansion. A large part of his skill has been political and diplomatic: he has persuaded successive culture ministers and chancellors he is a serious-minded, effective leader who, given just enough government support, is capable of creating something in the reflected glory of which they could bask. This skill has benefited others beyond Tate; he is one of a very few top cultural leaders who have been able to temper the severity of government cuts on the arts in general. And he has used similar resources of charm, argument and persuasion to open the wallets of legions of private donors.  Behind the skill comes the moral backbone. For all that Whitehall decided to raise his pay, his salary still hovers around the £170,000 mark. His counterpart at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Glenn Lowry, was paid $2.1m in 2013. Clearly, Serota could be making a great deal of money elsewhere, if he so wished. But he is an old-fashioned public servant. He believes in culture as a civic right; in the importance of art as a precious resource to be held in common by the nation as a whole. And he has taken Tate’s responsibility as the dominant institution in Britain’s art world seriously.  While London is overmighty in terms of the resources it receives to fund culture, Serota has always been a quiet but effective supporter of colleagues running poorer, less glamorous institutions around the country. For which reason, his next move to be chair of Arts Council England, bodes well. The arts in England could not hope for a more effective advocate at the head of its most significant funding body.  Of course, over a long career, there have been some slips, some ups and downs. There was a kerfuffle over Tate’s 2005 purchase of Chris Ofili’s installation The Upper Room while the artist was a trustee, leading to accusations of a conflict of interest. The Tate Modern extension, planned to coincide with the London Olympics, has in fact coordinated nicely with Rio, four years later. In 2015, he lost two directors – one of Tate Modern, one of Tate Britain – amid accusations that the latter gallery had lost its way.  In the end, these will be seen as small beer compared to his achievements. It all comes back to the art. A patient and wily administrator, he is, above all, a man who knows and loves art, a man who is curious about artists, a man who has curated great shows, from the hugely significant A New Spirit in Painting (1981) with Norman Rosenthal at the Royal Academy of Arts, to the glorious Cy Twombly exhibition (with Nicholas Cullinan) in 2008 at Tate Modern. Tate’s next director may be a great curator, a great administrator, or a great diplomat. They will be lucky if they can find all three qualities in one person.",

        "article": "By all accounts, they do not trust each other. President Obama has told aides and allies that he does not believe that Mr. Netanyahu will ever be willing to make the kind of big concessions that will lead to a peace deal.  For his part, Mr. Netanyahu has complained that Mr. Obama has pushed Israel too far — a point driven home during a furious phone call with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday morning, just hours before Mr. Obama’s speech, during which the prime minister reacted angrily to the president’s plan to endorse Israel’s pre-1967 borders for a future Palestinian state.  Mr. Obama did not back down. But the last-minute furor highlights the discord as they head into what one Israeli official described as a “train wreck” coming their way: a United Nations General Assembly vote on Palestinian statehood in September.  Mr. Netanyahu, his close associates say, desperately wants Mr. Obama to use the diplomatic muscle of the United States to protect Israel from the vote, not only by vetoing it in the Security Council, but also by leaning hard on America’s European allies to get them to reject it as well.  Mr. Obama has indicated that he will certainly do the first. But it remains unclear how far Mr. Obama can go to persuade Britain, France and other American allies to join the United States in rejecting the move, particularly as long as Mr. Netanyahu continues to resist endorsing the pre-1967 lines.  From the day they first met, at the King David Hotel on July 23, 2008, when Mr. Obama, then the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited Israel, the two men have struck, at most, an intellectual bond. Mr. Netanyahu, as the leader of Israel’s conservative Likud Party, was far more comfortable with the Republican Party in the United States than with Mr. Obama, the son of a Muslim man from Kenya whose introduction to the Arab-Israeli conflict was initially framed by discussions with pro-Palestinian academics.  “Their relationship is correct at best,” said Judith Kipper, director of Middle East programs at the Institute of World Affairs. Mr. Netanyahu “likes the status quo, and he particularly identifies with conservative Republicans.”  Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League and a friend of Mr. Netanyahu’s, recalled that after the first meeting, Mr. Netanyahu walked out of the hotel and told him that he had been impressed with Mr. Obama’s intellect, and that the American presidency “was his to lose.”  But things went downhill soon after Mr. Obama took office and, within months, called for a halt in Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahu refused, handing the president his first foreign policy humiliation when Mr. Obama had to abandon the demand in the face of Israel’s refusal to comply.  Compounding the problem, Mr. Netanyahu delivered a fiery speech to a pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington declaring that “Jerusalem isn’t a settlement, it’s our capital.” A furious White House promptly denied him all the trappings of a presidential meeting with Mr. Obama the next day, refusing to allow photographers to take pictures of the two men in the Oval Office, as is usually the case for meetings with foreign leaders.  Things got so bad, Mr. Foxman recalled, that Mr. Netanyahu “told me, ‘Abe, I need two hours just alone to talk to him.” Late last year, Mr. Netanyahu got his two hours at the White House with Mr. Obama, a meeting which, both American and Israeli officials say, helped clear the air. “The relationship now is very cordial,” a senior White House official said.  But the easing of tensions ended this spring when, Israeli and American officials said, Mr. Netanyahu got wind of Mr. Obama’s plans to make a major address on the Middle East, and alerted Republican leaders that he would like to address a joint meeting of Congress. That move was widely interpreted as an attempt to get out in front of Mr. Obama, by presenting an Israeli peace proposal that, while short of what the Palestinians want, would box in the president. House Speaker John A. Boehner issued the invitation, for late May.  So White House officials timed Mr. Obama’s speech on Thursday to make sure he went first.",

The FBI admitted in court that it was able to crack the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone without Apple’s help. The government on Monday said it would drop its controversial demands for the company’s technical assistance in the case.  The case is over for the time being, although Apple and other tech companies could at any moment face renewed government pressure to write software that aids law enforcement efforts. The existence of at least one demonstrable security weakness in the iPhone has been established, although the government didn’t say how it cracked the device, an older version of the iPhone that doesn’t necessarily have much bearing on the security of newer models.  Some critics have maintained that it was clear from the start that the government could have cracked the iPhone without Apple’s help. Edward Snowden made that case earlier this month, when he said that the security systems could have been overcome by “attacking” the hardware of the device, and that it wasn’t necessary to enlist Apple’s aid in writing software to break the encryption. He argued that convenience, and something more fundamental, drove the Justice Department’s demands. The Morning Download revisited that point earlier today, in a post entitled “FBI’s Retreat from Apple Battle Is Remarkable.”  As Edward Snowden said earlier this month: “They frame this false choice between security and privacy. But you can have both … Surveillance isn’t about safety. It’s about power.”  That final point about the government’s motivations touched a nerve with a number of readers, who said it went too far. “Agreed, that the retreat is remarkable — thanks for the comments,” said Dale Henn, of St. Louis, who described himself as a retired vice president of capital and facilities at Gannett Co. Inc.  He continued, in an email, which we quote in full below:  About the concept, “Surveillance isn’t about safety. It’s about power.” Perhaps true in a police state or totalitarian. Hardly relevant in the context of the U.S. vs Apple. The FBI is doing all it can to protect U.S. citizens, as it should. There is a reasonable discussion to be had about privacy vs. security. That’s happening. A great result in a democratic society.  Claiming the FBI effort is about power denigrates the difficult job the FBI has to keep us safe in a world with terrorists. The FBI went to court — they didn’t arrest or try to indict Apple/Apple employees/management.  How should the debate be resolved, publicly and legally which is happening. Should Apple be forced to hack IOS to help the FBI, I don’t think so, but the courts should decide, if necessary. One of the bedrocks of our democracy is rule of law. Another is transparency. Another is free speech. All at work in this discussion.  Painting the FBI as power hungry is unfair and untrue.  How do you view the latest twist in the battle between the FBI and Apple?

Emergency services worked for more than 40 minutes to free the man and the 60-year-old female driver after their car was struck at Emu Plains on Thursday afternoon.  The man died at the scene and the woman was taken to Westmead hospital in a critical condition but by Thursday evening was stable, a hospital spokeswoman said.  Strong winds caused trees and power lines to fall across the city’s west, and lightning strikes sparked fires in the Blue Mountains.  By early evening the SES had received more than 800 calls for help, mostly coming from suburbs in the city’s west and south.  “The storms that have come through seem to be fairly intense local impacts rather than widespread, resulting in really concentrated pockets of damage,” an SES spokeswoman said.

Nepean hospital and Westfield Miranda called in emergency services after roof damage caused water leaks.  A number of people also had to be rescued from their car after a tree fell on it in a shopping centre car park on the Great Western Highway.  The Rural Fire Service responded to reports of three fires started by lightning strikes in the Blue Mountains. All three were in remote areas of bush and are not threatening homes.

        "article": "ABU SHOUK, Sudan, July 21 -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Thursday with women who had been raped during a campaign of ethnic violence in Sudan's Darfur region, as she sought to pressure the government to deal with a problem that has persisted despite an apparent easing of the humanitarian crisis.  Rice heard the women's stories during a 90-minute stop at this sprawling camp of mud-brick homes, a showpiece that has become required stop for dignitaries visiting Darfur. Dozens of children greeted her with welcoming chants of \"Marhab, marhab, ya Condoleezza,\" but other camp residents were kept outside a compound of seven huts while she spoke with aid workers and the group of women, and gave a succession of interviews.  Rice met with about 15 women, who were shielded from public view in one of the huts, and emerged looking moved by their plight. She called their stories \"unbelievable but . . . true,\" though she declined to discuss the details because she said she feared the women were vulnerable to retribution.  Surrounded by children clutching soccer balls in the blazing heat, Rice said she had a new appreciation for what she called \"a devastating crisis for so many people,\" especially the women and children who told her \"how hard life is here.\"  After talks in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, earlier Thursday, Rice said she had obtained a commitment from senior Sudanese officials, including the president, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Bashir, to implement a plan to halt sexual attacks against women. The plan, which calls for a public campaign against violence and the prosecution of rapists, was conceived by Rice's deputy, Robert B. Zoellick, who presented it to the Khartoum government during a visit two weeks ago.  Zoellick visited this camp in April, and was told by women here that they faced the risk of attack if they left to forage for firewood, and sometimes even inside the camp at night, often by Sudanese police or military personnel who linger outside. Zoellick's plan calls for installing female security guards in the area.  But the Sudanese government has a long history of failing to meet commitments, and U.S. officials said they were skeptical that Khartoum will abide by its promise without strong international pressure. Rice said she told Sudanese officials they had a significant credibility gap and needed to demonstrate they had turned a corner.  \"The Khartoum government has promised it is going to speak out about it, that it's going to recognize the problem. We will see,\" Rice said, adding that she told the Sudanese the U.S. government wanted to see \"actions, not words.\"  [In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Thursday that although violence in Darfur has decreased in the past year, rebels and government-backed militias are still carrying out attacks, raping women and creating a climate of fear, the Associated Press reported. \"Darfur may be a less active war zone than it was a year ago, but violations of human rights continue to occur frequently and active combat has been replaced by a suffocating environment of intimidation and fear, perpetuated by ever-present militia,\" Annan said in a report to the Security Council.]  About 1.8 million people live in camps in Sudan, while another 200,000 refugees are located in camps over the border in Chad. The conflict in Darfur broke out in early 2003 when two African rebel groups attacked police stations and military outposts. The United Nations and human rights groups accuse the Arab-led central government of supporting militiamen, called the Janjaweed, to crush the rebellion. About 2,000 villages have been destroyed, and estimates of the deaths from disease and fighting range as high as 400,000.  Abu Shouk was home to 40,000 people when Rice's predecessor, Colin L. Powell, visited last June, and officials said nearly 100,000 were here when Zoellick visited. A recent census found more than 70,000. The camp, with neat rows of mud-brick homes, numbered streets and dozens of donkeys and other animals, now appears more like a small village that greets the parade of visitors with increasing indifference.  The United States last year determined that genocide had taken place in Darfur. Bashir told Rice that the government would like to disarm the Janjaweed, but he asserted that if only the militias disarmed and not the rebels, the result would be genocide, according to a U.S. official who attended the meeting. Rice responded that the Sudanese government is responsible for security in the region.  The African Union is rapidly expanding its monitoring force in Darfur from 2,700 to 7,700 by the end of September. In an unusual operation, NATO and the European Union have agreed to airlift many of the troops to Darfur; when Rice landed at an airstrip in El Fasher, Rwandan soldiers flown in Thursday on U.S. military aircraft were on hand to greet her.  The Brussels-based International Crisis Group, in a report this month, said that as many as 15,000 troops would be needed to protect villages from attack and women from rape outside the camps. Rice said that during her meetings in Khartoum, Sudanese officials said they would put no limit on how many African Union forces could be sent to Darfur.",

        "article": "Mitt Romney is sticking by his comments captured in a video at a fundraiser earlier this year in which he told donors that President Obama's base supporters are \"reliant on government,\" don't pay taxes and \"believe they are victims.\"  The Republican presidential nominee assembled a brief and to-the-point press conference Monday night to address the tape, which had been posted online by liberal magazine Mother Jones.  Romney, while saying his phrasing was not ideal, stood by the premise of his remarks, which reportedly came from a fundraiser in Florida.  \"It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way. I was speaking off the cuff in response to a question,\" Romney said, adding he wants to help \"all Americans.\"  But he continued: \"It's a message which I am going to carry and continue to carry, which is that the president's approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes because frankly my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them. Therefore I'm not likely to draw them into my campaign as effectively as those in the middle.\"  The video was widely circulated after it was obtained by Mother Jones, though it had been on the Internet for weeks. It showed Romney speaking at a May 17 fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla.  \"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\" Romney could be heard saying. \"There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.\"  Romney added his job as a presidential candidate was \"not to worry about those people.\"  Democrats seized on the tape, claiming they showed the GOP candidate was out of touch. The Obama campaign slammed the comments Monday, calling them \"shocking.\"  \"It's hard to serve as president for all Americans when you've disdainfully written off half the nation,\" said Jim Messina, campaign manager for Obama for America.  Romney, in his press conference, called for some context. He urged whoever made the video to release it in full rather than the few clips that had been posted online.  But he went on to echo largely his original remarks.  \"I believe the point I was made is that the president starts off with a large number of the voters, 47, 48, 49 percent, something like that. These are people who are in his camp and they will vote for him almost no matter what,\" he said.  \"Of course there's a very different approach of the two different campaigns, as I point out I recognize that among those that pay no tax, approximately 47 percent of Americans, I'm not likely to be highly successful with the message of lowering taxes. That's not as attractive to those who don't pay income taxes as it is to those who do. And likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government. And so I then focus on those individuals who I believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp.\"  In a new clip Mother Jones released Tuesday, Romney also told the donors that Palestinians \"have no interest\" in peace with Israel. He says Palestinians are \"committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel\" and that the prospects for a two-state solution to Mideast peace were dim.  \"You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem ... and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it,\" Romney said. He said pushing Israel to give up disputed territory for a two-state solution with the Palestinians \"is the worst idea in the world.\"  The Romney campaign on Tuesday defended those comments as well.  \"Gov. Romney laid out a detailed description of the many difficult issues that must be solved in order to reach a two-state solution. And as he's often said, there is this one obvious truth: peace will not be possible if the extreme elements of the Palestinian side refuse to come to the table for talks or to recognize Israel's right to exist,\" spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The singer re-joins the label after a split that previously lead him to write the word ‘slave’ on his face and change his name to an unpronounceable symbol in an attempt to disrupt his contract.  According to a press release, the new deal will provide Prince with the rights to the master recordings of his classic albums in “an exclusive global licensing partnership that covers every album released from 1978 into the ‘90s”. Prince left the label in 1996 after a long waged a war with the music industry convention in the name of artists' rights.

As part of the new deal, a digitally remastered deluxe edition of Prince’s classic album Purple Rain will be released to mark its 30th anniversary. Further re-releases are expected to follow, as well as a new studio album with Prince’s current band 3RDEYEGIRL, reportedly entitled Plectrum Electrum.  Prince stated: \"A brand-new studio album is on the way and both Warner Bros Records and Eye [sic] are quite pleased with the results of the negotiations and look forward to a fruitful working relationship.”  \"Everyone at Warner Bros.

Truth is, we all think our metabolic rate is slowww -- and assume that speeding it up would require two-hour runs and boot camp till we're wrecked. Not so. In fact, all the little decisions you make about eating and moving make a big difference in your calorie-torching ability.  \"Your metabolism isn't fixed,\" says exercise physiologist Gary Ditsch. \"You can impact it significantly with your daily activity and diet.\"  Adopt a few of these strategies to get the metabolism you crave -- in the time you have.  We all know weight-lifting builds muscle, and the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. What you may not realize is that the calorie burn continues long after your last rep. In a study at Southern Illinois University, exercisers who did a 15-minute resistance routine burned 100 extra calories a day for three days afterward.  Health.com: 20 ways to burn 200 calories  \"Strength training causes micro trauma to the muscles,\" says Wayne Westcott, director of fitness research at Quincy College in Massachusetts. \"Your body has to rebuild the muscle.\"  It does that by torching additional protein and carbs. Boost your fat burning: Three days a week, do 1 to 3 sets each of five resistance exercises (think push-ups and squats).  2. Lift first, do cardio second  Exercisers who pumped iron 20 minutes before cycling melted more fat than those who didn't lift or those who waited longer between lifting and doing cardio. So move right from the hand weights to that bike or treadmill.  Health.com: Fastest fat burners ever!

Cyclists who pedaled at an all-out effort with high resistance for a total of five 30-second sprints (that's just 2.5 minutes!) burned a whopping 200 calories, according to recent Colorado State University research.  Don't forget to recover between intervals: Here participants recouped with four minutes of slow pedaling with low resistance after each burst.  \"Changing the intensity forces your muscles to work harder,\" says Andia Winslow, a personal trainer in New York.  Health.com: Strength moves that burn fat  It will keep your metabolism humming when you're just bumming around. In a University of Utah study, participants who downed eight to 12 glasses of water a day burned more calories at rest than those who drank four.  Water not your cup of tea? Freeze bits of peeled citrus fruit and use them in place of ice cubes.  Exercisers who drank a 250-calorie shake with 24 grams of protein and 36 grams of carbs after strength training lost about four pounds more fat and created one and a half pounds more lean muscle in six months than those who didn't drink the shake, Westcott says. His research links the protein-carb hit with muscle building and fat loss.

        "article": "Kay Ryan’s poems are as slim as runway models, so tiny you could almost tweet them. Their compact refinement, though, does not suggest ease or chic. Her voice is quizzical and impertinent, funny in uncomfortable ways, scuffed by failure and loss. Her mastery, like Emily Dickinson’s, has some awkwardness in it, some essential gawkiness that draws you close.  Ms. Ryan’s new book, “The Best of It,” is a generous and nearly career-spanning collection of her verse (it omits poems from her earliest books), a greatest-hits album of a sort. But its title isn’t a generic boast. “The Best of It” is also the name of a pint-size destroyer from her volume “The Niagara River” (2005), a poem that reads in its entirety:  However carved up or pared down we get, we keep on making the best of it as though it doesn’t matter that our acre’s down to a square foot. As though our garden could be one bean and we’d rejoice if it flourishes, as though one bean could nourish us.  Ms. Ryan, born in 1945, is an unusual poet and an unusual person. Her father was an oil-well driller in the San Joaquin Valley of California. She attended a community college before the University of California, Los Angeles, and published her first book of poems, “Dragon Acts to Dragon Ends” (1983), herself.  She is now the 16th poet laureate of the United States, but she mostly steers clear of the poetry world’s junketeering, its voluptuous horror of conferences and panels and M.F.A. programs. She has taught the same remedial English course, at the same community college in Marin County, Calif., for more than 30 years.  How unhip is Kay Ryan? Much of her poetry rhymes, for God’s sake, something almost no one’s does anymore. Her rhymes are “recombinant”  that is, as she has put it, they tend to be stashed “at the wrong ends of lines and at the middles.” These rhymes are often stealthy, and just as often they flash like turn signals. Both sorts are evident in “Among English Verbs”:  Among English verbs to die is oddest in its eagerness to be dead, immodest in its haste to be told  a verb alchemical in the head: one speck of its gold and a whole life’s lead.  Ms. Ryan wears her influences lightly but openly, admitting that “we are beholden/to the sources we crib /always something’s overflow,/or someone’s rib hidden in our breast.” Dickinson is among those influences, but also Marianne Moore. Randall Jarrell once praised Moore for not putting on “Poetic airs,” for “her restraint, her lack  her wonderful lack  of arbitrary intensity or violence.” He could just as easily have been describing Ms. Ryan’s verse.  Marianne Moore’s famous observation about poetry  that it cultivates “imaginary gardens with real toads in them”  applies to Ms. Ryan’s work too. Warty observations leap from it. “The things of the world/want us for dinner./Inside each pebble or leaf/or puddle is a hook,” she writes in “The Things of the World.” And, as she observes in a poem called “Bitter Pill”:  A bitter pill doesn’t need to be swallowed to work. Just reading your name on the bottle does the trick.  A few of Ms. Ryan’s poems flirt with glibness, and some are stunted vignettes. Sometimes she simply gets off on the wrong foot. I’m not sure anyone could write a good poem that begins, “Not every day/is a good day/for the elfin tailor.” She definitely doesn’t.  She guards against deploying too many mere “thoughtlets,” as she calls them, but too much dead intellectual weight can kill a poem too. “Great thoughts/do not nourish/small thoughts/as parents do children,” she notes in a poem called “Great Thoughts,” before continuing:  Like the eucalyptus, they make the soil beneath them barren. Standing in a grove of them is hideous.  Ms. Ryan is suspicious of the polished and affable (“It’s her politeness/one loathes,” one poem begins), and a quickening bit of class awareness snakes through them. In a poem called “Apology” she writes:  I thought you were born to privilege, some inherited advantage  like an estate framed in privet hedge, or a better-feathered shuttlecock for badinage, or other French pretensions. I never thought you knew about exhaustion.  She is unpredictable, however, in her fondness for underdogs. Her hilarious broadside against outsider art (“There never/seems to be a surface equal/to the needs of these people”) is a put-down for the ages.  You can’t help consuming Kay Ryan’s poems quickly, the way you are supposed to consume freshly made cocktails: while they are still smiling at you. But you immediately double back  what was that?  and their moral and intellectual bite blindsides you.  So does their darting mischievousness, a quality hinted at in a poem called “Sheep in Wolves’ Clothing,” which speaks of a  true wolf philosophy, which states very clearly that every bluff must promote good. Which means you eat what you’ve fooled: all of Little Red Riding, from her shoes to her hood.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Syrian opposition factions formally agreed Sunday to unite as the National Coalition Forces of the Syrian Revolution, a spokesman for the Syrian National Council told CNN.  The SNC has been under pressure by the United States and Arab nations, primarily Qatar, to unite with various other opposition groups in Syria's civil war.  The agreement, signed at a meeting in Doha, Qatar, stated a goal of a crackdown on the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, with no dialogue with the regime and the acceptance only of a new government, the spokesman said.  SNC member Ahmed Muaz al-Khatib was selected chairman of the coalition, according to SNC member Mohammed Dugham. Two vice presidents -- Riad Seif and Suhair Atassi -- were picked, as well as Mustafa Al-Sabagh to be secretary general, he said.  The new president is \"a moderate religious figure,\" while one of the vice presidents -- Atassi -- is a \"very well respected\" woman, according to Rafif Jouejati, a spokesman for the Local Coordination Committees of Syria.  \"I'm happy they have chosen a path that can unify the opposition,\" Jouejati said.  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani praised the formation of the coalition, saying to its members, \"The culmination of your meeting by agreement came to prove to your people and to the international community your keenness on the success of your revolution in order to achieve your legitimate rights.\"  The move comes as fighting between government and rebel forces escalated amid reports that al-Assad is losing his grip on the country that his family has ruled for more than four decades.  The Syrian Human Rights Network -- al-Assad's answer to the opposition-linked rights groups the Local Coordination Committees of Syria and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights -- accused the countries supporting the opposition conference in Qatar of sponsoring terrorism.  Al-Assad has refused to acknowledge the civil war, saying repeatedly his government is fighting foreign-backed \"terrorists\" bent on destabilizing the country.  Al-Khatib, new president of the opposition coalition, is a former Sunni imam of the historic Ummayad mosque in Damascus. He has been detained at least three times since the revolution began, the last time in April, according to a Facebook page created to promote his release. He was freed and left the country, the page said.  Vice President Seif is a prominent dissident and businessman from Damascus. He served in the Syrian parliament as an independent.  Vice President Atassi is from a prominent Syrian family and is well known for being outspoken against the government. She has also been an advocate for women's rights, calling the civil war a revolution for equality.  Israel responds to Syrian mortar fire in Golan Heights  Israel fired warning shots toward Syria Sunday after a mortar shell hit an Israeli military post -- the first time Israel has fired on its neighbor across the Golan Heights since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  The Israeli military said it was not a targeted attack on Israel, but part of the \"internal conflict in Syria.\"  The mortar shell from Syria hit an IDF post in the Golan Heights adjacent to the Israel-Syria border, an Israeli military spokeswoman said.  Israel has filed a complaint through U.N. forces operating in the area, \"stating that fire emanating from Syria into Israel will not be tolerated and shall be responded to with severity,\" the IDF said.  The UN secretary-general reacted with a statement Sunday saying he \"is deeply concerned by the potential for escalation.\"  \"He calls for the utmost restraint and urges Syria and Israel to uphold the Disengagement Agreement, respect their mutual obligations, and halt firing of any kind across the ceasefire line,\" the UN statement said.  Israeli Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said of the fire from Syria, \"We interpret it as pinpoints leaks into Israel territory. It's totally internal conflict in Syria. We believe that Israel is not the target here. We are looking at either stray bullets or stray mortars.\"  Israel's ambassador to the United States told CNN Sunday that \"A greater possibility is the inundation of refugees -- Christian, Druze, Alawites.\"  \"We'd give them refuge,\" Oren said. \"These are populations with which we have good relations. It's not unprecedented. We've been prepared for it for a long time but it hasn't happened.\"  Israel is also concerned the Syrian civil war \"gushes rather than seeps\" across the border into Lebanon, Oren said.  \"So far that hasn't happened on a large scale either,\" he said. \"But then we have a security issue on the Lebanese border. You can't discount the possibility that if Hezbollah feels that its legitimacy is being challenged in Lebanon that it will seek to re-establish its legitimacy by doing something against us.\"  Sunday's incident in the Golan Heights area is the fourth such complaint Israel has filed, though so far no one has been injured.  Syrian tanks entered the Golan Heights demilitarized zone last week and fired into Syria; bullets fired at the tanks in response struck an Israeli military vehicle in part of the Golan Heights that Israel claims as its own. Mortars also fell in part of the Golan that Israel considers its territory.  The Golan is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite Israeli governmental control. It is home to 41,000 residents -- including Jews, Druze and Alawites. Israel seized the territory from Syria during the 1967 Israel-Arab war, and it was eventually annexed.  At least 90 killed across Syria  The nearly 20-month conflict in Syria has its roots it the success of popular uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, with Syrian demonstrators taking to the streets echoing the calls of Arab Spring protesters for political reform and political freedoms. The violence has taken hold of towns in the north, forcing thousands of Syrians to flee across the border into Turkey.  Al-Assad ordered a brutal crackdown against demonstrators, a move that spawned an armed uprising that has since devolved into a civil war.  At least 90 people were killed in fighting across Syria Sunday, the LCC reported. At least 35 of them were killed in Damascus and its suburbs.  More than 35,000 people are believed to have been killed in the fighting, and more than 400,000 people have been displaced, according to opposition and United Nations estimates.  CNN's Raja Razek in Beirut, Samira Said and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.",

        "article": "From about 150 euros, or $158 at $1.05 to the euro.  The NH Collection Torino Piazza Carlina opened last winter in a 17th-century palazzo that was, in the early 1900s, the home of Antonio Gramsci, the politician who co-founded the Communist Party of Italy. The 160-room hotel is part of the NH Hotel Group but offers slightly more luxurious lodging than is typical for the Spanish-based brand, known for its basic rooms and moderate prices. The historic five-story property has been given some modern touches, like the futuristic light installation and artistic photo-collage that greet guests at reception. But many period details have been preserved, including beautiful stone mosaics in a large central courtyard surrounded by arcades, which are suggestive of the covered walkways called portici that hug miles of boulevards and vast piazzas around the city.  Conveniently located in central Turin on the southeastern corner of Piazza Carlo Emanuele II, the hotel is equidistant from the Po River and the grand Piazza San Carlo. It’s a short walk to the train station, most museums and tourist attractions, as well as to the historic quarter’s many restaurants and aperitivo bars.  My third-floor room was a study in Italian minimalism. Neutral hues and natural wood floors served as the backdrop for simple furnishings: a plum-colored armchair, a desk and desk chair, two bedside tables and the bed, which was actually two double beds pushed together. The walls were free of decorations or art; the only flourishes were a pile of Italian fashion magazines beside the bed, an enormous framed mirror on one wall, and a tray of minibar treats temptingly arranged on the desk. The ceilings were unusually high, and light streamed through the tall windows and glass-paned French doors, which opened onto a narrow balcony facing the central courtyard.  Spacious and bright with white subway tile and hardwood floors, the bathroom had a generously sized, well-lit vanity and an array of NH-branded toiletries. There was also a bidet beside the toilet, a warming rack for towels and a large shower stall with sliding glass doors and both rainfall and hand-held showerheads.  On the top floor of the hotel, a wood-paneled atticlike space has been outfitted as a gym with equipment and cardio machines, some tucked in window alcoves. On the rooftop, two terraces offer panoramic views of the city, including the slim spire of Turin’s most recognizable landmark, the Mole Antonelliana. And off the lobby, a bar area is a cozy refuge with low-slung lounge chairs and a handsome cedar bar. In all public areas and rooms, there’s free Wi-Fi.  An elegant, two-room restaurant serves traditional Piedmontese cuisine at lunch and dinner, and a daily breakfast buffet (included in my rate) is offered beside the courtyard, with tables set up nearby in the sunny arcade. Room service is available around the clock (five-euro delivery fee), with a menu that consisted mainly of simple salads, sandwiches and pastas. Breakfast can also be served in the room, and my order — a tray laden with pastries and rolls, muesli with yogurt, cappuccino and fresh orange juice — arrived promptly.  A dash of history and tasteful design in a city-center location is a winning combination, whatever your political affiliation.

        "article": "CHISINAU, Moldova â American officials plan to present the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, with detailed ideas about security arrangements on the West Bank under a possible peace agreement with the Palestinians, senior State Department officials said on Wednesday.  John R. Allen, the former American commander in Afghanistan, will present the West Bank security proposal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday.  Secretary of State John Kerry walks with officials from Moldova, in a visit to provide support to Eastern European nations.  The presentation is to be made to Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday by John R. Allen, the former American commander in Afghanistan and a retired Marine general who serves as an adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry on the Middle East peace talks.  It will be General Allenâs first briefing to the Israeli prime minister, and will be provided when Mr. Kerry meets with Mr. Netanyahu, officials said. General Allen has made several trips to Israel and developed his ideas in consultation with Israeli officials.  âIt will include many details and specifics,â said a State Department official who asked not to be identified under diplomatic protocol established by the agency. âHe will be presenting a piece of what will be a larger whole.â  Mr. Kerry is making a quick trip to Moldova on Wednesday to provide political support to Eastern European nations that are seeking closer political and economic ties with the European Union.  State Department officials described the security briefing as an âongoing processâ and not a finished product on which the United States was demanding a yes-or-no vote from the Israeli side.  In Jerusalem, Mark Regev, a spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu, declined to comment Wednesday on the briefing plans.  Mr. Kerry has previously shared with Mr. Netanyahu some of the ideas that General Allen will be outlining, said the officials who are traveling with the secretary of state.  Still, General Allenâs presentation appears to signify a more active American role, in which the United States is doing more than coaxing the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate and is presenting its own ideas.  Officials involved in the negotiations said security had been the prime focus lately, with most of the discussion revolving around the Jordan Valley. Israel has insisted that its own military continue to patrol there, rather than rely on an international force similar to those responsible for its tense borders with Lebanon and Syria. The Palestinians have said they cannot abide the presence of any Israeli soldiers in their future state.  The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told diplomats at a dinner in Jerusalem on Friday night that they needed to put more pressure on Israel for the peace talks to progress. Since the latest round of negotiations began, Mr. Erekat said, Israel has demolished 159 Palestinian homes, killed 23 Palestinians and moved forward on constructing 5,992 new apartments in West Bank settlements.  âWe can deliver an agreement if we have a partner in the state of Israel willing to stand up and say, âWe want a two-state solution on the 1967 border,â â Mr. Erekat said in a speech marking the United Nations-declared day of solidarity with the Palestinians. âI am the most disadvantaged negotiator in the history of the world â I have no army, no navy, no air force, no border; I have no economy.â  Mr. Erekat told the diplomats that the Palestinians could never accede to Israelâs demand that they recognize it as the nation-state of the Jewish people. âI cannot change my narrative,â he said. âThe essence of peace is not to convert each otherâs stories.â  When he arranged the resumption of peace talks in July, Mr. Kerry said he hoped to reach a deal in nine months. American officials have insisted that both sides keep the negotiations confidential, but there has been little visible progress.  A report about General Allenâs impending briefing first surfaced in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.  After leaving Moldova, Mr. Kerry plans to continue on to Israel on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr. Kerry will also be meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.  Mr. Kerry will stay in Israel on Friday and plans to return to Washington that night.

        "article": "The EU’s refugee registration system on the Greek islands has created a three-tier structure that favours certain nationalities over others, encourages some ethnic groups to lie about their backgrounds to secure preferential treatment, and has led to a situation Human Rights Watch calls absolute chaos.  The dynamic will increase fears over the security threat posed by the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe amid a backlash against refugees after the Paris attacks. The passport of a Syrian refugee who passed through Greece was found on or near the body of a dead suicide bomber.  It will also amplify calls to scale up resettlement schemes from the Middle East, which will help Europe to improve screening of refugees and give them an incentive not to take the boat to Greece.  Related: Aid groups say Balkan states blocking refugees based on nationality  Syrian families arriving on the island of Lesbos, where nearly 400,000 asylum seekers have landed so far in 2015, are separated from other nationalities and given expedited treatment that allows them to leave the island for mainland Europe within 24 hours. Syrian males, Yemenis and Somalis are registered in a separate and slower camp but still receive preferential treatment and are usually able to continue their journey within a day.  But a third category of asylum seekers – including many from war-torn countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan – are being processed in another camp where there are roughly half as many passport-scanners. The result is a chaotic parallel registration process that can last up to a week, and which has left many non-Syrians sleeping outside in the cold for several nights while they wait to be registered.  The Guardian found families living in dire, unsanitary conditions in an olive grove surrounding the main registration centre. They said they were receiving just one significant meal a day, and had resorted to burning trees to keep warm at night. Even once they are finally processed, Afghans only receive one month’s leave to remain in Greece, while Syrians are given six months.  The island’s mayor, Spyros Galinos, told the Guardian that the three-track process is to prevent fighting between different ethnic groups and nationalities. But the director of one of the three camps, Spyros Kourtis, admitted that non-Syrians are given lower priority because officials assume that they do not have as strong a claim for asylum.  “In the [lowest-priority] camp, there are the Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis who are mostly migrants, economic migrants,” said Kourtis, in an interview with the Guardian. By contrast, he said that the better-equipped centre was for “people who come from countries with a refugee profile”.  The system has been met with fury by some Afghans and Iraqis, who resent being treated as second-tier applicants even though they believe they have just as good a claim for asylum as many Syrians. “It is approximately seven days since we arrived here,” shouted an Afghan from Surkh-Rud province, where he said there is a heavy Islamic State presence. “Everything is done through favouritism. We Afghans seem to be worthless. What is it that we have done wrong? We are also humans. Our country is burning in the fire of war.”  The frustration has led to tensions between Afghans and other groups in their camp. “Pakistan is an insecure country?” said an Afghan to a Pakistani, incredulous that the latter had reason to leave home. “Some people [are insecure], some areas,” replied the Pakistani, perhaps referring to the instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has displaced over 700,000.  Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, spent several weeks this autumn on the Greek islands and along the Balkan route, and said the inconsistencies of the system have created “absolute chaos”.  Bouckaert said: “It has created a system where Syrians are being processed very quickly, and many Afghans and Iraqis are being left for as long as a week without enough humanitarian support.”  He added that there is legal basis for differentiating between different nationalities, since Syrians are statistically more likely to receive asylum than other people. “But what is unacceptable is that [non-Syrians] are being left without proper humanitarian support.”  Related: How easy is it to buy a fake Syrian passport?  Syrians also receive a comparatively warmer welcome in Germany, where the interior minister said it is unacceptable that so many Afghans are trying to seek asylum, and expressed disappointment that they are not attempting to rebuild their war-torn country. In the Balkan countries between Greece and Germany, governments this week also began differentiating between nationalities, blocking access to Africans and south Asians. Confusingly, however, they are still giving priority to Afghans – unlike Germany and Greece.  In Greece, the partial treatment has led some Iraqis to pretend to be Syrians in order to speed up their registration – a dynamic that highlights the security flaws in the registration process. A Syrian father who arrived in Lesbos this month said he thought his family were the only Syrians on his dinghy of roughly 40 people. He claimed that many of the rest were Iraqis who pretended to be Syrians to get preferential treatment. “Before we even arrived on the Greek shores, they were told to say they were Syrians,” said Abdallah Hassan, from Damascus. “Nobody is to say that they are Iraqi.”  Greek officials have separated and prioritised Syrians over other nationalities for most of the summer. But the bias became especially pronounced this autumn, after the EU introduced a so-called hotspot system. In theory the new scheme was supposed to streamline the process of registering asylum seekers in Lesbos, tighten up security, and ensure that a greater number of frauds are identified and caught.  But in reality, since EU countries sent less than half as many border officials as they had promised, officials do not have the resources to make the new system work fast enough.  Frontex, the EU border agency, requested 775 border guards to make the system more secure, but so far the organisation has been sent just 320 – with 67 stationed on Lesbos itself. By 4 November, two of the EU’s most isolationist countries – Poland and Slovakia – had not sent a single border guard, while a third, Hungary, had sent four. This contributed to a slowing-down of operations on Lesbos, particularly for non-Syrians, and increased incentives for people to lie about their identity.  Related: Refugee crisis: apart from Syrians, who is travelling to Europe?  Bouckaert said: “One of the fallouts of this policy is that this has created a huge market for fake passports in Turkey. Many non-Syrians want to pass through [the Syrian camp] so many Iraqis and Lebanese are buying fake passports to be processed [faster].”  Rights groups argue that the security and humanitarian problems with the registration system on the islands highlight the need to scale up the resettlement of refugees living in the Middle East, since this would allow Europe to screen refugees before they arrive, and also give refugees an incentive against risking death at sea.  Michael Diedring, secretary general for the European Council for Refugees and Exiles, a coalition of 90 migrant rights groups, said: “This certainly amplifies calls for more resettlement schemes in the EU ... By using safe and legal channels for persons in need of international protection, one would reduce the need to resort to the use of prioritised treatment of certain nationalities. In addition, more resettlement would also disrupt the business model of human smugglers.”  A Frontex spokeswoman said that the number of EU officials on the islands is increasing all the time, and said that her agency was not involved in the decision to create a three-tier system. Izabella Cooper said that “organisation of the management of the registration and identification process is the exclusive responsibility of the Greek national authorities.”  The central Greek government did not respond to requests for comment within two days. A spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency said that since the Guardian’s visit, conditions at the Afghan camp have improved, and that the registration system there is working much more smoothly.",

        "article": "Each Tuesday, WhatIfSports.com's NFL simulation engine generates predictions and box scores for every NFL game for the coming week. Our highly sophisticated algorithms simulate every play of every game to produce each team's likelihood to win. Each matchup is simulated 501 times.  To account for injuries and roster moves announced late in the week, we will be re-simulating games on Thursdays through the season.  Note: our predictions use the latest available team and player information, while NFL SimMatchup includes all players that were or will be available at any point during the 2015 season so that theoretical and \"what if\" scenarios can be simulated.  Week 4 was a “prove it” week for multiple teams, and most passed the test. The undefeated Atlanta Falcons went up against the Houston Texans in our Game of the Week, and as predicted, they continued their hot start to the season with a big win. Our Lock of the Week was the Colts winning against the Jags, and even without Andrew Luck, Indy pulled it off. For the week, our NFL simulation engine finished 9-6 and 4-4 against the spread.  Nailed It: The NFL simulation engine had no problems with the Denver-Minnesota game. The engine predicted the Broncos would win by an average score of 27-20. The actual final score? Broncos 23, Vikings 20.  Wide Right: It’s fitting that the Buffalo Bills show up here at least once, right? The NFL simulation engine predicted the Bills would beat the Giants by an average score of 26-20 and win 64.4 percent of the time, but the Giants took care of business and upset the Bills 24-10 instead.  Track our 2015 performance or view our accuracy last season.  Week 5 Game to Watch  Seattle at Cincinnati: The undefeated Bengals will play host to the reigning NFC champs on Sunday, and this may be the closest game the NFL simulation engine will predict all year long. The Bengals are predicted to win 51.5 percent of the time by an average score of 22-21. It doesn’t get much closer than that.  Jacksonville (+2.5) at Tampa Bay: It’s not often you’ll see the Jaguars picked as an upset pick on the road, but the Bucs might be in trouble come Sunday. Our NFL simulation engine has the Jags pulling out the victory 50.4 percent of the time with an average score of 24-23.  Fantasy Start – Arian Foster, HOU: Despite a slow start in his return to action in Week 4, the NFL simulation engine is predicting big things for the Texans star back against the Colts. Foster is projected to be the third highest scoring running back with 16.1 fantasy points scored.  Fantasy Sit – C.J. Anderson, DEN: The matchup is right with a game against a leaky Oakland defense, but the projections aren’t favorable for Anderson. The engine has Ronnie Hillman (11.5 fantasy points) doing much more damage than Anderson (6.9) in this one.  Fantasy Add – Duke Johnson, Jr., CLE: After two big games in a row catching the ball, the NFL simulation engine is projecting the rookie to lead Cleveland’s backfield and have a nice outing (9.1 fantasy points) against the Baltimore Ravens.

        "article": "It’s the unlikeliest of tell-all memoirs, co-written by the normally private Gloria Vanderbilt and her son, the even more discreet Anderson Cooper.  The high-profile pair openly discuss the most painful events of their lives in “The Rainbow Comes and Goes” — everything from his older brother’s 1988 suicide to his grandfather’s self-destructive alcoholism.  Vanderbilt even recently admitted to Cooper that she shared “this sort of lesbian relationship” while a teen at boarding school.  Over the ensuing decades, she reports affairs with Frank Sinatra and Howard Hughes — along with a one-night stand with Marlon Brando.  The book is drawn from a year-long email conversation between the CNN anchor/“60 Minutes” correspondent and Vanderbilt as her 91st birthday neared.  There was plenty that Vanderbilt, now 92 and famous from birth, hadn't told her son.  She was an 18-month-old when her father, Reginald, died of cirrhosis of the liver. The great-grandson of the fortune-building Commander Cornelius boozed away the big bucks.  Her young mother, Gloria — they shared the same name — snatched her daughter off to Europe to lead a life of debauchery on the child's trust fund.  After that, the closest Gloria Vanderbilt came to her surviving parent was caressing her mother’s beautiful clothes while a maid ironed them.  The two led an itinerant life, dictated by the widow's whirlwind social life across Europe. Just when it looked as if she were about to marry a penniless German prince came a dramatic development.  Gloria's grandmother, Nancy Morgan, and her beloved nanny Dodo kidnapped the child, spiriting her back to the U.S. and her Aunt Gertrude Whitney — the famed heiress and founder of the Whitney Museum.  The 1934 custody battle made international headlines as \"The Trial of Century.\" In the book, Gloria recalls seeing a copy of the Daily News front page shouting “Poor Little Rich Girl\" over her picture. She vowed never to let the headline become a prophecy.  She didn't know her mother was fighting more for her trust fund than her companionship, but the 10-year-old was determined to stay with her aunt and told the judge that.  Little Gloria secretly feared that returning to her mother would mean giving up her beloved surrogate mom Dodo, whose name was Emma Sullivan Keslich.  Her heart broke when the judge ruled she would live with Whitney but that Dodo, who had plotted against her mother, would have to go.  Vanderbilt's mother had her revenge in time. Her daughter was just 17, naïve and beautiful, when her mother threw her to the wolves of Hollywood.  In the book, Gloria says she now sees that her mother was trying to lure her from \"Aunt Ger\" by letting her do whatever she wanted on her rare California visits.  The plot was a success that ended in disaster.  The fresh-faced heiress barely saw her mother. But with her approval, Gloria was out every night with Hollywood's most notorious womanizers, the likes of Errol Flynn and Ray Milland.  The teenager took up with Pat DiCicco, 33, a low-life gangster and gambler, at the same time she was having an affair with his boss, Howard Hughes.  Hughes, 36, was \"wildly romantic and gentle, yet he had the power to rule the world,\" she writes. She doesn't spare her 48-year-old son the details.  Letters written by Gloria Vanderbilt to her mother. These letters were used during testimony at the custody hearings in which Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney was given custody of the daughter of Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.  \"The sex worked,\" she crowed in an email.  The intimidating DiCicco strong-armed her into marriage, with her mother's rabid consent, in 1941.  It was a miserable union, with the abusive DiCicco flying into rages where he would bang her head against the wall. When Vanderbilt came into her $4.5 million inheritance at 21, she paid him $200,000 to disappear.  She quickly fell into the arms of the lionized 63-year-old conductor, Leopold Stokowski, who ditched Greta Garbo to marry Vanderbilt. The couple had two sons, Stanley and Christopher.  Sinatra was the \"knight in shining armor who came and rescued me from Stokowski.\" Their brief affair was her springboard to divorce after nine years.  The still-willowy Vanderbilt dated the famous, including a brief rendezvous with Brando before her marriage to director Sidney Lumet.  She left him in 1963 for her true love, the handsome author and screenwriter, Wyatt Cooper. Their romance ended in heartbreak when he died during open-heart surgery in 1978, leaving her to raise their two sons, Carter and Anderson.  Anderson was 10, the exact age of his mother when she was forced to leave her childhood behind in the separation from Dodo.  As an adult, she reunited with Dodo, who lived with her for years. Yet Vanderbilt let Keslich die alone in the care of Catholic Charities, coldly throwing a deathbed letter sent by the old woman into the fire.  “Why didn't you read the letter?” her son inquires. Vanderbilt doesn't have an answer, though she says the betrayal \"haunts me to this day.\"  The mother and son discussion is always loving, even as Anderson tells her he left part of himself behind when his father died — in part because he had to worry so much about her.  \"I am a fraction of who I once was, who I was meant to be,\" he wrote.  The happy, outgoing boy became a guarded and anxious little man struggling to take on adult responsibilities because he didn't trust that his mother would.  Cooper grew up with only a fuzzy understanding of his mother's storied family and its fabulous wealth. He was also warned early by his parents that there would be no inheritance.  Never thinking of himself as a Vanderbilt and beset by anxiety, a 12-year-old Cooper started modeling for Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.  The teenager would lie awake nights trying to figure out how he would support the three of them when he grew up.  In all ways, their mother-son relationship was unusual. Twice she took Carter and Anderson to Studio 54. Even though he was just a teen, she freely confided in Cooper about her affair with a married man.  In 1979, Gloria Vanderbilt jeans became a global phenomenon and the heiress was finally truly rich. But her therapist and lawyer defrauded Vanderbilt, leaving her to face financial ruin in the late 1980s.  In 1988, Carter killed himself as his mother watched helplessly in her Upper East Side apartment. The emotionally disheveled 23-year-old ran upstairs, and Vanderbilt found him sitting on a ledge 14 stories above the street.  Vanderbilt begged her son to come inside, but instead Carter \"spun off the ledge,\" hanging onto the balcony.  \"After a few seconds, he let go,\" Cooper writes.  In the wake of the tragedy, another strained undercurrent in the mother-son relationship surfaced.  When he returned to Yale, Cooper left a letter saying \"From now on we are partners\" and \"Don't drink.\"  Cooper tells her that as “occasional and unpredictable\" as her drinking was, he felt like alcohol was a \"constant presence\" throughout his childhood.  \"Your drinking made it difficult to trust you ... The person you became (when drunk) scared and angered me,\" he writes.  Following Carter's death, Cooper feared that his mother would start drinking again. If she did, he writes, “I would have shut myself off from you for my own protection.”  Though Cooper \"longed for a sense of safety as a teenager,\" he also courted danger. At 17, he took a solo survival trip alone through Africa that ended after several months with his hospitalization in Kenya with malaria.  Indicative of their relationship, Vanderbilt sent him off on the perilous journey with a note insisting \"you must not worry about me.\"  Cooper never sounds resentful. In fact, as their email conversation wears on, he recognizes their shared \"exhausting\" impulsivity and restlessness.  Both, he acknowledges, seeded his career as a war correspondent.  He was 21 when he told his mother he was gay, worried it would awaken complicated feelings for her. Vanderbilt's mother caused yet another scandal when her lesbian relationship with a British socialite made headlines in the 1930s.  It was during an interview with People that Vanderbilt admitted she'd had a brief lesbian relationship at 13 with another student at Miss Porter's School, the elite girls boarding school in Connecticut.  \"This is news to me,\" the CNN anchor laughed.  Mother and son put their their new-found closeness on display in a series of conversations filmed for an HBO documentary, \"Nothing Left Unsaid,\" airing on April 9.",

        "article": "\"Terry has been diagnosed with Primary Progressive Aphasia, a variant of Frontotemporal Dementia,\" a representative for Jones said in a statement released through BAFTA. \"This illness affects his ability to communicate and he is no longer able to give interviews.\"  The statement came along with news that the academy will present its Special Award for Outstanding Contribution to Film and Television to Jones.  Though famous for Python, the 74-year-old has also written and directed drama films, presented documentaries, composed operas, written short stories and published poems.  Primary progressive aphasia is described by the National Aphasia Association as a rare neurological syndrome that affects a person's ability to communicate. The syndrome is often a result of strokes or head injuries and can occur in other neurological disorders, including brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease.  Symptoms often begin about age 60 and gradually worsen over time. People with primary progressive aphasia can eventually lose their ability to understand written or spoken language.  Most people with the condition are between 40 and 80, though men are affected twice as often as women, the association said. Although some patients may benefit from speech therapy, no medicines exist to treat the condition.  \"Of course this has been no secret to us for some years but he did manage to make O2!\" his Monty Python co-star Eric Idle said Friday on Twitter, referring to the group's reunion performances in London in 2014.  Formed in 1969, Monty Python also included Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman, who died in 1989. Jones directed some of the troupe's best-known films, including \"The Meaning of Life,\" \"Life of Brian\" and \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\"  \"We are very much looking forward to celebrating the work of Terry Jones during the ceremony with a look back at his work from 1969 to the present day,\" said Hannah Raybould, director of BAFTA Cymru.  Jones' representative said of the award, \"Terry is proud and honoured to be recognised in this way and is looking forward to the celebrations.\"",

        "article": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — It took just nine fateful minutes for a valet stand dispute to escalate to a deadly Las Vegas Strip shooting, crash and fireball.  Nearly every second was captured by video, audio and witness accounts and detailed in a Las Vegas police report made public after a weeklong manhunt led to the arrest of Ammar Harris in Los Angeles on Thursday.  Investigators say Harris, a 26-year-old felon and self-described pimp, exchanged angry words with aspiring rapper Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr. in a casino valet area.  The shouting continued as the two men drove in separate cars along Las Vegas Boulevard, with tires squealing and a horn blaring.  Police say it wasn't long before Harris began shooting, Cherry was mortally wounded, and his Maserati careened into a taxi that exploded in a fireball. In the end, Cherry and two other people were dead, and five others were injured in a spectacular, multi-vehicle crash at one of the most famous neon-lit crossroads in Las Vegas.  Stunned tourists compared the carnage to a Hollywood action film.  The report said it was 4:11 a.m. Feb. 21 when Harris stood for a moment in the valet area of the glossy and glassy Aria resort, talking with Cherry, who was in the driver's seat of the dark gray Maserati.  \"What was said specifically, I can't say,\" Las Vegas police Capt. Chris Jones said Friday. \"But it's clear there was an exchange of words and a dispute that led to this senseless act.\"  Police found no gun in the Maserati and no evidence that Cherry had returned fire in the attack that ended just before 4:20 a.m. The SUV disappeared along Las Vegas Boulevard as cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, of Las Vegas, and passenger Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Washington state perished in the taxi.  A passenger in the Maserati, Freddy Walters, 26, was shot in the arm, and four people in four other vehicles were hurt, none seriously, in the chain-reaction crashes.  Attempts to reach Walters have not been successful. Police say he cooperated with investigators.  Cherry, 27, was buried Thursday in Oakland, Calif., about the same time Harris was arrested, said Vicki Greco, a Las Vegas lawyer representing Cherry's parents and family.  Boldon and Sutton-Wasmund were mourned by friends and family members who were shocked by what Boldon's younger brother called the \"I don't give a care attitude\" of the crime.  Sutton-Wasmund, a two-time breast cancer survivor, will be remembered at a funeral Saturday in Maple Valley, Wash., as a tireless catalyst for causes, activities and events in her school and business community, said Sue VanRuff, a friend and executive director of the Greater Maple Valley Black Diamond Chamber of Commerce.  \"Many people don't know Sandi for one thing. They know Sandi for lots of things,\" VanRuff said. \"If she didn't know you, she made it her mission to know you. To be your friend.\"  Boldon's funeral was Wednesday in Las Vegas. Taxi drivers held several memorials, including a procession up Las Vegas Boulevard late Thursday with horns honking and hazard lights flashing.  \"My brother was affected by a random, senseless act caused by machismo — a pimp or a tough guy trying to prove he was brazen and bad enough to shoot someone on the Las Vegas Strip,\" Tehran Boldon said. He hailed the arrest of Harris and said he intends to be in court for every appearance by the suspect.  Harris remained jailed Friday in Los Angeles and is due for an extradition hearing Monday. In Las Vegas, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters that he'll consider seeking the death penalty.  \"I can't imagine anything much more serious than firing a weapon from a moving vehicle into another moving vehicle on a corner such as Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo,\" Wolfson said. \"That is reckless, it disregards human life. There were other people injured. It could have been worse.\"  The incident unfolded after Cherry and Walters arrived at the Aria just before 4 a.m. Cherry used the name Kenny Clutch in a YouTube music video that shows scenes of hotels along the Strip as he sings about paying $120,000 for his Maserati and a single mistake changing lives in one night.  The two men went into the casino for about three minutes then returned to the car. After Cherry and Harris talked, the Maserati drove away.  Harris and others had spent several hours at a table he reserved at the nightclub Haze, where Morocco-born rapper French Montana performed.  As the Maserati headed toward Las Vegas Boulevard, Harris climbed into the driver's seat of his black Range Rover SUV with three women inside and followed, wheels squealing as the SUV caught up with the sports car on the Strip.  At a stop light, the Range Rover pulled next to the Maserati and the taxi driver told police the two drivers exchanged words.  A horn sounded as the Range Rover pulled into the path of the Maserati on the boulevard in front of the famous Bellagio fountains, then close alongside.  Police say Harris leaned across the front-seat passenger in his SUV and fired one gunshot into the driver's side of the Maserati. The taxi video shows the cars jockeying into several positions approaching Flamingo Road as two other shots are fired, then three more.  The intersection was soon filled with flames and crashed cars.  The SUV was found two days later at an apartment complex near the Strip, triggering the manhunt. Harris' arrest at an apartment in the Studio City area came about 16 hours after the last of the three women who were with him in the SUV was found by police. She had boarded an eastbound interstate bus on Wednesday in Los Angeles.",

Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan) signed by a dozen pols including Public Advocate Letitia James and Reps. Carolyn Maloney, Jerrold Nadler, and Nydia Velazquez. “We are concerned, however, about the impact that such increases in parking rates will have on NYCHA’s most vulnerable residents – namely, elderly, disabled, or very low income tenants.”  NYCHA announced the proposal to increase parking rates as part of a broader plan to shore up the financial future of the cash-strapped housing authority. In neighborhoods where market rates for parking are the highest, resident rate would go up to a max of $150 a month.  The elected officials proposed instead charging on a sliding scale based on income, age, disability, and where a resident works.  “Other low income residents rely on cars to reach jobs in “transit deserts,” which are difficult or impossible to reach via mass transit. Many of these residents would not be able to pay the proposed fee increases,” they wrote.  \"NYCHA will be reviewing the letter. Increasing revenue from parking is an important part of NextGeneration NYCHA, our 10-year strategic plan to solve the Authority's fiscal challenges and preserve public housing for generations to come,\" said NYCHA spokesman Thomas Ngo. \"NYCHA will continue to provide residents with first priority for parking spots and phase in the parking rate increase through the end of 2017.\"",

Florida's football loyalties are more divided than those of any other state.  We know all of this because Twitter released on Wednesday an interactive map that breaks down National Football League fandom by team and county. It's fascinating to play around with — which you can do right here.  The map, embedded below, gives us a look at where NFL teams' Twitter followers come from geographically, as well as which teams dominate fan loyalty in which counties. You can also isolate data by county or team.  If you want to see how popular one team is nationwide, simply select that team from the \"All Teams\" bar; you'll see breakdowns for how popular your favorite squad is, county by county. The bar below that lets you compare two teams. You can also select a specific county to see which teams are most popular there.  There are infinite ways to slice and dice the data, but be warned: It can get become addictive. Before you play around with the map, read our takeaways following the embedded viewer.  Looking at the far left of the map, we can see the San Francisco 49ers rule most of California. Way down south, the San Diego Chargers win the popularity battle in San Diego, Riverside and Imperial counties, while the Dallas Cowboys rule nearby San Bernardino County. But all of California's remaining 54 counties are 49er territory. That's good news for the 49ers, bad news for the Chargers and worse news for the Oakland Raiders, who don't win one California county — not even the one in which they play.  Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks dominate Washington — to be expected, especially after they beat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in February. But what's the deal with Jefferson County? It sits smack in the middle of Seahawks territory, yet 31% of people in the county who follow at least one NFL team root for the Broncos. Just 22% cheer on the Seahawks.  Befitting their nickname, America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys draw fans from across the United States. The darker a county is shaded, the more followers the Cowboys have there:  Finally, here's how the New York Giants and New York Jets compare when it comes to national appeal:  We've shown you how this interactive map works, so take the reins yourself, and go have some nerdy sports fun.",

        "article": "You can measure a winter in many ways: temperature records, snow cover, even travel delays. But to truly see how frigid this winter has been—at least for the eastern half of the U.S.—you need to go way up. Satellite imagery shows that an incredible 88% of the Great Lakes—Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario and Erie—are now frozen over. That’s the largest ice cover the Great Lakes have experienced since 1994, and it means that there is an astounding 82,940 sq. miles (214,814 sq. km) of ice covering the biggest collection of fresh water in the world.  How unusual is this? Since 1973, the average maximum ice cover extent for the Great Lakes has been just 50%, and in those four decades, the ice extent has surpassed 80% just five times. (In 2002, just 9.5% of the Great Lakes froze over during the winter, the lowest extent on record, while the greatest extent was 94.7% in 1979.) And no lake is as iced over as Superior, where the extent is 95.3%.  (MORE: Window on Infinity: Winter Pictures from Icy Space  The unusually large extent of ice is due to a logical factor: it’s been really, really cold around the Great Lakes. In the Midwest this January, temperatures averaged 5 to 10 F (3 to 6 C) below the 20th century average. But the endless snowfall around the Great Lakes region—Chicago, which borders Lake Michigan, experienced its third-snowiest January on record, and Detroit had its snowiest month ever—played a role as well, insulating the ice cover when temperatures would rise. If you’re wondering why Lake Ontario has such a smaller amount of its surface covered in ice, that’s because the lake is unusually deep, which gives it a tremendous heat storage capacity.  But numbers can only tell you so much. TIME editor Jonathan Woods has stitched together imagery provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab and taken from NASA’s TERRA and AQUA satellites, using data gathered by the MODIS system (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The time lapse imagery shows a truly stunning Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes from September—when all five were open—to now, when ice covers the vast majority of the lakes. You’ll notice how early the freeze began, with ice reported in the bays and harbors of the Great Lakes as early as the end of November, as opposed to the usual time of mid-December. From that early build—due to cold temperatures in the fall and early winter in the Great Lakes—the ice just continued to grow.  For all that, 2014 could well be an aberration. Satellite data shows a generally downward trend in Great Lakes ice cover from 1972 to the present, thanks largely to the general increase in winter temperatures over the same time period. The winter of 2014 will go down in the record books—and there’s no clearer evidence of that than the image of the Great Lakes, sheathed in ice. But we may not see too many repeat performances in a warmer future.  (MORE: The Not So Sustainable Sochi Winter Olympics)",

        "article": "The Lions and Texans both get a litmus test at the midway mark, the Eagles and Cowboys duke it out for supremacy in the NFC East, and the Saints take that struggling offense down to the Superdome, where many offensive ills go to get cured. Let’s make our Week 8 picks.  Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford has the most fourth-quarter game-winning drives since 2011 with 22. Who is second with 19? (Answer below the picks.)  Though he has struggled immensely at times this year, Marcus Mariota is a beast in the red zone. The second-year player has 24 touchdown passes and zero interceptions over his entire career inside the 20. I expect him and the Titans to bounce back from a tough loss against the Colts. These prime-time games haven’t been pretty. The way this season’s been, it’ll be Jaguars-Titans that ends up being the beauty.  The pick: Titans 31, Jaguars 27  It’s tough to pick this game without knowing the full status of Josh Norman, Trent Williams, Brandon Scherff and Jordan Reed on the Washington side. The injury rash has stung the Redskins hard, and I can’t imagine a trans-continental flight is going to help heal any of those bodies. But I like Washington, anyway. Chris Thompson and Jamison Crowder are weapons I don’t think the Redskins brass even knew it had, and Vernon Davis and Will Blackmon are playing the best football of their careers. I’ll ride with the Skins, injuries or not.  The pick: Redskins 24, Bengals 20  For a fleeting moment, I convinced myself the Bills would steal this one up in Western New York, sweep the Patriots this season and have a pair of pocket aces over the chip leader at the season’s midway point. I just can’t do it. Not bold enough. Not brave enough. The Bills had me — they had me good — as winners of four straight. But the Dolphins gashed them on the ground last weekend in Miami, and Ryan Tannehill had a more than competent day in the passing game. Brady and Co. are on a heater right now. They’re not busting. POKER!  The pick: Patriots 26, Bills 20  I asked my NFL Network co-host Kyle Brandt who he’d rather see start for the Jets — Ryan Fitzpatrick or Bryce Petty — and he responded, “Just give me the asteroid.” It’s the feeling a lot of Jets fans have, but if you look at the schedule the next few weeks, they could be primed for a little run. New York faces Cleveland, Miami twice, the Rams, the Colts and the 49ers in six of their next seven weeks. Fitzpatrick is the guy on Sunday, and I think he gets a W — regardless of whether things are lovey-dovey with the coaching staff and front office.  The pick: Jets 21, Browns 16  This is my favorite game of the weekend. The Lions are coming off three straight wins at home, and Matthew Stafford is enjoying a nice little “Hey, wait a second, this guy is pretty good” discovery week from the national media. The Texans, meanwhile, are being written off by the same folks, who have seen them lose just one too many games against good teams. Houston is a bear to play at home, and if you want to look at it on paper the Texans' three losses came in Minnesota, New England and Denver. Not exactly sewer-dweller teams. Detroit could be without cornerback Darius Slay, which means Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins could finally have a day. But I can’t pick against my man Stafford. I’ve got the Lions finding a way and Osweiler having another rough week of questions thereafter.  The pick: Lions 27, Texans 23  The Chiefs are a different team at home and on the road, and I actually like the Colts in this one despite the wise guys in Vegas listing Indianapolis as home underdogs. The AFC South is the butt of many a joke, but this one’s going to come down to the very wire. And it’s a game like this — out of division, at home, against a likely playoff contender — that Andrew Luck and Co. need to win. They’ll be getting some key pieces back, and there’s a feeling that ground can be gained with Houston’s rough outing Monday night in Denver. I’ll go Indy.  The pick: Colts 31, Chiefs 24  Weird things can happen on Halloween in New Orleans. But if there’s ever been a place the Seattle offense can cure its ills, it’s down on the Superdome carpet in the Big Easy against that New Orleans D. Jimmy Graham used to own this building, and I think it might be just what he needs Sunday. I like Seattle. The quarterback breathes a little easier, the kicker kicks a little straighter, and the points come a little more smoothly.  The pick: Seahawks 31, Saints 23  My upset special. Yes, in a battle of two pirate-based mascots, I like the red-hot Bucs to defend their home turf and notch a ‘W.’ Tampa Bay is quietly back to .500 and getting huge offensive numbers out of Jacquizz Rodgers and Mike Evans. I saw something I liked last week. Down 14-0 after a quarter, Tampa Bay didn’t fall apart and crawl in a hole. The Bucs scratched their way back and won with ease. Oakland is a beast on the road under Jack Del Rio, but I think it hits a speed bump Sunday. The pick: Buccaneers 30, Raiders 20  Once upon a time, this was the marquee matchup of the NFL season’s first half. Now, it’s been moved from the 4 p.m. ET window in advance of a Cubs-Indians World Series game. Whatever went wrong with the Panthers this season wasn’t likely fixed over the bye. Whatever went wrong with the Cardinals on Sunday night — only six points to show for more than 450 yards of offense — is probably more correctable. It won’t be pretty, but I think Arizona wins on the road in a game of “What happened here?”  The pick: Cardinals 27, Panthers 23  San Diego is the most entertaining team in the NFL and maybe my favorite 3-4 squad ever. All the Chargers do is play in high-scoring shootouts, own the Red Zone late window and lose players to horrendous ACL injuries. And yet, every week, they deliver. It’s one thing to beat the Broncos in San Diego. It’s another to take them down in Denver, where they’re nasty. It doesn’t matter. I like the Bolts to notch another one. Somehow, some way.  The pick: Chargers 24, Broncos 19  This one will have monster eyeballs leading into FOX’s World Series crush. And that means it’s a game in which Matt Ryan will have the nation’s attention. After glowing reports — for the second consecutive year — a quarter of the way through the season, the Falcons have lost two straight and are suddenly back to the pack. The Packers, meanwhile, are 4-2 but being viewed as if they’re a broken lemon of a car, unable to drive long distances. This one features two of the NFL’s top quarterbacks; no excuse for a dud. I’m taking Atlanta to silence some critics and to get some national love. Keep an eye on Vic Beasley, the second-year pass rusher who’s in line to win some sort of Most Improved award this season.  The pick: Falcons 34, Packers 27  This is a beauty. Plenty of attention on both rookie quarterbacks and the question looming of whether Tony Romo will return to the lineup when he’s cleared to go. I can’t pick against the Cowboys until I have reason to believe anyone can stop their ground game. Ezekiel Elliott is gashing everyone, and the offensive line has had its way. I see it rolling right through this game.  The pick: Cowboys 26, Eagles 17  Fly the W? I’m sorry. Hard to get too fired up for the Bears with all the great things happening in Chicago for the baseball team this week. Chicago’s football squad has been stung hard by injuries, and though the effort’s been there week in and week out, the results have not. Minnesota has been winning with sound offensive football, limited mistakes on special teams and a punishing defense. The first two facets failed them in Philadelphia last week. They won’t in this one.  The pick: Vikings 20, Bears 14  Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo is second on the list with 19.",

        "article": "Last Saturday, Barack Obama gained the second jewel in his foreign policy triple crown: the Paris climate accord. It follows his Iran nuclear deal and awaits but the closing of Guantanamo to complete his glittering legacy.  To be sure, Obama will not be submitting the climate agreement for Senate ratification. It would have no chance of passing — as with the Iranian nuclear deal, also never submitted for the Senate ratification Obama knew he’d never get. And if he does close Guantanamo, it will be in defiance of overwhelming bipartisan congressional opposition.  Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays.  You see, visionary thinkers like Obama cannot be bound by normal constitutional strictures. Indeed, the very unpopularity of his most cherished diplomatic goals is proof of their prophetic farsightedness.  Yet the climate deal brought back from Paris by Secretary of State John Kerry turns out to be no deal at all. It is, instead, a series of carbon-reducing promises made individually and unilaterally by the world’s nations.  No enforcement, no sanctions, nothing legally binding. No matter, explained Kerry on “Fox News Sunday”: “This mandatory reporting requirement . . . is a serious form of enforcement, if you will, of compliance, but there is no penalty for it, obviously.”  If you think that’s gibberish, you’re not alone. Retired NASA scientist James Hansen, America’s leading carbon abolitionist, indelicately called the whole deal “bulls---.”  The great Paris achievement is supposed to be global “transparency.” But what can that possibly amount to when you can’t even trust the reporting? Three months ago, the world’s greatest carbon emitter, China, admitted to having underreported its burning of coal by 14 percent (later recalculated to 17 percent ), a staggering error (assuming it wasn’t a deliberate deception) equal to the entire coal consumption of Germany.  I’m a climate-change agnostic. But I’m realistic enough to welcome prudent hedging against a possible worst-case scenario. I’ve long advocated for a multilateral agreement (unilateral U.S. actions being climatically useless and economically suicidal) negotiated with the most important players — say, India, China and the European Union — containing real limits, real numbers and real enforcement. That would be a genuine achievement.  What the climate-change conference produced instead was hot air, applauded by 196 well-fed participants. (Fourteen nights in Paris, after all.) China promises to begin reducing carbon emissions 15 years from now. India announced it will be tripling its coal-fired electricity capacity by 2030. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is effectively dismantling America’s entire coal industry.  Looking for guidance on how the U.S. will fare under this new environmental regime? Take a glance at Obama’s other great triumph, the Iran nuclear accord.  Does the American public know that the Iranian parliament has never approved it? And that the Iranian president has never signed it? Iran is not legally bound to anything . As the State Department freely admitted (in a letter to Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) of the House Intelligence Committee), the deal “is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document.” But don’t worry. Its success “will depend not on whether it is legally binding or signed, but rather on the extensive verification measures” and our “capacity to reimpose — and ramp up — our sanctions if Iran does not meet its commitments.”  And how is that going?  On Nov. 21, Iran conducted its second test of a nuclear-capable ballistic missile in direct contravention of two U.N. Security Council prohibitions, including one that incorporates the current nuclear agreement — which bans such tests for eight years.  Our response? After Iran’s first illegal launch in October, the administration did nothing. A few words at the United Nations. Weren’t we repeatedly assured that any Iranian violation would be met with vigorous action? No worry, again. As U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power told a congressional hearing last week, “discussions are a form of U.N. action.”  It was obvious from the very beginning that the whole administration promise of “snapback” sanctions was a farce. The Iranians knew it. Hence their contempt for even the prospect of American pushback: two illegal missile launches conducted ostentatiously even before sanctions are lifted and before they receive their $150 billion in unfrozen assets early next year.  Why not? They know Obama will ignore, downplay and explain away any violation, lest it jeopardize his transformative foreign policy legacy.  It’s a legacy of fictional agreements. The proliferators and the polluters are not bound. By our own volition, we are.  Only Guantanamo remains. Within a month, one-sixth of the remaining prisoners will be released. Obama will not be denied.  Read more from Charles Krauthammer’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.",

        "article": "Housing prices continue to tumble, making their way to their 2009 trough and reinforcing the idea that a double-dip in home prices is inevitable, according to the most recent data from the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. The National Index is within a percentage point of the 2009 trough and 11 of the 20 cities surveyed hitting new index lows, as the statistics reveal an increasingly deteriorating housing market.  Annual Returns of the Case-Shiller Home Price Indices - S&P Indices  The release of December’s data shows that the fourth quarter was brutal for the housing market. The U.S. National Home Price Index declined 3.9% through the quarter and was down 4.1% from December 2009, marking the second lowest annual growth rate since the third quarter of 2009, when prices were falling at an annual rate of 8.6% amidst a market in free fall. As of the fourth quarter of 2010, “average home prices across the United States are at similar levels to what they were in the first quarter of 2003,” read the report.  Along with negative housing data, investors had to face continuing social unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, with Libya’s long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi clinging to power as people take the streets and face the security forces. All three major U.S. indices were in the red in early trading in New York, with the Nasdaq leading the way down, falling 1.3% to 2,798 points by 11:10 AM. The S&P 500 was down 0.9% to 1,331 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average faced a fall of 0.6% to 12,315.  Avoiding the term “double-dip,” the index’s chairman David Blitzer noted that “despite improvements in the overall economy, housing continues to drift lower and weaker.” Having warned of the danger of the term in last month’s report, but noting that the market would indeed “double-dip” before spring, Blitzer explained that “unlike the 2006 to 2009 period when all cities saw prices move together, we see some differing stories around the country.” For example, while California (Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco) is doing better, the Sun Belt (Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, and Tampa) continued to work its way down, making new lows in December. (Read Home Prices Double-Dipping Before Spring, Says Case-Shiller Index).  The 10-City and 20-City Composite Indices posted annual rates of decline of 1.2% and 2.4% respectively, as 13 of the 20 surveyed cities fell from December and 11 markets hit their lowest levels since the housing market peaked in ’06-’07 amidst the securitization boom and mortgage bubble. Cleveland and Las Vegas have joined Detroit in seeing their average home prices fall below their January 2000 levels.  Washington DC was the only bright spot, gaining 0.3% from November and 4.1% from December 2009. (Read Price Stability In 75% Of U.S. Metro Areas By Year-End, Double-Dip Looms).  Housing markets still have to digest the inflow of more and more homes stuck in the foreclosure process. Banks and financial institutions were forced to freeze foreclosures as reports of dubious processes and faulty protocol surfaced. This has generated a large stock of unsold homes that will continue to enter the market, which will add additional downward pressure on prices. While Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s program of quantitative easing has generated a “wealth effect” in equities, it has yet to prop up the beleaguered housing market, which is seen as necessary to support a sustainable economic recovery. (Read Bernanke To Rep. Paul Ryan: QE2 Created 600,000 Jobs).  A double-dip in home prices is over the horizon and on its way. Yale economist Robert Shiller, who created the index along with Karl Case, noted in an interview with CNBC that “price[s] may go down substantially,” and, according to Trade The News, estimated that the decline could be in the 15% to 25% range.

        "article": "Georgia has seen major demographic shifts in recent years, with significant increases in African-American, Hispanic and Asian-American populations. The politics of Georgia, however, with gun control debates and harsh immigration laws, seem to lag behind the people.  Downtown Douglasville; I-85 in Atlanta; State Representative B.J. Pak at his daughter's school in Gwinnett County. Photographs by Luke Sharrett  Downtown Douglasville; State Representative B.J. Pak at his daughter's school in Gwinnett County; I-85 in Atlanta. Photographs by Luke Sharrett  Downtown Douglasville Photograph by Luke Sharrett  LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. — A gated community of regal brick homes with impeccable landscaping and $450,000 price tags might seem an unlikely place for a voter-registration drive. The neighborhood, with its swimming pool and tennis courts, evokes stability and a sense of having arrived.  But when Maria Palacios, 24, a part-time canvasser for a Latino rights advocacy group, knocked on doors on a sweltering summer afternoon, she was greeted by those who had never cast ballots, immigrants like herself — newcomers from Korea, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Mexico, all faces of a changing Georgia.  “There are a lot of people here from Mexico like us,” said Hector Velazco, an information technology consultant, telling Ms. Palacios that he and his wife are awaiting naturalization so they can vote. “It’s not only workers to mow the grass.”  This is the new Georgia, a state whose transformed economy has spawned a population boom and demographic shifts that are slowly altering its politics. With African-Americans coming in large numbers from other states, and emerging immigrant communities like this one in Lawrenceville, Georgia is less white and less rural than it was a decade ago.  Yet for all the changes and what they may portend, Georgia’s politics — including a closely watched Senate race between the Democrat Michelle Nunn and the Republican David Perdue — are today playing out largely on the familiar terrain of black and white.  Black Democrats have long held power in Atlanta, but in the state legislature Republicans — who are nearly all white — outnumber Democrats two to one. Political debates center on issues like curbing illegal immigration and expanding gun rights. And many of Georgia’s new immigrants do not or cannot vote. If Democrats are to win statewide in November, they must increase turnout among minorities, especially blacks, and bring back moderate whites, especially women.  “Georgia is a conservative state — it was a conservative state when the Democrats were in control,” said Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican who has been in public office nearly 40 years. “That Georgia is all of a sudden changing to be a different state, I think, is a myth. Georgia is continuing to be what it has been, which is a growth state with a diverse economy and a diverse population.”  Democrats, though, see a different future. “Georgia is next in line as a battleground state,” said Jason Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor (and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter). “People may disagree about whether it’s red or blue. But everybody agrees that it’s changing.”  In 1980, Georgia was what Mathew Hauer, a demographer at the University of Georgia, calls “a black-and-white state.” Whites were 72 percent of the population and blacks, 26 percent. Now, Georgia’s population has more than doubled, to nearly 10 million. By last year, the state was 55 percent white, 31 percent black, 9 percent Latino (up from 1 percent in 1980) and nearly 4 percent Asian.  The growth has shifted the population north, to the counties that ring Atlanta, like Gwinnett, a pocket of multiculturalism, where Lawrenceville is the county seat. In nearby Duluth, business leaders embrace diversity as “an asset” in attracting international companies, said Joe Allen, who runs a public-private partnership to promote economic development.  “Our motto is: ‘A world of places in one place,’ ” Mr. Allen said.  On Gwinnett’s main thoroughfare, Pleasant Hill Road, a giant Asian market, Assi Plaza, occupies a former Walmart; on Saturday mornings, it bustles with shoppers, picking over lychee, Korean melon and 10 varieties of shrimp, as tilapia swim in a tank. Honor boxes carry four different Korean-language newspapers.  Down the road at the Santa Fe Mall, a former outlet center converted into a Hispanic market, retailers sell bright-colored cowboy boots and frilly quinceañera gowns. A Spanish-language radio station broadcasts from here; its Mexican-born general manager, Franco Vera, moved to Georgia from Chicago.  “I love Georgia,” Mr. Vera declared. Asked why, he searched for words to convey its energy and growth. “It’s the boom!”  That boom has its roots in what Rajeev Dhawan, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University, calls “the three Ts” — transportation, tourism and telecommunications — industries that he said were “turbocharged” in the 1990s and still drive the state’s economy, somewhat more slowly, today.  KEY White Black Hispanic Asian — Colors indicate the largest group in each census tract. Circles are scaled by population size, and color saturation indicates the prevalence of the largest group.  Those industries were hit hard by the dot-com bust and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and home construction — which kept Georgia humming through the early 2000s — was crippled by the recession. Unemployment is now 7.8 percent, the second highest in the nation, behind Mississippi. Yet after a slow recovery, economists say, Georgia is bouncing back; the state added 83,400 jobs last year.  Georgia’s universities — including its historically black colleges — have helped draw newcomers from out of state, nourishing Atlanta’s thriving black professional and political class. “We call it the black Mecca,” said Rodney Sampson, a founder of Opportunity Hub, where minority- and women-owned companies share office space.  As Democrats and their allies work furiously to register new voters, Republicans, aware that their future hinges on broadening their base beyond whites, have hired a minority engagement director, Leo Smith. He recently helped students at historically black Morehouse College restart a Republican club. He views his work as “a long-term investment.”  Traveling the state in this midterm election season, it is possible to see the pull and tug over which way Georgia will go. Its population may be shifting faster than its politics.  “Demographically, Georgia is changing,” said State Representative B.J. Pak, a Korean-born lawyer, Gwinnett County Republican and the sole Asian-American in the legislature. “Politically, it’s changing. But not as fast as people think.”  Dot Padgett, 87, and a lifelong Democrat, stepped onto the front porch of her century-old home in the Atlanta suburb of Douglasville, carrying sweet tea in tall glasses and sugar wafers on a silver tray. She sat down in a white painted rocker to talk about how her native Georgia has changed.  In 1976, Mrs. Padgett helped lead the volunteer “Peanut Brigade” that ushered Jimmy Carter to the White House, then worked in Washington as his deputy chief of protocol. That was when Georgia was solidly Democratic, before whites and conservatives, alarmed at what they saw as the party’s liberal tilt on cultural issues, fled to the Republican Party.  Mrs. Padgett never left. She calls herself “a Democrat who will vote Republican,” in the mold of Zell Miller, the former governor and senator who backed George W. Bush for president. “He really told the truth as much as anybody,” she said, “about how the Democratic Party had drifted from what it was.”  So when Mr. Perdue and Mr. Isakson came to a little plaza in downtown Douglasville, Mrs. Padgett dashed over to give the senator a quick peck on the cheek, but slipped out before Mr. Perdue arrived. She backs Ms. Nunn — partly out of loyalty to Ms. Nunn’s father, Sam, a centrist Democrat who served in the Senate from 1973 to 1997. “I think there’s a little conservative streak in her also,” Mrs. Padgett said.  Dot Padgett, 87, said she has seen a shift in Douglas County’s population over the years.  As to whether she voted for President Obama, she leaned back in her rocker, arched her eyebrows and reiterated her own words.  “I am a Democrat,” she said coyly, “who will vote Republican.”  Douglasville and its surrounding county, Douglas, are part of the housing boom that has remade the metro region. Two decades ago, downtown Douglasville was surrounded by farmland.  Today commercial parks dot the landscape, home to companies like Subaru and Google, which built a data center here in 2003, adding 350 jobs. A firm tied to Tyler Perry, the black actor and filmmaker whose studios are in Atlanta, has bought 1,300 acres of land. New housing developments, well-tended communities with names like Tributary and Palmer Falls, are filled with young black professionals.  Douglas County’s black population rose more than 200 percent from 2000 to 2010; its Democratic Party is experiencing a revival. More than a decade ago, white Republicans held all five seats on the County Commission; today there are three white Republicans and two black Democrats. Mitt Romney won Georgia in 2012 with 53 percent of the vote, but Mr. Obama won Douglas County.  Among the newcomers is Dalia Racine, an African-American prosecutor running for county district attorney. She was born in New York, attended high school in Virginia, college in Florida, law school in Atlanta. She and her husband moved to Douglasville, in search of a bigger home in which to raise a family, when they discovered they were having twins.  A friend recently hosted a house party for her; a diverse, though mostly African-American, crowd attended, nibbling on wrap sandwiches, sweets and fruit.  “Highly qualified, professional candidates like myself — we’re able to throw our hats in the ring right now,” Ms. Racine said. “The voters are aware of it. The media’s aware of it. Republicans are aware of it.”  A marble obelisk with a soldier on top — a monument to Confederate veterans — greets visitors to Waycross, on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. If Atlanta, four hours north, is the new Georgia, Waycross is steeped in the old.  On a recent morning, a small crowd of several dozen Democratic enthusiasts, mostly blacks, gathered in an old railway depot, where their Senate nominee, Ms. Nunn, was to speak. Among the first in line was Johnny Lee Roper, 77, who serves on the City Council in nearby Douglas, dressed in olive green suit, suspenders and black straw hat.  “All us people of color believe that Michelle is going to be our liberator,” he said.  Ms. Nunn’s appearance in this city of roughly 14,000 people was a reminder that she needs every black vote she can get — and of how race still governs politics in much of Georgia. The handful of whites in the crowd included a woman who gave her name only as Glenda; she did not want her Republican neighbors to learn she was there.  She is worried about the economy, she said; she gave up her job as a medical office manager when her mother was ill and gets by cleaning houses. A campaign worker asked her to take a lawn sign; she resisted. As a Democrat, she said, “I’m shunned enough.”  The newspaper in Waycross, The Journal-Herald, has been in the family of Jack Williams III, its current editor, for a century, ever since his grandfather bought it. The first Jack Williams was a staunch Democrat and member of the Georgia legislature; his grandson is a conservative Republican.  Seated at his paper-strewn wooden desk, Mr. Williams echoed Republicans across Georgia. He is worried about the rising federal debt, angry over the Obama administration’s failure to secure “our porous border to the south” and feels that a vote for Ms. Nunn would be a vote to keep Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, in power.  “I think the Democrats are taking us the wrong way,” Mr. Williams said, “and most of my readers — with the exception of my black readers — feel that way.”  On the wall of her cluttered office across the street from the state capitol, Stacey Y. Abrams, the Democratic leader of the Georgia House, keeps two giant maps of Georgia’s legislative districts. In each district held by a Democrat, she has posted a tiny black-and-white photo of the lawmaker.  There are 180 districts, but just 60 photos, most clustered around Atlanta. All told, not counting a black Republican recently defeated in a primary, there are 51 minorities in the Goergia House; 49 are Democrats.  “Our caucus is 80 percent African-American; the Republican caucus is 98 percent white,” she said. “That’s not a sustainable model.”  A Yale Law School graduate and part-time romance novelist, Ms. Abrams — the first African-American party leader in the Georgia House and the first female leader in either chamber — wants to change that. The New Georgia Project, which she founded, is working to register minorities, 18-to-29-year-olds and unmarried women, groups she estimates make up 62 percent of the state’s voting-age population.  The effort, though officially nonpartisan, is controversial; Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican, is investigating the project, alleging fraud; project leaders accuse Mr. Kemp of voter suppression and a “witch hunt.”  Conservatives dominate policy making in Georgia. Same-sex marriage is banned and the state was among the first to require voters to present photo identification. Georgia has one of the nation’s strictest immigration laws, modeled after Arizona’s bill allowing law enforcement to ask about immigration status. This year, Georgia greatly expanded gun rights.  Yet there are hints that the conversation in Georgia is taking on a different tone.  Immigration rights advocates have taken heart in the words of State Senator Tommie Williams, a tree farmer and former member of the Republican leadership, who favors passing a state version of the Dream Act to help young people brought here illegally by their parents gain a path to legal residency.  State Representative B.J. Pak, a Korean-born lawyer and Gwinnett County Republican, is the only Asian-American in the legislature.  And Representative Pak, the Korean-American Republican — who voted with his party on the Arizona-style immigration bill — helped block a measure to require English-only drivers’ tests. He says Republicans can succeed in embracing immigrants, and prides himself on broadening their perspective.  “We were at a caucus meeting, and nobody was raising this issue about how this will impact first-generation immigrants,” Mr. Pak said of the English-only bill. “And afterward, a lot of the caucus members were like, ‘You know what? I didn’t even really think about that I’m glad you said that.’ And I was able to put an amendment on that killed the bill.”  Latinos in Georgia, as in much of the country, are the fastest growing minority.  “The Latino vote continues to grow,” Jerry Gonzalez declared, over lunch at a Caribbean restaurant in Lawrenceville. “It’s grown from 10,000 in 2003 to well over 220,000 right now — that’s estimated. There’s over 80,000 Latinos that are eligible, not yet registered.” An estimated 600,000 eligible blacks are also unregistered. “So what we are doing today,” he said, “is really important.”  CreditStephen Morton for The New York Times  Mr. Gonzalez, a founder of the nonpartisan Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, was giving a pep talk to Ms. Palacios and about a dozen other mostly young canvassers. His group is running voter registration drives each weekend, and is heavily focused on Gwinnett.  Its aim, beyond bolstering Latino voting power, is to build support for a bipartisan immigration overhaul, stalled in Washington. For Ms. Palacios, that is personal.  Her parents, as California migrant workers, brought her to the United States illegally when she was 2 months old; the family later settled in Georgia, where many Latinos work in poultry processing plants. When she graduated from high school, Ms. Palacios applied to college; lacking papers, she was required to pay out of-state tuition. So she followed her parents’ path, weighing chicken tenders on an assembly line.  Eventually she returned to Mexico, paid the United States government a fine and came back to Georgia legally. Today she is a senior and debate champion at the University of North Georgia who dreams of becoming an immigration rights lawyer and seeking public office. “Had I been born here,” she said, “I’d be looking to run for president.”  But Ms. Palacios is not yet a citizen. And so, like many new Georgians, there is one thing she still cannot do: vote.

        "article": "The trip of a lifetime to celebrate a Scottish woman’s 60th birthday turned brutal when two supposedly tame cheetahs attacked the woman at a game reserve in South Africa.  Violet D’Mello and her husband Archie were allowed to get up close and pet two brother cheetahs, Mark and Monty, at the Kragga Kamma Game Park in Port Elizabeth last weekend.  “They seemed to be pretty docile. They said they were hand reared from cubs and were extremely tame and one could you know stroke them and not only that lay on them and they’ll do nothing to you,” Archie D’Mello said.  The couple had just taken photos with the animals and were still in the petting area when one of the cats grabbed an 8-year-old girl by the leg.  Violet D’Mello tried to stop the attack. After the girl ran for safety, D’Mello said both cheetahs turned on her in a savage attack that lasted for more than three minutes.  Incredibly, Archie D’Mello kept taking pictures, documenting the horrific scene as the animals bit and scratched his wife’s head, legs and stomach.  Violet D’Mello said her instinct took over while a guide tried to pull the cats off of her.  “Something inside me just said, ‘Don’t move. Don’t move at all. Don’t react, just play dead’,” she told the  Miraculously, Violet D’Mello walked away with no life-threatening wounds.

It’s obviously very unfortunate, and we’re looking into what may have startled or riled up the cheetahs,” Cantor said.

        "article": "The deal just didn’t seem to make much sense.  That was the conventional wisdom in January 2009, when KPS Capital Partners announced that it would acquire certain assets of luxury home-goods maker Waterford Wedgwood. For starters, the global capital markets were in shambles, with massive solvency questions surrounding the banks upon which private equity firms like KPS relied. For its part, Waterford Wedgwood was arguably in worse shape, hemorrhaging around $100 million annually.  “We’ve been doing professional turnarounds for 25 years, but this was certainly the most shattered business we had ever encountered,” explains Michael Psaros, co-founder and managing partner of KPS. “No one else wanted to buy it so, if we hadn’t stepped in, it was going to be liquidated.”  Six years later, the brave bet has proven the skeptics wrong and paid off handsomely for KPS and its investors. The private equity firm announced that it has agreed to sell the parent company it created, WWRD Holdings, to Finnish consumer products company Fiskars for $437 million. That would seem to work out to more than a 4x return for KPS, based on the original purchase price and $66 million in dividends that KPS received over the years (KPS is not disclosing exact ROI figures, nor do we know what it paid to add Slovenia’s Rogaška in 2013).  “What we knew was that it had four legendary and iconic brands, including selling product in 80 countries,” Psaros says. “Waterford is a household name in the U.S. but, globally, Wedgwood is magic. If we could figure out how to design and make the products profitably, then we could really do something.”  The first step was hiring Pierre de Villemejane as CEO, based on his success helping turn around prior KPS portfolio company Speedline Technologies (acquired by Illinois Tool Works). KPS and de Villemejane would quickly realize that each of WWRD’s four “iconic brands” — Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton and Royal Albert — were essentially running as independent units, with their own manufacturing strategies, marketing plans, etc. They were quickly consolidated, and more streamlined manufacturing and distribution plans were drawn up. KPS only offered jobs to 3,800 of the 6,600 people who had working at Waterford Wedgwood pre-bankruptcy — something Psaros argues is 3,800 jobs saved rather than 2,800 jobs lost — but managed to continue producing the same amount of product. It also began substantial manufacturing outside of England and Ireland.  “What we discovered was that our Wedgwood products manufactured in Indonesia sold just as well as our Wedgwood products manufactured in the UK,” Psaros says. “The only market where there is still some affinity for UK-specific product is Japan.”  Of equal import, new management worked to modernize the product line — turning WWRD into more of a luxury home-goods company rather than a bridal goods company. This was particularly important in the U.S., where fewer engaged couples are ordering bone china patterns or sets of crystal drinking glasses.  By late last year, KPS felt it had done just about all it could. It would eventually hire Goldman Sachs [feortune-stock symbol=”GS”] to run an auction process, with Psaros saying that Fiskars had pole position from the start — as strategic buyers often due when competing against private equity suitors. It ended up agreeing to pay around a 10x multiple on WWRD’s EBITDA.  “It has been the most dramatic turnaround of our careers,” Psaros says. “To us this wasn’t just a deal or investment… it was something we lived for six years, and now believe it’s going to a very good home.”  Get Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals and deal-makers.",

        "article": "Americans have deeply conflicting views about political campaign money. On one hand, it's the functional equivalent of free speech, the opinion increasingly held by federal courts, which have stripped away some of the most important limits on political donations. On the other hand, it's often indistinguishable from legalized bribery, the view held by reformers who have tried for decades to put reasonable limits on the money that goes to candidates.  By Ross D. Franklin, AP  Republican presidential candidates at Wednesday night's debate. From left, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.  By Ross D. Franklin, AP  Republican presidential candidates at Wednesday night's debate. From left, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.  In fact, it is both, and the results aren't pretty. Belated disclosures this week from the supposedly independent \"Super PACs\" that support presidential candidates detail the huge new role that multimillion dollar donors — now free from previous limits — are playing in the campaign.  A stunning $10 million (so far) from Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife helped keep Newt Gingrich's candidacy alive so he could win the South Carolina primary. At least 10 donors gave at least $1 million apiece to Mitt Romney, which helped him buy enough negative ads to squash Gingrich in the Florida primary and keep his own bid alive. Rick Santorum got two $1 million contributions from deep-pocketed supporters, and Ron Paul received $2.6 million from the founder of PayPal. Each candidate effectively has a millionaires' board of directors.  President Obama isn't any purer. He recently signaled that he wants his Super PAC to raise the kind of money he'll need to battle his opponent this fall, and the group supporting him has already collected $2 million from DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. That's the kind of guy whose calls a president takes.  What to do about this destructive bidding war? Some Democrats have proposed amending the Constitution to give Congress the authority to limit campaign money, but the chance of that happening anytime soon is nil. Distant, too, is the preferred solution: a voluntary system of public financing that would give candidates a chance to avoid being beholden to wealthy interests.  Opinions expressed in USA TODAY's editorials are decided by its Editorial Board, a demographically and ideologically diverse group that is separate from USA TODAY's news staff.  Most editorials are accompanied by an opposing view — a unique USA TODAY feature that allows readers to reach conclusions based on both sides of an argument rather than just the Editorial Board's point of view.  The best short-term answer is to provide voters with faster, more prominent information about who's giving what to whom. A revised version of the Disclose Act, a measure that two years ago passed the House and fell just one vote short of passing the Senate, would strengthen disclosure, which the Supreme Court said makes sense as other restrictions fall away. Most usefully, the act would require:  •Super PACs to abandon a leisurely disclosure schedule and report their spending and donors every 24 hours, online. In the Internet age, that's hardly a burden.  •PAC-paid TV ads to disclose the PAC's top five donors, likely through a crawl at the bottom of the screen. The PAC's top official would have to appear at the end of each ad to say he or she approved the message, just as candidates do.  •Shadowy political committees that now hide their donors, by organizing under a special part of the tax code, to disclose their contributors.  •Corporations and unions to tell their stockholders and members how much they spend on political campaigns, and where.  Critics complain that this is onerous and unnecessary. Well, of course they do. And none of it is a magic bullet. But practically speaking, it's the only tool reformers have left for now, and there's no good reason why voters shouldn't have as much information as possible.  It's unclear whether these modest changes will come to a vote this year in either chamber of Congress. As the process unfolds, voters unhappy with the way Super PACs are hijacking the process should pay close attention to who wants to keep them in the dark.  , visit our FAQ's.

Download Buddy Media’s free guide for Successful Retail Social Posting to learn how to drive results with your social postings.  Businesses rely on Facebook to increase brand awareness, build community and strengthen customer service (for starters).  But how can companies effectively leverage Facebook to amplify new product launches? We spoke with some companies — large and small — that used Facebook to effectively introduce products to the marketplace and generate new sales.  To ensure that time spent online is time well spent, businesses must focus on building and cultivating a targeted audience. Start by defining your audience and developing a strategy to attract that demographic to the Facebook Page. A content strategy, social giveaways and Facebook ads can help companies reach the right people.  As sneakpeeq co-founder and president Henry Kim says, “We learned that if you get the right audience to share your product in the beginning — and getting this audience excited about your company is a giant step — you can do this with little money. Be creative. Where else can you get an instant audience for your company?”  A growing Facebook community is also an evolving community. Sheri Wallace, who works with Dandelion, seller of eco-friendly baby products, notes: “The community at 10,000 fans is not the same as it was at 2,000.” She adds that keeping in touch with the parents has been crucial to increased growth and to the success of newly launched products.  As Nike Golf launched a new golf ball during the Master’s Tournament, it offered a select number of limited edition green swoosh 20XI balls to Facebook fans in three time-based giveaways in the days leading up to the tournament. The giveaway occurred several weeks before the 20XI balls were available in retail stores, so the public did not yet have access to the product.  In addition to giving away a small number of golf balls, Nike Golf also offered a free shipping promotional code as a “consolation prize.” According to Brian Carter, digital marketing manager for Nike Golf, the launch doubled interaction rates and led to a significant increase in impressions. Most notably, the revenue generated from the campaign’s promotional code was six times the cost to run the campaign.  In some cases, Facebook can function like a traditional website landing page. Transparent Corp, a software company that exclusively sells its products online, has used Facebook Page tabs to create “condensed and easily sharable versions of the landing pages for new software products,” according to Aaron Smyk, the company’s director of social media and marketing.  Smyk offers the following tips to create effective landing pages within Facebook:  If a business has effectively built a Facebook following that resembles the target market, this network can be a major research and development asset. Ask for feedback, design input and functionality requests. If you’re launching a product with a beta testing period, ask the Facebook community for volunteers.  If the product announcement includes a soft launch targeting specific cities, take advantage of Facebook’s geotargeting tools, including ads and customized status updates.  Facebook ads can be targeted by state, city or zip code. But, don’t stop there. Dig deeper to create a more targeted, cost-efficient, effective campaign. For example, if your product appeals to people who work in a specific industry, research the major players in that space and target the ad to people who work at those companies and live in the city you’re trying to dig into.  But, sneakpeeq’s Kim warns, “Be smart about spending money on Facebook. Do a lot of testing and find out what works. Start small and when you find something that works, keep doing it and on a broader scale.”  In addition to geotargeting ads, posts can be directed toward certain locations. Just click the button underneath the status box to customize who can see the update. The default setting is “public,” but page admins can select a country and then specify states or cities.  In 2009, Little Debbie used the launch of the new Little Debbie Chocolate Cupcakes as a centerpiece of the brand’s entrance into Facebook. The product launch included:  According to David Griner, director of digital content for Luckie & Co., the agency that helped Little Debbie develop and implement these campaigns, Facebook continues to be a major components of their product launch strategy. “With each launch, we feature the new products on Facebook, solicit fan feedback and offer occasional giveaways to encourage sampling. Since the cupcake launch, we’ve doubled the Facebook audience to more than 1 million Likes, thanks largely to giveaways and other promotions that help fans feel engaged with the brand.”  Companies want to get creative with giveaways, but as Kim notes, it’s important to stay true to the brand and use giveaways as a learning opportunity. “Everything we gave away was something we were already selling or planning to sell on sneakpeeq in terms of product/brands. We also used the launch on Facebook to educate consumers about what sneakpeeq is — a social shopping site with a twist.”  What advice can you offer to companies who want to incorporate Facebook into their product launch?

        "article": "In an era of ad-skipping and Web-surfing, prime-time audiences of 25 million and the Friends-style paydays that come with them are largely a memory of television past.  Add today's tight advertising budgets and its no wonder network executives continue to take a hard line on star salaries. Rather than pay a lead as much as $200,000 per episode, as networks have freely done in seasons past, even acclaimed film stars are lucky to walk away with $125,000 to star in a new series today. Plenty of established shows, too, are being hit by cost-cutting measures, be it shortening a show's season or freezing its stars' salaries.  To compensate, many of the genre's leading ladies are parlaying their small-screen appeal into other ventures (and revenue streams). In addition to popular prime-time network shows, several, including Eva Longoria Parker (No. 4), Tina Fey (No. 7) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (No. 10), have bolstered their résumés with everything from film roles, record companies and production projects to perfumes, books and endorsement deals. In fact, these side projects have helped the stars on our list of Prime Time's Top-Earning Women collectively rake in an estimated $162 million between June 1, 2009, and June 1, 2010. Earnings are calculated before taxes, management fees and other costs; voice-only actresses were omitted from the list.  In Pictures: Prime Time's 10 Top-Earning Women  Topping the list is Ellen DeGeneres, who banked an estimated $55 million in the 12-month period by becoming as much brand as she is TV star. Though her stint in prime time as a judge on American Idol was brief, she remains a ratings magnet earlier in the day as host of her popular gabfest, The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Growing her presence--and pocketbook--still more, she has lent her face to ad campaigns for American Express ( AXP - news - people ), CoverGirl and newer entry Vitamin Water. More recently, she announced she was launching her own record label, eleveneleven, and promptly signed 12-year-old YouTube sensation Greyson Chance as her first artist.  At No. 2 on our list is Tyra Banks, who earned an estimated $25 million over the course of the year. Though the host, producer and Bankable chairwoman wrapped her daytime series this spring, she'll continue to produce and host her prime-time creation, America's Next Top Model, which has built a loyal following among younger females around the world. Off camera, the former model serves as a producer on ABC's True Beauty and will soon roll out her first of many books, called Modelland.  Rounding out the top three is former Grey's Anatomy star Katherine Heigl, who raked in an estimated $15.5 million during the same period. Though the famously outspoken actress has garnered critics for her controversial comments, she remains a big draw--and as a result, a big earner--on-screen. In fact, thanks to a string of box office successes like Knocked Up and 27 Dresses, Heigl commands a cool $12 million per film, placing her among the best-paid ladies in Hollywood. (Her more recent star turn opposite Ashton Kutcher in the critically-panned Killers proved a dud.) Up next: Life As We Know It, where she and co-star Josh Duhamel become caregivers to an orphaned girl when their mutual best friends die in an accident.  Still others on our list of the genre's top-earners, including CSI's Marg Helgenberger and Grey's Anatomy's Ellen Pompeo, rely solely on TV income. And while they're not making the $1 million per episode that Jennifer Aniston and her five Friends co-stars made nearly a decade ago, their respective $10 million and $7 million seasonal incomes are hardly worth pitying.

The Small Business Administration is offering small disaster loans to businesses  Bill aims to give crab industry $138 million in disaster relief  California commercial crab fishermen, many struggling to keep their businesses afloat amid an unprecedented season closure caused by a toxic algae bloom, could see more than $130 million in disaster relief under a last-ditch federal proposal to bail them out of financial doom.  Bay Area Reps. Jackie Speier and Jared Huffman introduced the legislation this week, more than three months after commercial crabbing was shuttered by state officials due to dangerous levels of a neurotoxin found in Dungeness and rock crabs caught along the coastline from Santa Barbara County to Oregon.  “We are here today, as you can tell, surrounded by fishermen who aren’t working,” Speier, D-Hillsborough, said at a news conference Friday outside Scoma’s Restaurant on Fisherman’s Wharf. “To lose that money, to lose that income, is devastating.”  Speier’s office estimated that commercial crab fishermen have lost $68 million this season, while related businesses, such as restaurants that depend on selling the seafood delicacy to diners, are down about $70 million.  Last month, the California Department of Public Health green lighted recreational Dungeness crab fishing near San Francisco, Half Moon Bay and Monterey — but commercial crabbing remains dead in the water.  The bill proposed by Speier and Huffman — the Crab Emergency Disaster Assistance Act of 2016 — seeks to appropriate about $138 million in disaster funds to fishermen and small businesses, including restaurants, that were banking on the commercial season. Sen. Barbara Boxer is expected to introduce its companion bill on Monday.  On top of disaster assistance, the legislation would include $1 million for sampling and monitoring of the neurotoxin, domoic acid, which is produced from marine algae blooms. Another $5 million would go toward grants administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for research on the biotoxin and the growing blooms from which it sprouts.  But it may take quite a bit of time before anyone sees the money.  Funds from the legislation are contingent upon a disaster declaration by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, whose office declined to comment Friday on the possibility, and a potentially lengthy appropriations process in the House and Senate.  “This is a Congress that doesn’t do a heckuva lot,” Huffman, D-San Rafael, said. “We’ve got our work cut out for us.”  John Barnett, 50, a fisherman who has caught crabs commercially for 10 years, had to take out loans from his retirement account to do engine work on his boat, The Amigo. But he counts himself among the lucky ones in his hard-hit industry. Fishermen who watched the news conference at the pier said they know crabbers who had to mortgage their homes to make ends meet.  “We’re just waiting,” Barnett said. “We want to go out and fish. No one wants a handout.”  Crustacean fishing for many is the most lucrative time of year. Many of those in California’s $90 million crabbing industry also took a hit last year with a blighted salmon season, and another one may be around the corner.  Fisherman Jim Anderson, 64, who sits on the state Dungeness Crab Task Force, said about 95 percent of his income depends on crabbing. The disaster assistance, he emphasized, would “make us whole — it’s not asking for a windfall.”  The crisis in fisheries and on dinner tables originated in a massive harmful algal bloom that contains an algae named Pseudo-nitzschia. The diatom produces domoic acid, which passes up the food chain and can wreak permanent brain damage on consumers — be they sea lions or humans — an illness called amnesic shellfish poisoning.  Years before the closure of fisheries, Sausalito’s Marine Mammal Center was dealing with the biotoxin in pinnipeds.  The domoic acid cases appear to be on the rise, according to Dr. Cara Field, a veterinarian at the center. In previous years, the algal blooms spiked in the summer and autumn, she said, but it persisted year-round in 2015, leading to an intake of about 235 patients, some of which “don’t remember where to go to be a normal sea lion,” Field said.  Cessation of commercial crabbing cast newfound scrutiny on the rise of harmful algal blooms, which have largely stumped marine scientists. Doctors like Field are hopeful research funds from the bill could help close the knowledge gap.  In the meantime, commercial fishermen are cautiously awaiting a possible go-ahead from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, despite the best part of the season, which begins in November and lasts until June, having come and gone.  Jacky Douglas, 87, who captains the Wacky Jacky and takes people salmon fishing, lamented the closure of crab fisheries.  “It’s their livelihood we’re talking about,” she said. “We’re all part of the ocean brotherhood.”  Kimberly Veklerov is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

(Anders Blomqvist/LPI)  What do GuimarÃ£es in Portugal and Maribor in Slovenia have in common, apart from that most people cannot find them on a map? This year, the pair of cities share the title of European Capital of Culture.  More than 40 towns and cities have held the honour since Athens was named the first European Capital of Culture in 1985. Selected by an international panel of cultural experts, the aim of the title is to bring different European countries closer together by highlighting the diversity of their cultures.  Despite being often overshadowed by Oporto, just 30 minutes to the southwest, it makes sense that this year the committee selected the burgeoning cultural scene of Guimarães in northern Portugal. With around half of its inhabitants under age 30, Guimarães is one of Europe’s youngest cities, both in age and spirit. A boom of contemporary culture in recent years has revived its medieval streetscapes, a World Heritage Site since 2001.  Now the year-long European Capital of Culture program is set to bring even more life to Guimarães. The rich repertoire of events ranges from music, cinema and photography to fine arts, theatre and dance. More importantly, a crop of new openings, sparked and partly financed by the program, is about to give a further boost to the city’s cultural landscape.  Centro Cultural Vila Flor (CCVF) kick-started the city’s cultural revival when it opened in 2005 in a striking modern building added onto a converted 18th-century palace. Events at this culture powerhouse include movie screenings, cafe concerts, theatre and art exhibits. This year, as part of the European Capital of Culture program, CCVF will present the second edition of GUIdance (1 to 11 February), an international dance festival showcasing major contemporary dance companies such as Belgium’s les Ballets C de la B, who are slated to open the festival with the world premiere of their new work, Au-delà.  The Center for Art and Architecture Affairs, unveiled in October 2011 in a former textile factory, is the latest opening in Guimarães. The non-profit collective promotes interaction between various fields of creative expression, including visual arts, design, film, literature, media, performing arts and architecture. Upcoming events on the European Capital of Culture program include a conference focused on the work of John Cage (10 March to 28 April) and Frame Art, a video art and experimental cinema festival (3 May to 8 July).  Plus there is more in the pipeline. Opening in March in a run-down part of town called Couros (named after the area’s once flourishing leather industry) is the Design Institute, a partnership between the municipality, the University of Minho and Portugal’s National Design Association. Its inaugural exhibit, part of the European Capital of Culture program, will focus on product design, specifically the relationship between traditional products and contemporary design.  Another notable opening this year, scheduled for June, is the Platform of Arts and Creativity in a former market, a multipurpose space dedicated to arts and various creative endeavours. It kicks off with an exhibition by Portuguese painter José de Guimarães, with pieces from his private collection of pre-Colombian, African and Chinese art.  The same month will see the opening of the House of Memory, located in an old plastic factory right next door to the Platform. This cultural institution will host an interactive display composed of memory-laden personal items donated by the people of Guimarães. It is designed to tell and preserve the history of the common people, an admirable effort in this world that forgets and changes so quickly.",

The 29-year-old Arab Israeli allegedly attacked the busy city centre location on Friday, at a time of heightened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians following a wave of knife attacks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The suspect, whose name has been withheld by police, is believed to be from Arara in the Wadi Ara area of northern Israel, and has reportedly served time for trying to snatch a soldier’s weapon.  Related: Two people dead in Tel Aviv shooting  He is alleged to have stolen a gun on Friday from his father, a volunteer with the Israeli police. His father contacted police after seeing security footage images, alleged to be of his son, which were screened across Israeli media.  The attacker targeted the Simta pub on Dizengoff Street, a major arterial route in Tel Aviv, killing Alon Bakal, 26, and Shimon Ruimi, 30. Another seven people were injured, two of them seriously.  The suspect’s father urged Israeli security forces to detain his son as soon as possible, fearing he would strike again, according to Israeli media.  “What is important to me now is that they reach my son and arrest him, because he is still armed,” the Ynet news website quoted him as saying. “I am worried and I want to hear that he is in police hands.”  A relative of the suspect told the Haaretz newspaper that he had a history of involvement in violent incidents, and said that in recent years his family had occasionally called the police because of his aggression.  “We know he was being treated for mental [health issues],” the relative claimed. “We haven’t heard much about him recently.

The father was questioned on Friday evening, and computers and items from the family home were reportedly seized as part of the investigation into the attack.

        "article": "“Shooting politics is tough,” says Natalie Keyssar in an email as she waited, on Feb. 1, for Hillary Clinton to appear on a stage in Iowa after results started coming in.  For the past week, Keyssar has been crisscrossing the state of Iowa on assignment for TIME. She’s photographed campaign events of most of the primaries’ leading candidates from Ted Cruz and Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley.  At each event, Keyssar has had to adapt to different situations. “The scenes are limited,” she says. “The media presence is huge. Everyone is looking for a story in situations that are largely very controlled and scripted.”  The young photographer, who is shooting her first presidential campaign, is looking for images that will communicate what she’s been feeling at these events, she says. “It could be the television lights in my eyes, or a moment when the candidate seems to relax their guard for a second.”  Other times it’s just a face in the crowd. “Some look hopeful,” she tells TIME. “Some look angry. But the story here is the Iowan voters.”  And they’re a passionate bunch, Keyssar says. “I’ve been struck by the sincerity that the Iowans approach the whole caucus procedure. When I talk to people they seem to take the responsibility of being Iowan and having a potentially strong impact on this election very seriously.”  For Keyssar, photographing the primaries has been more than just a professional gig–it’s also offered her a chance to see her country’s political process in a new light. “It’s been amazing to get to see what the candidates mean to people here on the ground,” she says. “Why some are gravitating towards Sanders or Hillary or Trump or Cruz; what it means to them personally. Politics are usually pretty abstract and impersonal, so having a chance to see them this way is pretty special.”  Natalie Keyssar is a photographer based in New York. On her last assignment for TIME, she shadowed police officers from West Philadelphia’s District 19.  Paul Moakley and Chelsea Matiash, who edited this photo essay, are respectively TIME’s deputy director of photography and visual enterprise and deputy multimedia editor.

Thanksgiving weekend is the busiest time of year to fly, and that means crowds, delays, long lines and a stressful experience guaranteed to get the weekend off on the wrong foot. But it doesn't have to be that way.  With a little planning, forethought and some realism about what is needed for the trip, every traveler can take steps to make the Thanksgiving travel gauntlet less harrowing, and their holiday weekend a lot more fun.  In Pictures: How To Get Through The Airport Fast  Smart travelers have their own preferred methods of checkpoint expediency. Some have a favorite pair of traveling shoes that slip on and off easily, others have already emptied the contents of their pockets into their carry-on bags. A true sign of the travel ninjas? They keep their ID and passport in a holder around their neck, within handy reach, and don't gum up the works by storing these essential items in different pockets or bags.  Being prepared is the key to getting through security fast. \"Don't think you can just sneak by with a belt on,\" says Sascha Segan, author of Fly Safe, Fly Smart. \"Many delays are caused by people doing things right in front of the machines that they should have done 10 minutes previously.\"  The Transportation Security Administration maintains a list of things you can do to get through the line faster, and their tips--pack your bag in an organized manner, wrap or bind all power cords, place coats or jackets into your bags before the scan--are good ones. But there are other steps the savvy passenger can take to speed the process along even more.  A smart traveler's preparations begin before leaving for the airport. \"Complete your check-in at home, and print your boarding pass,\" says Douglas Stallings, senior editor at Fodor's. \"This is especially important if you aren't checking bags.

Now a free man, he reveals how he was able to influence politicians and their staffers through generous gifts and job offers. He tells Lesley Stahl the reforms instituted in the wake of his scandal have had little effect.  The following is a script of \"The Lobbyist's Playbook\" which aired on Nov. 6, 2011.  Jack Abramoff may be the most notorious and crooked lobbyist of our time. He was at the center of a massive scandal of brazen corruption and influence peddling.  As a Republican lobbyist starting in the mid 1990s, he became a master at showering gifts on lawmakers in return for their votes on legislation and tax breaks favorable to his clients. He was so good at it, he took home $20 million a year.  Jack Abramoff: Inside Capitol corruption How corrupt is lobbying in Washington, DC? Enough to get \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl angry when she hears how Jack Abramoff bribed and influenced legislators.  It all came crashing down five years ago, when Jack Abramoff pled guilty to corrupting public officials, tax evasion and fraud, and served three and a half years in prison.  Today he's a symbol of how money corrupts Washington. In our interview tonight, he opens up his playbook for the first time.  And explains exactly how he used his clients' money to buy powerful friends and influence legislation.  Jack Abramoff: I was so far into it that I couldn't figure out where right and wrong was. I believed that I was among the top moral people in the business. I was totally blinded by what was going on.  Jack Abramoff was a whiz at influencing legislation and one way he did that was to get his clients, like some Indian tribes, to make substantial campaign contributions to select members of Congress.  Abramoff: As I look back it was effective. It certainly helped the people I was trying to help, both the clients and the Republicans at that time.  Lesley Stahl: But even that, you're now saying, was corrupt?  Stahl: Can you quantify how much it costs to corrupt a congressman?  Abramoff: I was actually thinking of writing a book - \"The Idiot's Guide to Buying a Congressman\" - as a way to put this all down. First, I think most congressmen don't feel they're being bought. Most congressmen, I think, can in their own mind justify the system.  Abramoff: --rationalize it and by the way we wanted as lobbyists for them to feel that way.  Abramoff would provide freebies and gifts - looking for favors for his clients in return. He'd lavish certain congressmen and senators with access to private jets and junkets to the world's great golf destinations like St. Andrews in Scotland. Free meals at his own upscale Washington restaurant and access to the best tickets to all the area's sporting events; including two skyboxes at Washington Redskins games.  Abramoff: I spent over a million dollars a year on tickets to sporting events and concerts and what not at all the venues.  Stahl: For the best seats?  Abramoff: The best seats. I had two people on my staff whose virtual full-time job was booking tickets. We were Ticketmaster for these guys.  Stahl: And the congressman or senator could take his favorite people from his district to the game--  Abramoff: The congressman or senator uh, could take two dozen of his favorite people from their district.  Stahl: Was all that legal?",

        "article": "Luke Sharrett for The New York Times  President Obama delivered remarks in the rain at a campaign event at Walkerton Tavern & Gardens in Glen Allen, Va., on Saturday.  CLIFTON, Va. — President Obama barnstormed through this swing state on Saturday as his campaign relentlessly hammered at Mitt Romney’s business record, releasing a mocking new ad that shows Mr. Romney singing “America the Beautiful” as it accuses his former firm of shipping American jobs overseas.  Mr. Obama, speaking first to a drenched crowd during a downpour in the Richmond suburb of Glen Allen, and then at Centreville High School in Fairfax County, accused Mr. Romney of investing in “companies that have been called pioneers in outsourcing.” He ignored Mr. Romney’s demands for an apology about the campaign’s tone, which the Republican candidate had called for in interviews on Friday.  “My opponent and his allies in Congress, they believe in top-down economics,” Mr. Obama said. “If you cut through all the stuff, what they are really saying is tax cuts for the wealthy, roll back regulations. That is essentially their plan.”  The president’s campaign has spent more than a week harping on Mr. Romney’s personal wealth and calling on him to disclose information about his personal finances by releasing more years of his tax returns. It has also raised questions about Mr. Romney’s offshore investments and accounts.  The new ad reminds viewers of those issues as it shows a clip of Mr. Romney singing at a campaign event in Florida this year.  It says Mr. Romney shipped jobs to Mexico, China and India — accusations that Mr. Romney’s campaign vehemently denies. And it says Mr. Romney had “millions” in a Swiss bank account and “tax havens” in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  “Mitt Romney’s not the solution,” the ad states. “He’s the problem.”  On Saturday, the Republican campaign repeated Mr. Romney’s angry comments about what it said are untrue allegations surrounding Mr. Romney’s personal finances.  “As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician: dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent,” said Amanda Hennenberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman.  Mr. Romney’s campaign has repeatedly defended the offshore accounts, saying that he paid all the taxes legally required. On Friday, Mr. Romney again refused to release multiple years of his tax returns. He has released a return for 2010, and an estimate for 2011.  He characterized the Obama campaign’s allegations as “reckless” and “absurd.”  But if Mr. Romney’s campaign hoped that his rival’s campaign would back off its aggressive tone, they were disappointed. Traveling with the president on Air Force One, Mr. Obama’s top aides went out of their way Saturday morning to highlight their continued attacks.  In addition to the television ad, Mr. Obama’s campaign released a Web video compilation of attacks that Mr. Romney has made in the past. The point, aides said, is that Mr. Romney is equally responsible for the campaign’s tone.  “Mitt Romney, I just want to remind you, is the same candidate who questioned whether the president understood America, questioned whether he understood freedom,” said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. “He spends a lot of time attacking.”  The video, titled “Asking for Apologies While Launching Attacks,” shows Mr. Romney raising the issue of Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and shows him accusing the president of “appeasement” in his foreign policy.  “This president spends a lot of time apologizing for America,” the video shows Mr. Romney saying. “He should be apologizing to America.”  The video concludes by saying: “Mitt Romney. He sure asks for a lot of apologies. When he’s not busy launching attacks.”  Throughout most of his speech on Saturday, his second day in Virginia, Mr. Obama avoided the down-and-dirty political combat that has consumed much of the campaign coverage.  “Even though the crisis put us through some very tough times, the American people are tougher,” Mr. Obama said. “Folks may have gotten knocked down some, but they got back up.”  But the second half of Mr. Obama’s stump speech is tougher. He accused Republicans of giving tax breaks to companies that send work overseas. And he quoted Mr. Romney as “saying let Detroit go bankrupt,” the headline on an article he wrote in The New York Times arguing for a managed bankruptcy for the auto industry.  He concluded with a fiery defense of his health care bill.  “The Supreme Court has spoken. It is the law of the land. We are going to implement it,” he said. “It was the right thing to do. We’re not going backwards, we are going forward.”",

        "article": "DETROIT (AP)  Detroit's mayor said Thursday that he fired the city's police chief after he was \"blindsided\" by his role in two reality television shows and his romantic relationship with a fellow police officer.  Mayor Dave Bing's comments came a day after he fired Chief Warren Evans — one year after he was hired for the job.  On his Facebook page, Evans, 61, lashed out at critics, saying he didn't understand the problem with a video promoting a reality show in which he would star.  \"I don't get the big fuss! It's a producers product,\" he said in the Facebook post. \"If the City doesn't like it there won't be a series Period! Does someone want to believe the streets aren't like that? LOL\"  Bing acknowledged for the first time Thursday that the promotional video was a factor in his decision to fire Evans. The video for a proposed reality show called \"The Chief\" includes footage of Evans posing with an assault rifle outside a vacant city train station, patrolling and making arrests.  Bing had banned reality TV cameras from following officers after a 7-year-old girl was killed during a police raid in May, though the promotional video appears to have been shot over the winter.  In the botched May raid, a special response team was searching for a man wanted in an earlier killing. It was documented by a camera crew for A&E's reality television show \"The First 48.\" Bing didn't know Evans had approved a contract with the show, which had followed Detroit police and homicide investigators for several months.  Bing, who initially declined to elaborate on his reasons for firing the chief on Wednesday, said Thursday that along with the promotional video and \"The First 48\" contract, Evans' relationship with Lt. Monique Patterson also led him to fire the chief. Evans has been public about their relationship, and police have no policy against officers dating each other.  \"We know the tease, the A&E, there were personnel issues, all of that,\" Bing said during an impromptu news conference.  \"It wasn't easy. It was my choice. I don't just get rid of people,\" Bing said. \"I was upset, No. 1, because of being blindsided by it.\"  The Associated Press left messages for Evans seeking comment.  On his Facebook page, he also addressed his relationship with Patterson, who appears with Evans in the profile photo of his page.  \"It's a shame when its problematic for two single adults to date,\" Evans said in a Facebook posting. \"Shame on me for not hiding it! Or being married with a girlfriend on the job like so many others.\"  Among the grounds Bing cited for firing Evans, the relationship with Patterson presents the most serious concerns, said University of Michigan ethicist John R. Chamberlin.  When the chief dates a lieutenant, \"anyone between them in the chain of command is implicated,\" said Chamberlin, a professor of public policy and director of the Center for Ethics in Public Life.  Evans should have talked with Bing about the issue and tried to work out a solution, such as transferring Patterson to duties outside the police command structure, Chamberlin said.  The last thing the chief should have done was to set up Detroit for more bad publicity, Chamberlin said.  \"We don't need one more thing that's going to be on the front page,\" he said.  Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police, had a different view, saying an officer shouldn't be faulted for a personal matter that isn't covered by department policy.  \"If you don't have any rules, how do you know you're stepping out of line?\" asked Rinchich, safety director at the University of Charleston in West Virginia.

        "article": "Robin Williams was beloved by the U.S. military, perhaps even more so than by the American public. He carried Bob Hope’s mantle as a funny man far from home, often in inhospitable places. Throughout his career, Williams made six USO tours to Iraq, Afghanistan, and 11 other countries and performed for 90,000 troops by the time of his final tour in 2010.  He had the troops roaring in Baghdad in 2003, shortly after the capture of Saddam Hussein. “I love the fact that when he came out of that spider hole, he wanted to negotiate,” Williams said, before changing his voice into that of a bellowing soldier: “It’s a little late for that, bubsy! You’re at the point where you’re going to share a cell with a large man named Bubba. I’m gonna be yo’ new Baghdaddy.”  He also poked fun at the Army itself, including a change to uniforms that appeared to be computer-generated. “The new Army camouflage—it’s digital,” he told troops in Kabul in 2007. “So you can disappear in front of a computer.”  “Williams traveled around the world to lift the spirits of our troops and their families,” the USO posted on Facebook following the news of Williams’ passing. “He will always be a part of our USO family and will be sorely missed.” The post had attracted nearly 60,000 “likes” by midday Tuesday.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made a statement of his own on Williams, saying that “from entertaining thousands of service men and women in war zones, to his philanthropy that helped veterans struggling with hidden wounds of war, he was a loyal and compassionate advocate for all who serve this nation in uniform. “He will be dearly missed by the men and women of DOD—so many of whom were personally touched by his humor and generosity.”  Jim Garamone, a writer for the Pentagon’s internal news service, wrote Tuesday of the comedian’s caring and compassion for those fighting the nation’s wars:  At the end of every performance—be it a combat outpost or a forward operating base—Robin was always the last entertainer to leave. In Iraq, a group of Marines came in from patrol and missed his show. He made it a point to meet with them and give them 20 minutes of fun, even as the chopper’s blades were turning to go to the next show.

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon’s top spokesman, recalled asking Williams, the father of three, for some fatherly guidance during that last 2010 tour. “I once asked Robin Williams to offer advice for my son, who would soon turn 18,” Kirby tweeted early Tuesday. “’Follow your heart,’ he said. ‘The head is sometimes wrong.'”",

        "article": "IMAGINE if Texas lawmakers, in a bid to protect mom-and-pop bookstores, barred Amazon.com from shipping into the state. Or if Massachusetts legislators, worried about Boston’s shoe boutiques, prohibited residents from ordering from Zappos.com.  Such moves would infuriate consumers. They might also breach the Constitution’s commerce clause, which limits states from erecting trade barriers against one another. But wine consumers, producers and retailers face such restrictions daily.  Last month, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, introduced a bill in the House that would allow states to cement such protectionist laws. It should appall wine snobs, beer swillers and even teetotalers. In this case, the law would protect not small stores and liquor producers, but the wholesale liquor lobby.  Like virtually all of America’s liquor laws, this proposal traces its origins to the temperance movement. When Prohibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, states were given the authority to regulate the “transportation or importation” of “intoxicating liquors” within their borders.  States were allowed to decide whether they wanted to remain dry. As alcohol again started flowing freely, states either assumed control over its sale and distribution, or created a wholesale tier to sit between producers and retailers.  Before Prohibition, many bars were owned by brewers or distillers. Temperance advocates blamed these bars for some of the ills associated with drunkenness, and believed that keeping the producers away from the business of selling directly would help society.  Lawmakers hoped this wholesale tier would weaken producers. And indeed, the wholesaling industry grew quickly, as most alcoholic beverages had to pass through it before ending up at liquor stores, bars and restaurants. It was, essentially, a state-mandated middleman.  Today, wholesaling is big business. Together, the nation’s two largest wholesalers — Southern Wine & Spirits and Republic National Distributing Company — have revenues of about $13 billion.  A chunk of that cash is funneled to lawmakers. The National Beer Wholesalers Association maintains the nation’s third-largest political action committee, and since 2000, it has donated $15.4 million to candidates for federal office — about $5 million more than the A.F.L.-C.I.O donated in that time.  In the past decade, it spent $5.6 million on lobbying Congress; the Wine and Spirit Wholesalers of America spent $9.3 million.  The expenditures make sense. The wholesaling industry’s survival depends on maintaining today’s highly regulated system. It is estimated that because of wholesalers, consumers pay 18 percent to 25 percent more at retail than they otherwise would.  And in recent years, the industry’s dominance has been threatened.  Last year, the United States passed France as the world’s largest wine-consuming nation (in bottles, not yet per capita). America’s love affair with wine deepened in the early 1990s, when many people developed a preference for high-end wines and started ordering directly from producers.  Wholesalers didn’t like being cut from these transactions, so they pushed state lawmakers to prohibit “direct shipping.” Many did. By 1999, just 19 states allowed consumers to order wine from out-of-state producers.  But in 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in Granholm v. Heald that the 21st Amendment “did not give states the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods.” Thus, lawmakers could prohibit out-of-state wineries from shipping into a state only if they were willing to block their own wineries from shipping out.  In the six years since, several states have liberalized their wine laws. But many restrictions remain.  Alabama oenophiles can order wine only from an out-of-state producer if they have received written approval from the state’s Beverage Control Board. Wineries can ship into Indiana and Delaware only to consumers who have visited the winery and made a purchase in person. In 37 states, residents are prohibited from ordering wine from online retailers or auction houses or even joining wine-of-the-month clubs.  The bill under consideration in Congress will make things even worse.  This proposal would allow discrimination against out-of-state producers and retailers if lawmakers can prove that such laws advance “a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.”  That means that if a state’s discriminatory liquor laws produce tax revenues, for instance, they can’t be challenged in court.  But instead of burdening consumers by foisting more restrictions on alcohol sales, lawmakers should free the market and expand consumer choice by scrapping this bill and letting wholesalers know that it won’t be considered again, as the commerce clause reigns supreme.  Nationwide, there are more than 6,000 wineries, and about 7,000 American wine retailers have Web sites. Wine clubs affiliated with newspapers (including this one), gourmet stores and even rock bands are taking off. Yet most Americans have access to only a small fraction of what’s available.  The wholesaling industry is right to be nervous. After all, consumers have shown that they will order directly from producers and specialty retail shops if given the chance. But that’s no reason to save an antiquated system that gives Americans fewer choices and makes them pay more.  David White is the founder and editor of the wine blog Terroirist.",

        "article": "During Hurricane Sandy, the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island absorbed a critical part of the storm surge. Its hills and waterways spared nearby neighborhoods like Travis, Bulls Head, New Springville and Arden Heights much worse flooding. The 2,200-acre site, which closed a decade ago and is being turned into a park, was also temporarily reopened as a transfer station, helping officials and relief agencies clear debris from around the city.  If many New Yorkers, Staten Islanders included, still can’t help thinking of the place as a mountain range of stinking trash, that’s understandable. But since its closing, Fresh Kills has become a model for landfill reclamation around the world, having been transformed into a vast green space full of wildlife. Now it is also demonstrating the role of wetland buffers in battling rising waters.  Maybe this will help push officials to ready what is known as Freshkills Park for visitors. James Corner, the landscape architect who helped design the High Line and heads the firm Field Operations, won a competition years ago to transform the site and imagined a decades-long, evolving earthwork of different grasses, grown, cut and replanted, creating a rich new soil and landscape.  It’s a visionary plan. But regulatory and financial hurdles, along with the usual bureaucratic conflicts, have stalled progress. The state environmental agency wants to make sure the site is safe, which makes sense. At the same time, the price tag — by some estimates, hundreds of millions of dollars — has clearly daunted city leaders and led officials to pursue a piecemeal transformation that could undo Mr. Corner’s concept.  Considering the unconscionable $4 billion (or more) that is being squandered on a new PATH station at the World Trade Center site for perhaps 50,000 commuters, the cost of Fresh Kills doesn’t sound quite so crazy. Now there’s word that the Metropolitan Transit Authority may need to spend $600 million to restore the South Ferry subway station, which opened just in 2009 and was flooded by the storm. It’s hard to say which is more scandalous, that the authority’s planners hadn’t anticipated flooding at a station on the water’s edge, or that subway fare increases will partly go to pay for their shortsightedness.  By comparison, Fresh Kills has come out smelling like roses.  I recently paid a visit and shot a video of the site with my colleague David Frank and Eloise Hirsh, administrator of Freshkills Park for the New York City Parks Department. No wonder Mr. Corner discovered such potential in what has become a timely research post for climate change and ecological restoration. Once it is opened to the public, the park also promises to repay long-suffering Staten Island residents who endured generations of stench and anger, and more than that, to give the entire city an immense, bucolic urban playland — a 21st-century postindustrial landmark rising from mounds of 20th-century waste.  Who knows? In its shift from blight to boon, it could become a park as unexpected and transformative for the city as the High Line.  Follow Michael Kimmelman on Twitter, @kimmelman.",

        "article": "Cloud computing, where companies sell shared access to software or computing power that can be used over the Internet, is changing the way businesses work.  Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box Inc., a provider of online storage and collaboration tools that allow employees to access and share files from any device, sat down with The Wall Street Journal’s global technology editor, Jonathan Krim, to discuss what this shift means.  MR. KRIM: You have said the market for cloud services is still young. But it seems already to be hyper-coalescing around two or three players. Is that where you see it going?  MR. LEVIE: Amazon got into the space first, and they have this amazing sort of competitive advantage because they see all of the new developer problems before anybody else does. But when you actually look at the public cloud market relative to the entire computing space, it’s still a very, very small portion of total spending. So yes, we are seeing who some of the names might be, but when you’re looking out five or 10 years from now, the space is going to look very different in terms of who’s taking the lead.  MR. KRIM: Let’s imagine that Microsoft , Google and maybe Amazon are your cloud options. Why can’t they provide the services that you provide?  MR. LEVIE: There was a really good article in TechCrunch a few weeks ago called “The Stack Fallacy,” and it was about why it’s so hard for companies to move up the stack, [into a different layer of the market,] in terms of their technology products.  When you move up the stack, you tend to be dealing with a very different set of customers, and people, and individuals using your products. And so, if you’re building infrastructure, large-scale data centers and large-scale computing environments, that’s a very, very different problem than building business applications.  MR. KRIM: But isn’t that what Google has done with Docs and Sheets, and those things?  MR. LEVIE: In terms of end-user productivity tools, absolutely. But in terms of actual systems that are going to work across an entire enterprise to help you manage, share, store, collaborate around, add workflow to all of your data—we think that’s just a very different problem.  We live in a world that is going to be incredibly heterogeneous. There are going to be a lot of different kinds of systems. And as the world gets more heterogeneous, you actually need different platforms in different parts of the stack to be agnostic to the other kinds of applications that you’re using.  That is largely what our role is at Box. One day you might be using Office, the next day you might be using Google Docs, the next day you might be using Adobe , the next day you might want to access files from Salesforce . You need something that’s going to be able to broker how you do all of that sharing, and all of that organization of your information. We sort of live in between the infrastructure world and the SaaS [software as a service] world.  MR. KRIM: We asked the CIOs here if, as they migrate applications to the cloud, they see themselves using multiple vendors for various applications or going with a more integrated solution. Overwhelmingly they said multiple vendors. What do you say?  MR. LEVIE: In the cloud model, you no longer have the technological reason to require products to come from the same vendor. Assuming you have at least a federated security model, a federated analytics and identity-management model, the cost of working with multiple vendors has gone down precipitously. And being able to get best-of-breed applications at each layer of the stack is going to drive far more innovation within the IT sector.  Even the biggest tech vendors are recognizing that the world is going to be heterogeneous, and they have to open up to companies that otherwise would be competitors.  Last week, Microsoft opened up Office, so now you can get access to all of your Box files from Office on your iPhone. You can do real-time, collaborative editing with Office online. It’s shocking to say this, but Microsoft has become dramatically more open than Google, just in the past couple of years.",

Sitting on a couch in his spacious office in the Woody Hayes Center, white workout towel draped over his shoulder, Ohio State's head football coach looks beat from 17 consecutive days of visiting, hosting or calling recruits.  Just don't make the mistake of telling him that.  \"I look beat?\" Meyer repeats with a touch of incredulity. \"I'm tired. I feel good, though. Amazing.\"  That's because in two day's time, 25 faxed letters of intent would arrive in the Buckeyes' office, including nine from Rivals.com four- or five-star recruits who committed during the two months since the former Florida coach returned to his home state. Despite a tattoos-for-memorabilia scandal that cost revered coach Jim Tressel his job last spring, an uncharacteristic 6-7 season and an NCAA-mandated 2012 postseason ban, Ohio State landed the nation's fourth-ranked recruiting class Wednesday.  Few coaches could have pulled that off under the same circumstances. Then again, few can show up in a recruit's living room sporting a pair of BCS championship rings and a list of former players who are now NFL stars.  \"Urban Meyer is the best head coach recruiter by far,\" said Rivals.com national analyst Mike Farrell. \"He's relentless, and he doesn't give up.\"  During his six-year run at Florida from 2005-10, Meyer compiled three classes ranked either No. 1 or 2 nationally. His '06 and '07 groups included two future Heisman winners (Tim Tebow and Cam Newton) and a dozen NFL starters, including two, Aaron Hernandez and Brandon Spikes, who will be playing for the New England Patriots in Sunday's Super Bowl. During that time, Meyer developed a reputation as one of the sport's most competitive and energetic recruiters.  It shouldn't have been a surprise, then, that the 47-year-old immediately galvanized Ohio State's 2012 recruiting efforts upon arriving in Columbus. And yet in some ways, it was. Our last images of Meyer as football coach were those of a dispirited, burnt-out guy who \"retired\" from coaching in December 2010 and spoke frequently -- then and now -- of his desire for more work-family balance. How could we be sure the coach who used to manically text recruits while attending the Super Bowl (back when texting recruits was still legal) would be the same guy to hit the recruiting trail this winter?  Any such doubts were quickly removed when a series of elite recruits -- many of whom were previously committed to other schools -- pledged to the Buckeyes in December and January, usually during or shortly after a visit with the new coach.  \"You talk to him for a few minutes and he's got you hooked,\" said four-star defensive tackle Tommy Schutt from Glen Ellyn, Ill., who switched his allegiance from Penn State to Ohio State following a mid-December visit to Columbus. \"You want to go play for him.\"  By Jan. 30, Meyer was still trying to land three more blue-chippers, but had run out of time to woo them (no more in-person contact was permitted prior to Signing Day). \"Now you're down to creative recruiting,\" Meyer said. One prospect, four-star tackle Kyle Dodson, had made it known his brother would play an important role in his decision. \"I'm trying to get to know the brother, but the only way you can do that is through the phone,\" Meyer said.  It must have worked. Dodson, a 6-foot-6, 315-pound Cleveland native, reneged on his Wisconsin commitment to sign with the Buckeyes. \"This one's a HUGE deal,\" Meyer said by phone upon hearing the news midday Wednesday.  \"I love it,\" Meyer said of recruiting. \"Not like, love. It's competition.\"  On Nov. 28, two days after suffering its first loss in eight years to archrival Michigan, Ohio State hired Urban Meyer as its head football coach.  The night before his introductory press conference, Meyer and his wife, Shelley, spent nearly four hours with the man he'd be replacing, interim coach Luke Fickell, and Fickell's wife, Amy. As many fans had hoped, Meyer offered the 38-year-old Fickell a spot on his staff (he would later be named co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach), a potentially awkward situation that's proven the opposite.  \"It wasn't difficult because we're more similar personality-wise than we are different,\" said Fickell. \"It wasn't like I was taking a step back. This place is special to me.\" The former Buckeye defensive lineman would soon become Meyer's most important recruiter, accompanying him on nearly every one of his home visits.  In those first hurried days, Fickell and holdover receivers coach Stan Drayton -- one of Meyer's former Florida assistants who had joined Tressel's staff a year earlier -- brought the new boss up to speed on the state of the Buckeyes' roster. They identified three areas in need of immediate recruiting attention: defensive end, offensive tackle and linebacker.  \"I told Mark [Pantoni, Meyer's director of player personnel], 'Get me [tape of] the best tackles,'\" Meyer said of his first night on the job. \"So we watched the top 10 tackles, the top 10 defensive ends from this part of the country.\"  That Monday and Tuesday night were a blur, as the coaches took turns handing Meyer their phones for introductory conversations with the players they'd spent months recruiting. He leaned on the returning assistants (Fickell, Drayton, defensive line coach Mike Vrabel and since-departed cornerbacks coach Taver Johnson) for background on the players they were already recruiting, many of whom had cooled on Ohio State following Tressel's dismissal.  \"The whole thought process throughout the year was, just stay in the ballgame, build a relationship with these guys, and whenever we get clarity [on who would be the permanent head coach], all we need is that crack to get our foot back through the door,\" said Fickell.  Five-star defensive end Noah Spence was long expected to sign with Penn State, but became the jewel of Ohio State's 2012 class.  The staff also made cold calls to prospects it hadn't previously dealt with. One of the first went to Noah Spence, a five-star defensive end for Bishop McDevitt High in Harrisburg, Pa., who many expected would sign with Penn State before the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal devastated that program in early November. Meyer's staff called despite the fact that Spence had expressed almost no interest in the Buckeyes previously, focusing instead on Maryland and others.  \"You can tell right away from the [first] phone call whether there's interest,\" said Meyer. \"But we didn't know anything about each other. Usually recruiting takes place over a year, year-and-a-half. With Noah Spence, it was a two-week relationship.\"  Head coaches are allowed only one off-campus contact date with a prospect, and Meyer likes to save his for the last two weeks before Signing Day. He made an exception, however, when Spence's father, Greg, indicated the coach might make an impression if he attended Bishop McDevitt's Dec. 16 state championship game. Meyer, Fickell and Vrabel caravanned together that night to Hershey, Pa., where Meyer spoke to Noah afterward and posed for pictures.  \"[The visit] made Noah feel that, hey, we're not just giving you lip service, we really want you to be here,\" Bishop McDevitt coach Jeff Weachter told SI.com. \"If it wouldn't have been for Urban and his efforts, [Spence] probably wouldn't have even went out and visited [Ohio State].\"  Spence took that visit the next day. By weekend's end, he'd committed. Coming on the heels of commitments a week earlier from two top 10 defensive linemen -- Schutt and Canton, Ohio, native Se'Von Pittman (a Michigan State commit) -- Spence, Rivals' top-ranked defensive end and No. 9 overall prospect, immediately became Meyer's signature recruit.  Eight of the 10 players who pledged to Ohio State after Meyer's hiring had previously committed elsewhere. Flipping committed recruits from other schools is an increasingly common practice, but Meyer can come off as particularly aggressive. At least two Big Ten coaches did not take kindly to Meyer snatching a committed player.  \"Jim Tressel and [Michigan State coach] Mark Dantonio would never call or talk to each other's commitments,\" Dantonio's defensive coordinator, Pat Narduzzi, reportedly said at a function this week in Pittman's hometown. On Wednesday, Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema said he reached out to Meyer with \"concerns\" about certain recruiting tactics. \"The situation got rectified,\" Bielema said.  Meyer doesn't see his methods as anything unusual.  \"How can you go recruit a young guy committed to another school?\" Meyer said Wednesday. \"You ask a question: 'Are you interested?' If they say, 'No,' you move on. If they say, 'Yes, very interested,' then you throw that hook out there.\"  That hook proved particularly hard for most players to turn down. Drayton has seen the Meyer effect with his own eyes when joining him for an in-home visit.  \"I could be the recruiter that's spent all this time recruiting that individual, getting to know what makes the kid tick,\" Drayton said. \"All of a sudden I get in a home visit and Urban Meyer gets a comfort level with the kid and the family and [the recruit] lets his hair down and opens himself up completely.  \"When that happens, Urban Meyer's been undefeated in my experience with him.\"  Stefon Diggs, the nation's No. 8 overall recruits, has yet to sign; he lists Ohio State among his finalists.  While Meyer's one-year coaching hiatus remains puzzling to much of the college football world, it didn't seem to faze recruits, who knew his track record well. But they did have other concerns.  Meyer said he usually addressed the NCAA sanctions preemptively before the players even asked.  \"Every kid has a dream, and never once have I heard 'play in a bowl game my freshman year' as their dream,\" Meyer said. \"It's 'have a great collegiate experience, graduate and go to the NFL.' All the penalties in place have no impact on the kids' dream.\"  Meyer said he had not anticipated the bowl ban, which came down Dec. 20, shortly after the initial flurry of commitments. But, \"as long as this makes college football better, I'm behind it,\" Meyer said. \"It has a serious impact on me, on my family, on my players, but ... I was a very vocal proponent before I came here about willful and intended violations need to be dealt with in a very severe manner.\"  He has a more lighthearted response to another \"negative\" he often hears rival recruiters use against him: That his spread offense is detrimental to players' pro aspirations.  \"It's one of the most absurd things I've ever heard,\" Meyer said. \"We had two quarterbacks -- Alex Smith and Tim Tebow -- playing in the [playoffs].\" From Florida's 2008 national championship team alone, four offensive linemen (Maurkice and Mike Pouncey, Maurice Hurt and Marcus Gilbert), four receivers (Louis Murphy, Percy Harvin, Riley Cooper and David Nelson) and a tight end (Hernandez) have gone on to start at the next level.  \"And they say you have to play in a pro style offense to get to the NFL?\" said Meyer. \"When we get done laughing, we say let's get through this, and it doesn't take long.\"  Not everyone was receptive to Meyer's pitch. Five-star offensive tackle Kyle Kalis, a Lakewood, Ohio, native who made a much-publicized switch from Ohio State to Michigan following Tressel's ouster, took Meyer's call but declined to reconsider. So the Buckeyes looked elsewhere for offensive line help.  Besides Spence, Meyer's No. 1 target was 6-8 tackle Taylor Decker, a Vandalia, Ohio, native who had committed to Notre Dame. \"He's a tall, angular tackle,\" said Meyer. \"He's exactly what we wanted.\"  Decker's primary recruiter in South Bend had been running backs coach Tim Hinton. On Jan. 2, Meyer hired two Notre Dame assistants: Hinton and offensive line coach Ed Warriner.  \"Taylor Decker recruited us,\" said Meyer. \"He called me and said, 'I want to be a Buckeye.' Whoa, what are you talking about? ... Then his high school coach called us said, He wants to come to Ohio State.\"  Decker arrived Jan. 14 for a visit and committed the next day.  Then, a couple of days later, along came the linebacker reinforcements: David Perkins (South Bend, Ind.) and Camren Williams (West Roxbury, Mass.), the latter another Penn State defector. The staff's only (thin) connection to Williams was that the player's father, Brent, once played for the New England Patriots, as did Vrabel a decade later.  \"That was a long process,\" said Meyer. \"They came back twice to visit.\" When Meyer had to dismiss two reserve cornerbacks for disciplinary issues, he stepped up his pursuit of Williams' teammate, four-star cornerback Armani Reeves, who wound up choosing the Buckeyes over archrival Michigan.  Meyer said Wednesday that Ohio State still has room for one more signee, presumably Stefon Diggs, a five-star receiver from Olney, Md., who visited Columbus last weekend. He's expected to announce his choice Feb. 10.  Meyer admits he cares where his class finishes in the recruiting services' rankings. Asked if he was pleased with being No. 3 [as of Monday], Meyer said, \"Sure. We want to finish ahead of our rival.\"  Michigan, which assembled its own stellar class under Brady Hoke, finished sixth.  As he dashed around the country in December and January, Meyer watched several Ohio State games from last season he'd loaded on his iPad. He also broadcast one of the Buckeyes' games for ESPN. While he won't know for sure until he sees his players perform this spring, he believes the Buckeyes' mediocre 2011 season was due largely to the \"chaos\" of Tressel's dismissal, Terrelle Pryor's unexpected departure and the NCAA suspensions of several key players.  But he also senses the program that won six straight Big Ten championships from 2005-10 (the last one since vacated) suffered a talent drop-off.  \"The question I have is, do we have that dynamic player on offense?\" said Meyer. \"Where's the Ted Ginns of the world? Were they hiding [last] year? I hope we have those guys. That's a big concern of mine right now.\"  One player he's thrilled with is rising sophomore quarterback Braxton Miller, who served as an ace recruiter when prospects visited campus and whose skill set seems an ideal fit for the up-tempo offense Meyer and coordinator Tom Herman (formerly of Iowa State) plan to install.  But Ohio State will need more than Miller. Meyer didn't shy away from putting true freshmen in key roles at Florida, and if the 2012 class doesn't entirely fill the void, he's got a jumpstart on 2013. Two of the state's top juniors, quarterback Jalin Marshall (Middletown) and defensive back Cameron Burrows (Trotwood) -- both of whom have already garnered five-star designations from Rivals or Scout.com -- have already committed to the Buckeyes.  \"We already know the '13 class. Done,\" said Meyer.  Meyer also said it was around this time last year that he began to miss coaching. \"I was really convinced I was done,\" he said, though few outside of his own home believed him. He speaks fondly of his time with ESPN, and had anyone besides his home-state school come calling he may well have spent this year's Signing Day in a studio, too.  Wife Shelley and son Nate, 13, plan to move up from Florida by March. Spring football awaits shortly thereafter.  \"I feel great. Awesome,\" Meyer said. \"Without getting too deep -- I believe that things don't just happen by luck.

        "article": "Of all the issues you can raise in a political campaign, the dumbest is whether a member of Congress has moved his/her family to Washington.  O.K., possibly not the absolute dumbest. There was that dust-up over whether now-Senator Rand Paul had, as a college student, kidnapped a female friend and forced her to worship “Aqua Buddha.” Although now that I’m thinking about it, I really did enjoy that one.  Right now in Indiana, Senator Richard Lugar is under fire from a Tea Party opponent who claims that Lugar has not actually lived in the state since he first entered the Senate in 1977.  “This scandal is our chance to replace one of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate with a conservative!” said a fund-raising letter for Lugar’s opponent, Richard Mourdock, the state treasurer.  Lugar is actually a pretty conservative guy himself, although he is best known for his work on nuclear disarmament, which does not appear to be a Tea Party priority. The head of the right-wing PAC, Club for Growth, called for Lugar’s defeat the other day in a statement that denounced the senator for, among other things, having supported the bailout of New York City in 1978. I call that nursing a grudge.  Most of the publicity about the race, however, centers on the residency issue. Mourdock recently held a press conference at the house where Lugar has his voting address, and it definitely did seem to be occupied by another family.  “The entire state is his home,” retorted Lugar’s campaign manager. I am taking this to be a version of “So what?”  The senator’s ability to vote from a residence he hasn’t actually lived in for decades was, the campaign said, based on the same principle that allows a member of the military to vote from the last place he or she lived before going off to fight for the country. I’m not sure this is a comparison they’d want to press.  The issue of voting addresses is particularly sensitive in Indiana, where the secretary of state, Charlie White, was recently tossed out of office after being convicted of registering to vote at his former wife’s address while he actually lived with his fiancée. White, who once worked as a family law attorney, said his private life was “complicated,” which I’m sure we’re all prepared to believe.  Indiana is clearly a state with a lot of political excitement. Just recently, its State House voted in favor of drug-testing welfare recipients, which would not be all that remarkable except that the members also voted to drug-test themselves. “We had an amendment I thought was even better requiring drug testing for all corporate welfare recipients,” said Representative Ryan Dvorak, a Democrat from South Bend. That one, unfortunately, failed on a party-line vote.  But about the residency issue. These fights have been going on forever. One of the very first political investigations I ever worked on involved whether or not a veteran congressman maintained a voting address that was actually a Burger King outlet in North Haven, Conn.  Rick Santorum’s political career was built on an upset victory against a Democratic House member who, Santorum claimed, had lost touch with his district and moved his family to the Washington suburbs. When Santorum moved his own family to the Washington suburbs, he claimed that promises he made when he was in the House didn’t count for the Senate.  Then he enrolled the kids, who were being home-schooled, in a cyberschool that billed his old school district in Pennsylvania $38,000 a year.  “My dad’s opponents have criticized him for moving us to Washington so we could be with him more,” complained one of Santorum’s kids in an ad in 2006, shortly before he lost by one of the widest margins in the history of re-election campaigns. This was the same race in which Santorum claimed that his Democratic opponent, Robert Casey, was a “thug” who sent operatives to peep through the windows of the house near Pittsburgh where the senator maintained a voting address.  “Your despicable actions have endangered our children’s safety,” Santorum and his wife wrote to Casey. A Philadelphia Daily News columnist noted that the children in question were probably not in peril since they were, you know, in Virginia the whole time.  While serving in Congress is really, truly, not the same as serving in combat, these residency flaps are generally bogus. If we want a Congress that looks at least minimally like the country at large — including women, men with working wives, and parents of young children — we can’t carp if they want to keep their families within commuting distance.  Unless, of course, you are talking about somebody who got elected in the first place by running on the residency issue. Then carp away. Please.",

The shooting death of Officer Randolph Holder, allegedly by a career criminal, “has thrown into clear perspective the need for substantial reforms in the criminal justice system,” the mayor said.  “When someone gave their life for us as Officer Holder did, they cannot die in vain. Some greater change, some greater good has to come out of it.”  GUNFIRE VICTIM EXPRESSES OUTRAGE OVER ALLEGED COP KILLER  The mayor said the judge who opted to put accused cop-kiiller Tyrone (Peanut) Howard in a drug diversion program instead of jail was constrained by current state law.  The mayor, joined by several other city officials, wants reform that will give judges more leeway in giving bail to low-level offenders and jail to the more dangerous criminals.  Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams agreed.  “We must find ways to take the handcuffs off judges and keep the handcuffs on those who have made up their mind that they’re going to be violent career criminals,” he said.  Currently, judges setting bail can only consider flight risk when setting a figure for freedom. De Blasio wants to change things so a judge can consider if a defendant poses a threat to the public in determining both bail and eligibility to enter a drug program in lieu of jail time.  GOV. CUOMO COMMUTES SENTENCES OF 2 DRUG OFFENDERS  New York, Missouri and Mississippi are the only three states where potential danger is not permitted as a factor to consider, according to City Hall.  Howard, 30, despite a long and sordid criminal past, was allowed into a drug diversion program just five months before Holder was shot to death on Tuesday night.  Howard is charged with murdering the 33-year-old cop, who followed his father and grandfather into law enforcement. He was shot in the head by the suspect in East Harlem, according to authorities.  The mayor reiterated his belief that Howard had no business in the drug diversion program given his vile rap sheet — two dozen arrests beginning when the suspect was 14.  “The judge certainly knew that there was a pattern of criminal offenses,” said de Blasio. “There’s nothing mysterious about this, I would argue in this case there was ample evidence to go in a different path.”  Ten of the slain officer’s colleagues from Police Service Area 5 in East Harlem delivered a large bouquet of flowers Friday to the Far Rockaway home of Randolph Holder Sr.  Local resident Jessica Borss, 34, tied a few balloons to the lamppost outside the Holder home. Her daughter’s pre-K class at Mill Basin Public School is collecting donations for the officer’s family.  “I still do not understand how that guy was allowed out of jail,” she said. “This poor man had so much life ahead of him. It’s tragic.”",

By Jay Blackman and Matthew DeLuca, NBC News  “Hello, hello,” the pilot’s voice crackles over the radio moments after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 went down at San Francisco International on Saturday.  The sequence of radio transmissions from the airport’s tower — which sound strangely calm given the chaos unfolding onboard the shattered plane — capture the immediate response of air traffic controllers and pilots after the flight went down, ripping off the plane’s tail section and mangling the fuselage.  Sources who spoke with NBC News on Saturday said that no distress call was made from the plane before landing.  “214 heavy, emergency vehicles are responding. Emergency vehicles are responding,” comes the response.  “Okay, I cannot...” the pilot starts to say, before his voice becomes incomprehensible.  Immediately, a message went out to other planes requesting that they keep clear of the San Francisco airport’s airspace, as responders sped toward the plane that witnesses said careened across the runway before coming to a stop and catching on fire.  On Sunday, Asiana Airlines announced that the two people killed in the crash were Chinese teenagers Ye Mengtuan and Wang Linjia. More than 180 people were injured in the crash. But in the immediate aftermath, no one knew how many of the 291 passengers and 16 crew members on board the crash had survived.  “Remain clear of the San Francisco air space, contact San Carlos tower,” the tower recordings from liveatc.net show.  “All runways are closed, airport is closed.”  Video recorded from inside a terminal at San Francisco International Airport captures the scene immediately after Flight 214 crashed Saturday.  About a minute after the pilot of the downed plane radioed the tower, another message went out to whoever might be listening in the crippled cockpit to let them know help was coming.  “Asiana 214 heavy, emergency vehicles are responding, we have everyone on their way.”  For the next several minutes, rescue units radio in their positions as they approach the Asiana flight.  “Everybody calm on ground. It’s going to be a while. Just hold your position and do not acknowledge,” comes another transmission after nearly a minute of silence.  Then, another fifty seconds later, a new voice comes across the air, reporting a sign of hope out on the runway strewn with debris.  “Yes, this is United 885. We see people and I think we should – they need immediate attention. They’re alive and they’re walking around.”  “You said, you said people are just walking outside the airplane right now?” came the controller’s response.  “Yes, some people look like they’re struggling,” the pilot said.  Seconds later, it was clear to people on the ground that passengers had indeed climbed out of the crash that eyewitnesses said they initially thought could not possible have any survivors.  “Between the runways there are people right adjacent to the numbers. I can – we can see about two or three people that are moving and, uh, and apparently survived.”",

        "article": "Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders don’t think much of each other. One is a billionaire capitalist builder, the other a democratic socialist who rails against billionaires. Each believes that the other would be a disaster for the country as president. But there is more to their story than that.  The two outsiders have rattled the political establishment. Each has created a movement of passionate supporters who want them to upend the political status quo. And for two men who seemingly couldn’t be more different, their views have sometimes converged in surprising ways — no doubt more than they’d want to admit.  Start with some aspects of their campaigns. Both like to talk about polls.  No poll seems to escape Trump’s attention — good polls, bad polls, scientific polls, unscientific polls. He cites them for proof of his popularity and mercilessly to put down his opponents.  Here’s how Sanders started his opening statement at Thursday’s rowdy debate with Hillary Clinton in Brooklyn: “When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.”  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump complained about the delegate voting process at his Rochester, N.Y., rally on April 10, saying, \"We're supposed to be a democracy.\" (Reuters)  Both denounce super PACs and neither has to spend time asking wealthy people for money, as Clinton must do constantly. Trump is largely self-funding his own campaign, though he does get contributions from individual supporters. Sanders has a grass-roots money machine that has produced a record number of individual contributions, which he says average $27.  Both have grievances about party rules. Trump says the delegate selection process, particularly in states such as Colorado, where voters didn’t cast ballots, is fundamentally unfair — rigged against him. Sanders has a beef about the potential role of superdelegates, those party leaders and elected officials who have automatic slots at the convention and a big majority of whom already are pledged to Clinton.  [Trump’s fight with GOP hierarchy escalates.]  The rules cut both ways, of course. Both Trump and Sanders have been beneficiaries of the quirks of the their party’s regulations. Trump won only about one-third of the popular vote in the South Carolina primary but got all 50 delegates. Meanwhile, Sanders would be much further behind in pledged delegates if Democrats allowed winner-take-all primaries, as Clinton has captured more of the big-state primaries.  Both Trump and Sanders feel under attack — probably for good reason.  Trump believes the national party leadership wants to deny him the nomination, and there’s good evidence of that. Sanders not only sees the party hierarchy favoring Clinton — although Democratic National Committee officials swear they have maintained their neutrality — but also points to corporate leaders as his enemies.  On some policy issues, Sanders and Trump also agree. The most obvious is trade, where they share almost identical positions.  From the start of his campaign Trump has railed against what he says are horrendously bad trade deals that have hurt the country, setting himself at odds with mainstream Republican policy. Many more Democrats agree with Sanders’s opposition to trade agreements. He’s not really out of the mainstream. But his position runs counter to the policies of President Obama and former president Bill Clinton, and he has pushed Hillary Clinton to the left on this during the campaign.  Iraq is another issue on which they have agreed. Sanders has made his opposition to the war and Clinton’s vote for the 2002 congressional measuring authorizing it a central line of demarcation in his campaign — a test of presidential judgment. Trump has gone rogue with the GOP, not only by declaring that the decision to invade was a costly mistake, but also by arguing during a debate earlier this year that then-President George W. Bush lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to justify the 2003 invasion.  Thursday’s Democratic Party debate highlighted two other policy issues where the Sanders and Trump sound alike: the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and this country’s posture with regard to Israel and Palestinians.  [Sanders, Clinton stage acrimonious debate in Brooklyn]  Trump made headlines recently when he spoke to The Washington Post editorial board and questioned whether NATO had become obsolete. He argued that European nations should carry a bigger share of the financial burden. “I do think it’s a different world today, and I don’t think we should be nation-building anymore,” he said. “I think it’s proven not to work, and we have a different country than we did then.”  That’s not a lot different than the position Sanders enunciated many years ago. At Thursday’s debate, CNN’s Dana Bash confronted Sanders with a 1997 quotation in which he said, “It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.”  Bash asked Sanders how he differed from Trump. “You got to ask Trump,” he replied. Noting problems of poverty and crumbling inner cities, he also sounded like a candidate who thinks nation-building should start at home.  “I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to say to our European allies, ‘You know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies,’ ” he said. “You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that.”  Trump raised a ruckus in February when he told MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough that he would be even-handed — “a neutral guy” — when it came to negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.  He was denounced by his rivals and tried to make amends by backpedaling when he spoke to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC ). He has said since that nobody is more pro-Israel than he, but his initial comments continue to raise questions about his true feelings.  On Thursday night, Sanders called himself “100 percent pro-Israel,” but he also criticized Clinton for not speaking about the plight of Palestinians when she recently addressed AIPAC, and he laid out a view that sounded quite similar to Trump’s earlier comments.  “Of course Israel has a right to defend itself,” Sanders said. “But long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role, trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.”  There are obviously profound differences between Trump and Sanders. The senator has called Trump “a pathological liar” and has denounced Trump’s comments about immigration, abortion and other issues. Trump sees Sanders as a wild-eyed leftist who would raise taxes or spend the country into bankruptcy or both. That makes the areas in which they seem to be in agreement one more oddity of this surprising campaign season.  Dan Balz is Chief Correspondent at The Washington Post.

        "article": "For decades, the federal government — not to mention your dentist — has insisted that daily flossing is necessary to prevent cavities and gums so diseased that your teeth fall out.  Turns out, all that flossing may be overrated.  The latest dietary guidelines for Americans, issued by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, quietly dropped any mention of flossing without notice. This week, The Associated Press reported that officials had never researched the effectiveness of regular flossing, as required, before cajoling Americans to do it.  In a statement issued on Tuesday, the American Academy of Periodontology acknowledged that most of the current evidence fell short because researchers had not been able to include enough participants or “examine gum health over a significant amount of time.”  The revelation has caused a stir among guilt-ridden citizens who strive to floss daily but fall short of that lofty goal. Among experts, however, it has been something of an open secret that flossing has not been shown to prevent cavities or severe periodontal disease.  A review of 12 randomized controlled trials published in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2011 found only “very unreliable” evidence that flossing might reduce plaque after one and three months. Researchers could not find any studies on the effectiveness of flossing combined with brushing for cavity prevention.  “It is very surprising that you have two habits, flossing and toothbrushing without fluoride, which are widely believed to prevent cavities and tooth loss, and yet we don’t have the randomized clinical trials to show they are effective,” said Dr. Philippe Hujoel, a professor of oral health sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.  The American Dental Association’s website says flossing “is an essential part of taking care of your teeth and gums.” Last year, Dr. Edmond R. Hewlett, a spokesman for the group and a professor of restorative dentistry at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, “We’re confident that disturbing the bacteria in plaque with brushing and flossing is, indeed, beneficial.”  Actually, that is only half proved: Brushing with fluoride does prevent dental decay. That flossing has the same benefit is a hunch that has never been proved.  If it is any consolation, there is some mediocre evidence that flossing does reduce bloody gums and inflammation known as gingivitis. That Cochrane review found that regular brushers and flossers had less gum bleeding than people who only brushed, although the authors cautioned that the quality of the evidence was “very low.”  Early gingivitis is a long way from severe periodontal disease. Still, some dentists argue that despite a lack of rigorous study, flossing matters if it can reverse initial gum problems.  “Gum inflammation progresses to periodontitis, which is bone loss, so the logic is if we can reduce gingivitis, we’ll reduce the progression to bone loss,” said Dr. Sebastian G. Ciancio, the chairman of the department of periodontology at the University at Buffalo.  Severe periodontal disease may take five to 20 years to develop.  “It’s a very insidious, slow, bone-melting disease,” said Dr. Wayne Aldredge, the president of the American Academy of Periodontology, who practices in Holmdel, N.J.  Even without rigorous evidence that flossing prevents late-stage periodontal disease, Dr. Aldredge urges his patients to floss. Those who quit are “rolling the dice,” he said.  “You don’t know if you’ll develop periodontal disease, and you can find out too late,” he said.  Maybe the evidence that flossing reduces tooth decay or gum disease does not hold up because we are all such poor flossers. Superflossers, like the zealous hygienist at your dentist’s office, aim to “hug the neck of the tooth” and get below the gum line, Dr. Hujoel said.  But we common folk, staring woefully at our bathroom mirrors, tend to lightly give it the once-over.  A review of six trials found that when professionals flossed the teeth of children on school days for almost two years, they saw a 40 percent reduction in the risk of cavities.  So maybe perfect flossing is effective. But scientists would be hard put to find anyone to test that theory.

The man she accused of attacking her, a Syrian national, was sentenced to 140 lashes for having extramarital sex and drinking alcohol. He was not charged with rape.  He claimed that the sex had been consensual and that the woman had gone to the authorities following a row. The man alleged that she had demanded money, and tried to steal his watch and mobile phone.  Related: Dutch woman arrested in Qatar after reporting rape to appear in court  The woman’s mother said she was delighted and relieved that her daughter was coming home. “This is the news I have been waiting for for days,” she told Dutch national broadcaster NOS. “I haven’t slept for nights, but I’m very happy.”  Yvette Burghgraef-van Eechoud, the Dutch ambassador to Qatar who was present in the packed courtroom, told reporters that the embassy would help the woman to leave Qatar.  “We will do everything to get her out of the country as soon as possible to where she wants to go,” Eechoud said.  The envoy added that she expected her to leave Qatar, which will host the football World Cup in 2022, within the next few days. The ambassador added that she had spoken to the woman on Sunday and that “under the circumstances she was doing fine”.  The woman told the authorities on 14 March that she had been attacked following a night out at the Crystal Lounge in the W Doha Hotel, while she was on holiday with a friend.  She said she woke up the next morning in a strange apartment with hazy memories of leaving in a taxi with an Arab man. She believes that her drink was spiked and that she was raped, according to the family’s lawyer, Brian Lokollo.  The authorities responded to her report of rape by arresting her on suspicion of having extramarital sex. Since then, the woman has been in prison waiting for her case to be brought to court. Dutch MPs voiced concern over the weekend that nobody from the Dutch embassy visited her until three weeks after her arrest, according to Lokollo.  Some Dutch media queried her account after it emerged over the weekend that her travelling companion had admitted to working as a prostitute. The woman’s mother confirmed that her daughter had converted to Islam, which the Dutch foreign ministry said was a “complicating factor” in the case.",

A tiny, new microscope has the potential to detect cancer in hard-to-reach areas of the body well before existing technology.  But the 10-15 doctors in the country trained to use the groundbreaking device may not even know what they're looking at, according to study published recently in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.  The microscope, known as the probe-based confocal laser endomicroscope, is just under several millimeters in diameter - so small it can fit inside the bile duct, which connects the liver to the small intestines. The tiny device takes real-time videos of the duct.  Most medical institutions still use earlier probe technology, which tends to be \"hit-or-miss,\" failing to detect 20 percent to 30 percent of bile-duct cancer or other tumors, Dr. Michel Kahaleh of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center said in a statement.  This mini-probe, however, is expected to improve significantly bile-duct-cancer diagnoses due to its size and accuracy.  But the doctors who have begun to use this miraculous technology aren't exactly in agreement over what the microscope’s videos show.  \"When you have a new technology to search for cancer, you always want to make sure that you're speaking the same language while using it,\" Dr. Kahaleh told the Daily News.  To test the interpretation of the videos, Dr. Kahaleh and his research team sent them to six separate specialists at five different medical institutions. The footage was from the examinations of 25 patients with abnormally narrowed bile ducts.  Dr. Kahaleh found that the doctors were in \"poor\" to \"fair\" agreement on what they were actually seeing in the videos and that their diagnoses ranged from cancer to simple inflammation — to a benign condition.  This variability of interpretation “surprised” Dr. Kahaleh. He explained to the News, \"It's not acceptable to have a patient take five different tests and have five different results.”  To address this diagnostic dilemma the researchers around the country using this cutting-edge technology are now meeting regularly to revise and standardize the analysis of the videos.  When this criteria is clarified, it is likely that the “mini-scope” will help doctors catch cancer earlier and know more clearly which bile-duct tumors need to be removed.  \"It's a big operation, and you want to make sure it is necessary,\" Dr. Kahaleh said in a statement. \"If there is any way to prevent surgery that would be a phenomenal advance for patient care.\"",

        "article": "The man who lost his voice was a gentle man who didn’t ask terribly much of life. He lived in a miniature space in a single-room-occupancy residence on the corner of 74th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan, above J. G. Melon, the popular restaurant and bar known for succulent hamburgers. And he was a New York story.  He was a New York story because he didn’t have a lot and yet he gave a lot. And in return he got what New York for all its busyness so often offers those who could use a good dose of it — kindness. The city can be cold and aloof and you can live crunched amid its population and remain lonely and overlooked. You can also be someone unremarkable and be made to feel like Mr. Big Shot.  The name of the man who lost his voice was Bernhardt Wichmann III. Sounds like an old-money name for sure, but any money ever attached to it was no longer visible.  His story revolves around a pair of doormen. In 1994, Jorge Grisales became a night doorman at the Mayfair, an apartment building at 207 East 74th Street. His shift began at midnight, when the city slows down but keeps breathing.  When you are a doorman, you notice things. You especially notice recurring people.  Mr. Grisales became aware of a man who almost nightly ambled past the building. He had a glistening face with a trimmed beard and he sported a big smile. Six-foot-something. As he walked, he would bend down and dutifully scoop up litter, tidying up the neighborhood.  One sweaty summer evening, the smiling man waved at the doorman and paused. Mr. Grisales said, “How are you?” The man clutched scraps of paper. He wrote something down and handed it over. It said: “Hi, my name is Bernhardt but call me Ben. I can’t talk, but I can hear.”  Something instantly clicked between them. There was a delicious spirit about Ben. Two years later, Juan Arias joined the door staff, and Mr. Grisales introduced him to Ben. They, too, clicked. They talked. He wrote. On his notes, he always drew a smiley face.  Over time, the two doormen learned some blurred snippets about Ben Wichmann. That his parents came from Germany to Davenport, Iowa. That he was born in 1932. That he had served in the United States Army and was in the Korean War. That he came to New York and became an architectural draftsman. That, among other things, he worked on closets as well as decks and porches for houses in the Hamptons. That he loved opera and classical music. That he was gay. That he had a sister. That his parents and sister were dead and he had no family.  And that in 1983 he had polyps removed from his larynx, and that he had not been able to speak since. He wasn’t entirely sure why.  They discovered that since 1991, Ben had lived in that tiny third-floor room down the block that cost $10 a day. He had few possessions and eked by on Social Security. In a city where so many have so much, he had practically nothing. Yet it was enough, always enough. And inside him beat a heart bigger than a mountain.  He seemed unrelievedly happy. That happiness bounced off him and settled on others.  People up and down the block came to know Ben. He always petted people’s dogs. Admired the flowers. His cheery presence made East 74th Street brighter than it would have been without him.  “He charmed people,” Mr. Grisales said. “He always smiled. He never complained. He was just wonderful.”  Mr. Arias said: “He had plenty of reasons to be unhappy. But I never saw him unhappy.”  Now and then, he would stop in at J. G. Melon, plant himself at the bar and have a glass of wine and maybe a salad and converse through his written expressions with customers and the staff.  He would bring the doormen coffee and a Spanish newspaper. And they would fall into meandering exchanges — spoken words from the doormen, scribbling from Ben. Oh how they relished one another’s company.  Mr. Grisales was shaky with his English. That was why he worked the midnight shift. Ben tutored him. If Mr. Grisales mispronounced a word, he would write out how to say it, which syllables to emphasize, what words it rhymed with.  Mr. Grisales polished his English and graduated to an earlier shift.  The doormen gave Ben gifts — shirts or shoes, things he needed. So did others on the block. Joan Gralla, a reporter at Newsday who lives near the Mayfair, gave him sweaters, hats, a yellow rain slicker. For years, she got him a ticket to the Metropolitan Opera. He would dress up in his best clothes and have the time of his life. She would tell him the ticket was from her dog, Clementine.  Once, when the seat was exceptional, he wrote that Clementine must have some pull.  “Ben was just magical in bringing out the best in people,” Ms. Gralla said.  Ben had many medical issues. He came to rely on the doormen to make — or cancel — doctor appointments. If something was urgent, he would write out the note to them in red ink.",

        "article": "Updated DEC 30, 2014 5:43a ET  When Sen’Derrick Marks sacked Charlie Whitehurst on the final play of the Jaguars’ Week 16 win over the Tennessee Titans, many marveled at the defensive tackle’s uncanny sense of timing.  A day after the end to their 2014 season, the Jacksonville Jaguars are facing the possibility of having one of the most integral members of their defense unavailable for the start of the 2015 season.  Marks, who led them in sacks and quarterback hurries, was diagnosed Monday with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, an injury suffered in the second quarter of the 23-17 season-ending loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday.  Surgery has not been scheduled yet because Marks said he was told to wait until the swelling went down in his knee before doing so.  Marks' team-leading sack total is 8.5 -- a mark which drew particular significance and noteriety with that game-clinching sack against the Titans as that sack triggered a $600,000 bonus for the sixth-year player out of Auburn. After making the play, Marks popped up and did the \"money\" gesture made famous by Johnny Manziel before teammates began celebrating with him.  \"I've always thought an ACL was the worst injury a football player could have,\" said Marks, who did not get another sack after the bonus clincher. \"But I'm not going to let it get me down.\"  Marks has started every regular-season game for the Jaguars since coming over as a free agent in April 2013 from the Tennessee Titans. His 8.5 sacks this season were more than he had in his previous five years in the NFL combined.  He crumpled to the ground on the back side of a play where Texans running back Alfred Blue scored on a 1-yard run. Marks was able to walk off the field and to the locker room under his own power but never returned to the game.  \"I felt it (the knee) move, and that's when I went down,\" he said. \"I knew as soon it happened that it was something bad. I didn't think it was an ACL.\"  Defensive end Chris Clemons, who was second to Marks in sacks on the Jaguars with eight, tore an ACL in January 2013 during a playoff game as a member of the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie defensive back Aaron Colvin suffered the same injury last January before the Senior Bowl. Clemons was able to return to the Seahawks the following September, while Colvin was activated Nov. 11 and played in the Jaguars' final six games.  \"You've heard of guys having it and guys coming back and playing stronger,\" Marks said. \"So I'm going to stay positive about it.\"  \"It's unfortunate,\" said strong safety Johnathan Cyprien, who wound up leading the Jaguars in tackles in his second pro season. \"You don't want it to happen to a teammate, and definitely not to a friend.\"  Marks' injury was the latest to befall a key member of a team which finished with a 3-13 record, one game worse than in Gus Bradley's first season as head coach. Running back Denard Robinson, wide receiver Allen Robinson, offensive tackle Austin Pasztor, middle linebacker Paul Posluszny and cornerbacks Alan Ball and Will Blackmon all ended the season on injured reserve, while a series of nagging injuries to running back Toby Gerhart limited him to 326 yards rushing.  \"I was just talking to (Marks), and he said, ‘You know I'll be back,' \" said Posluszny, who is 10 weeks removed from surgery on a torn pectoral muscle. \"He's going to fight back and rehab and hopefully we'll have him at some point early next season. But you hate to see that because he had such a great year, and he's playing so well. You just want to see him get out of the year healthy. That's a tough deal for him.\"  Despite Marks' contributions on a defense which recorded 45 sacks, the Jaguars finished 26th out of 32 teams in total defense and 27th against the run.  \"There were times early in the season where it didn't seem like we were jelling,\" he said. \"But I think it came along good. So it can only go up from there.\"  You can follow Ken Hornack on Twitter @HornackFSFla or email him at khornack32176@gmail.com.",

        "article": "You are obviously directly involved in education, judging by the focus of your comment.  However, I must take strong exception to what you are saying for the following reasons:  (1) You state “The trends supported by the right are concerning for our future, as 300 million Americans hope to prepare our kids to be the ones rewarded when competing with a global middle class that will apporach 3 billion in their lifetime”.  I am not sure who you mean exactly by the “right”, since our entire government is actively involved in cheating future generations of a chance for any kind of decent life, much less that of the anomalous “middle class” that is fast disappearing.  The argument of “competing with a global middle class” is a strawman argument to distract the American people from the fact that our main problem with education is our own government.  I have said before in previous comments that there is no economic reason why the US elite should improve our school system when it is much cheaper to simply (a) export jobs to a third world country, or (b) for those jobs that cannot be exported, to import cheap labor from the “global marketplace”.  The solutions to our incredibly poor “educational system” do not lie within the school system as most would have you believe (e.g. poorly trained educators not up to the task), but with the ability of the elite class to shift jobs and labor at will.  There is absolutely NO WAY the US educational system can EVER “compete” with the global labor market.  To give you an example, Walmart employment policies are a good proxy for what is happening to the US economy. They hire at the lowest wage possible, with no benefits and utilize “part-time” labor as much as possible.  THIS “Walmart Model” is where the US educational system is taking us — to a system of low paid workers with an extremely high percentage of “temporary” employees — who would function like “seasonal workers” hired by companies when they need additional labor (e.g. I used to use “Manpower Inc” to fill temporary accounting positions during audit season), then simply let them go after they are no longer needed.  THAT is the IDEAL WORKFORCE for ANY company for jobs that cannot be outsourced overseas — no lengthy job search, health care and benefit packages, vacation issues, or potential problems when an employee doesn’t work out (legal issues) — ALL aspects of hiring employees which cost money (i.e. lost profits) for the company.  THIS is what the free market system is doing to US education, and the American people are apparently too stupid to understand that the ONLY thing companies care about is PROFITS.  WHY, when the entire work is a “temp agency” would they willingly choose to invest in US schools?  (2) You state, The rise of smaller private colleges as student loan mills” to which I agree, and is proof of my accusation, since NONE of these people will EVER get decent-paying jobs and a future as a result of their efforts, but only MASSIVE amounts of student loan debt.  (3) You state “The disincentives for higher education of any type unless you can ‘borrow from your parents’” which is absolutely true, since from an elite point of view, their children are the future leaders of this nation, so why should they deliberately undercut their the future of their children by funding a school system of those who are not “leadership material”?  The huge reduction in school funding for higher education that you see now compared to a few decades ago is literal proof of what I am saying.  (4) You state “The false choices, like having to choose between better english, or science math and gifted programs (we need both, especially here in the southwest where better english would lift more kids up into life-long higher achievement).”  NO child should be allowed into our school system who is not fluent in English.  ANY argument to the contrary is NOT sufficient reason to justify holding back those who are fluent in English, since it handicaps them right from the start and many never catch up.  THIS is probably THE MAJOR reason why our school system is struggling — we have deliberately dumbed it down to the lowest common denominator, and then we whine because our school systems are so poor.  Attempting to create a level playing field at the lowest common denominator level will destroy the future for any child who is forced to hobble along at that level. We are deliberately forcing our children to become mental cripples, all for the sake of some idealistic “multicultural” bullshit.  (5) You state “The backwards anti-science bias and even rewriting of history (less Jefferson in Texas books) that politicians force onto schools, we’re not justanti-evolution and anti-climate science, we’re even anti-metric.”  ALL of these problems would immediately disappear IF we had a strong, uniform system of education.  Needless to say, we must remove religion, or religious-based teaching from the school system.  (6) You state “We had great success with two generations of easier access to higher education: the GI Bill and the middle class wages of the GI Bill adults that schooled the next generation. Now in the face of growing competition, we shoudl be vigorously promoting competition to raise up new inventors, engineers and entrepeneurs, not raising barriers to schooling.”  And we as a nation are doing our level best to make sure that NEVER happens, mainly by refusing to face the reality of what the world has become.",

        "article": "Left-handers have been the subject of curiosity, stigma and even fear over the centuries. Researchers now, however, are recognizing the scientific importance of understanding why people use one hand or the other to write, eat or toss a ball.  Modern lefty lore says left-handers are smarter, more creative and have an advantage over righties. But is it true? WSJ's Christina Tsuei looks into the science of lefties.  Handedness, as the dominance of one hand over the other is called, provides a window into the way our brains are wired, experts say. And it may help shed light on disorders related to brain development, like dyslexia, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, which are more common in left-handed people.  Other recent research suggests that mixed-handedness—using different hands for daily tasks and not having a dominant one—may be even more strongly linked than left-handedness to ADHD and possibly other conditions.  About 10% of people are left-handed, according to expert estimates. Another 1% of the population is mixed-handed. What causes people not to favor their right hand is only partly due to genetics—even identical twins, who have 100% of the same genes, don't always share handedness.  More important, researchers say, are environmental factors—especially stress—in the womb. Babies born to older mothers or at a lower birth weight are more likely to be lefties, for example. And mothers who were exposed to unusually high levels of stress during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to a left-handed child. A review of research, published in 2009 in the journal Neuropsychologia, estimated that about 25% of the variability in handedness is due to genetics.  • Left-handed people make up about 10% of the population, while 1% of the population appear not to be dominant with either hand, known as mixed-handed.  •Being left-handed is only partially genetic.  For reasons not clearly understood, handedness depends mainly on how a baby's brain develops while in the womb.  • On average there is no difference in intelligence between right-and left-handed people. But lefties do better on an element of creativity known as divergent thinking.  •Six of the last 12 U.S. presidents, including Barack Obama and George H. W. Bush, have been lefties.  • Left-handed people earn on average 10% lower salaries than righties, according to a recent study. Findings of some earlier studies on income have been mixed.  •Despite popular misperceptions, lefties aren't more accident prone than right-handed people and don't tend to die at a younger age.  •Left-handedness has been linked to increased risk of certain neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD. Mixed-handedness is even more strongly associated with ADHD.  •Most people's brains have a dominant side. More symmetrical brains of mixed-handed people may explain the link to some neural disorders.  On average there is no significant difference in IQ between righties and lefties, studies show, belying popular perceptions. There is some evidence that lefties are better at divergent thinking, or starting from existing knowledge to develop new concepts, which is considered an element of creativity. And left-handed people have salaries that on average are about 10% lower than righties, according to recent research performed at Harvard University that analyzed large income data bases, although findings of some earlier studies were mixed.  Left-handedness appears to be associated with a greater risk for a number of psychiatric and developmental disorders. While lefties make up about 10% of the overall population, about 20% of people with schizophrenia are lefties, for example. Links between left-handedness and dyslexia, ADHD and some mood disorders have also been reported in research studies.  The reasons for this aren't clear. Scientists speculate it could be related to a concept known as brain lateralization. The brain has two halves. Each performs primarily separate, specialized functions, such as language processing, which mainly takes place in the left hemisphere. There is lots of communication between the hemispheres.  Typically in right-handers, the brain's left side is dominant. But this tendency doesn't hold up with lefties, as scientists previously believed. Some 70% of lefties rely on the left hemisphere for their language centers, a key brain function, says Metten Somers, a psychiatrist and researcher who studies brain lateralization at Utrecht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. This doesn't appear to present problems, scientists say.  The other 30% of lefties appear to exhibit either a right-dominant or distributed pattern, Dr. Somers says. They may be more prone to impaired learning or functioning, and at greater risk for brain disorders, he says.  Hemisphere dominance is typical and more efficient. Symmetry, in which neither side is dominant, is believed linked to disorders, researchers say. People with schizophrenia, for instance, exhibit more symmetrical activation of their brain hemispheres than those without the disorder, studies show.  In a 2008 study, Alina Rodriguez, a psychology professor at Mid Sweden University in Östersund who studies handedness, brain development and ADHD, found that left- or mixed-handedness in children was linked to a greater risk of difficulty with language as well as ADHD symptoms. In another study published last year in Pediatrics, involving nearly 8,000 Finnish children, Dr. Rodriguez found that mixed-handedness rather than left-handedness was linked to ADHD symptoms.  And knowing that a child was mixed-handed and had ADHD symptoms at age 8 helped predict much more accurately than just knowing they had symptoms at that age whether the child would continue to have symptoms at age 16. (What happens when people are forced to switch from writing with their dominant hand to the other isn't well known, experts say.)  Research that suggests that there is a link between favoring the left hand and an increased risk of bipolar disorder and ADHD, among other conditions. Emily Nelson has details on Lunch Break.  One reason that not more is known about lefties is that many studies of how the brain works prohibit left-handers from participating because their brain wiring is known to be different, says Robin Nusslock, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who uses neuroimaging to study mood disorders.  Lefties have an advantage in sports such as tennis, fencing and baseball, when up against a righthanded competitor, but not in noninteractive sports such as gymnastics.  A potential pathway between prenatal stress and brain wiring could be cortisol, the body's main stress hormone, which can interfere with brain development, says Carsten Obel, a professor at the public-health department at Aarhus University in Denmark who has conducted research on the prenatal environment and risk of disease. Cortisol is able to pass over the placenta barrier to influence the baby.  Several studies show that stressful life events, such as the death of a loved one or job loss, during pregnancy increase the risk of having non-right-handed children. In one study of 834 Danish mothers and their 3-year-old children, Dr. Obel and his colleagues found that mothers who reported multiple stressful events during their third trimester of pregnancy and experienced distress were more than three times as likely to have a mixed-handed child, 17% compared with 5%, according to the 2003 paper published in Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology.  Another large study followed 1,700 Swedish mothers and children until the kids were 5 years old. It found that mothers with depressive symptoms or who underwent stressful life events while pregnant were more likely to have left- or mixed-handed children. The work was published by Dr. Rodriguez and her colleagues in 2008 in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.  Experts suggest that left- and mixed-handedness could be used as a risk factor for possible psychiatric or developmental conditions, along with behavioral difficulties, such as having a hard time in school. The presence of such risk factors could prompt early evaluation for those conditions, they say.",

Der Spiegel reports the payments exceeded $10 billion just last year, though the electricity generated made up only about three percent of the total power supply in Germany, in part for lack of sunshine.  Members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's staff are calling the green energy policy a massive money pit and the economics minister says the subsidies are a threat to the economy.  So the government is considering severe cuts to the subsidy program.  Just last month, President Obama mentioned Germany and solar power during his State of the Union address saying the clean energy industry has quote -- \"never been more promising.\"  Politics makes strange bedfellows and that's the case in Indiana.  Democrats and Tea Partiers wanting to unseat incumbent Senator Dick Lugar are attacking the Republican as out of touch with Hoosiers saying he isn't even a resident of the state.  His conservative challenger even held a news conference in front of the Indianapolis home Lugar lists as his official address despite selling that house back in 1977.  Lugar stays in hotels when he travels back to the state. His campaign says the issue was settled years ago when the state attorney general ruled senators don't lose residency while serving out of state.  They also say he pays property taxes on a farm he owns in Indiana.  Finally, a young Saudi blogger has been sent back to his homeland to face trial and possible execution triggered by comments he made on Twitter that were seen as blasphemous against the Prophet Mohammed.

        "article": "American men haven’t won an Olympic weightlifting medal since the 1984 Games, when the sport’s longtime behemoth, the Soviet Union, stayed home.  But a 15-year-old boy in small-town South Carolina is raising hopes for an American weightlifting renaissance. His name is C.J. Cummings, and at the 2015 USA Weightlifting National Championships this month in Dallas, he set a national record. In a sport where athletes typically peak in their mid to late 20s, this teenager lifted more than any American grown-up in his weight class had ever achieved.  “In 37 years of coaching, I’ve never seen anything like this kid,” said Dennis Snethen, coach of the U.S. team at the Beijing Olympics and a former longtime top executive of USA Weightlifting. “He’s the Michael Jordan of weightlifting in America.”  That praise may sound faint, considering America’s lack of stature in the sport: Its last two Olympic medals, awarded to women, came at Sydney 2000.  But as a youth, Cummings is becoming a force on the international stage. At the junior worlds this June in Poland, Cummings competed as a 15-year-old against athletes as old as 20 and finished fourth in the clean and jerk and seventh overall. At the nationals this month, his clean and jerk of 175 kilograms (about 386 pounds) broke not only the American national senior record but also exceeded by two kilograms the international youth record in his weight class (69 kilograms, or about 152 pounds). That record was unofficial, because it didn’t occur at an international meet. But even on an unofficial basis, it tops anything any American weightlifter has accomplished in decades.  No American man competed in Cummings’ weight class at the 2012 London Olympics. Of 18 international men who competed in that weight class in London, four racked up scores below Cummings’s score at the nationals this month of 306 kilograms, a combination of his snatch and clean-and-jerk lifts. But that number falls far below the 332 that won a bronze medal at those Games.  A high-school sophomore in Beaufort, S.C., Cummings lives with his parents, trains an hour or two a day and studies enough to make the honor roll occasionally. When asked if he hopes to travel with the U.S. team to next year’s Rio Olympics, he didn’t hesitate. “Yes, sir,” he said.  The second half of that response pleased his mother, Savasah Cummings, more than the first. “We’ve always told our children that manners will take you farther than money,” she said.  Cummings belongs to a burgeoning force of Olympic-style weightlifters in the U.S. At USA Weightlifting, the sport’s national governing body, membership has jumped to more than 22,000 from only 9,000 in 2012, said Michael Massik, its chief executive. A decade ago, it barely stood at 5,000. “We’re seeing that kind of phenomenal growth in all categories—youth, junior and senior,” Massik said.  In weight rooms across America, a cultural shift is taking place. For a long time, the weight room has been the province of power lifters, not Olympic-style lifters. For power lifters, the measure of an athlete is how much he can bench press—something not included in Olympic competitions.  Olympians execute the snatch and clean and jerk, movements arguably requiring more overall athleticism. During the clean and jerk, for instance, the athlete lifts a barbell off the floor and ultimately overhead, requiring balance and full-body strength, and particularly powerful legs.  The rising popularity of these lifts may be partly attributable to the popularity of CrossFit, which emphasizes Olympic-style lifting. A Brooklyn, N.Y., program called CrossFit Virtuosity offers a class called Olympic Weightlifting. “We place a heavy emphasis on Olympic Weightlifting due to the sport’s unique ability to develop an athlete’s explosive power, control of external objects and mastery of critical motor recruitment patterns,” says the CrossFit Virtuosity website.  Actually, this trend represents a return to an age when Olympic-style lifting was prevalent in American weight rooms. In the history of the modern Olympics, dating to 1896, America ranks third in medals behind China and the Soviet Union/Russia.  Now, American weightlifting leaders are hoping for a return to those glory days. Only three U.S. weightlifters qualified for the London Games, compared with 10 for China. So the first step is for the U.S. team to do well at the IWF World Weightlifting Championship in Houston in November. “We anticipate sending more people to Rio than we did to London,” said USA Weightlifting’s Massik.  It remains to be seen whether Cummings will be one of them. To make the cut, an athlete must be ranked high internationally in his weight class, and to get there the teenager must continue to execute eye-popping lifts, starting with a meet next month in Mexico.  His coach, Rayford Jones, won’t entertain any talk of Cummings ending America’s weightlifting medal drought in Rio. “This is a 15-year-old boy, and we’re going slow and steady,” Jones said. “But you give this boy four years beyond Rio, you talk about the Tokyo Olympics, well, now that’s a real opportunity.”  Write to Kevin Helliker at kevin.helliker@wsj.com",

While none of what I'm about to relay is definitive, it does have the air of something serious, cautious and scientific. Call it pre-sobering, then.  Researchers in China and the United States recently published a study suggesting that so-called Internet addiction—especially where it's occurring by way of online games and for extended periods of time—may lead to serious physical rewiring of the brain's structures.  And here's the unsettling bit: possibly not in a good way.  (PHOTOS: What the World Eats, Part I)  We've heard about \"Internet Addiction Disorder\" or IAD for some time, but it's a controversial subject. Scientists tend to be conflicted about the science behind it, or rather the lack thereof. That's not to say it doesn't exist, just that the methods, scientific definitions and longitudinal studies necessary to view any of this historically remain a work in progress. The underlying question seems to be whether Internet \"overuse\" is simply that—excessive use—or in fact a disorder, something decidedly more serious or \"abnormal\" in the hierarchy of human behavioral problems.  The researchers in the study set out to determine whether excessive Internet use had an effect on the structure of the brain itself, and in particular, to see whether duration of excess use impacted the brain in a quantifiable physical sense. Selecting 18 college-age students who met the self-assessment criteria for IAD (as defined by psychiatrist Kimberly Young in 1998), the research team focused on surface brain matter functionally tied to centers responsible for emotion, memory, motor control, emotion, sensory information, and speech.  The result: \"white matter\" as well as \"gray matter\" reduction in several areas by as much as 20%. Correlating that with similar matter shrinkage in nonhuman animal studies as well as what's known about white matter's connective properties, the researchers surmised the reduction in human brain matter could lead to impaired inhibition (your ability to control impulses), short-term memory damage, decision-making issues and reduced cognitive control of goal-oriented behavior.  Or then again, it may not be such a bad thing after all, according to Karl Friston, a scientist who helped create the brain imaging technique used in the study (though who wasn't involved in the study itself).  \"The effect is quite extreme, but it's not surprising when you think of the brain as a muscle,\" said Friston, speaking to Scientific American. Friston explains that our brains grow into our early teens, after which a \"pruning\" process begins to improve efficiency, thus he says \"these areas may just be relevant to being a good online gamer, and were optimized for that.\"  Next up? Confirming the results of the study, and no doubt refining the methodology for future ones. And while we're waiting for actionable results, perhaps it's worth invoking the old adage by Roman writer Petronius: \"Moderation in all things, including moderation.\"  MORE: Are Video Game Addictions Becoming a Bigger Problem?",

        "article": "Updated APR 21, 2014 12:13a ET  SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs rode the wide shoulders of Tim Duncan to victory.  The Mavericks were not going to let San Antonio beat them with 3-pointers, and they did not want Tony Parker using the lane as his personal playground. So the veteran Duncan overcame a brief injury scare to score 27 points. The Spurs held Dallas to one field goal in the final seven minutes to rally for a 90-85 win Sunday in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.  The Mavericks also went scoreless for 5 minutes during that stretch, their lone field goal coming with less than a second remaining.  San Antonio won despite going 3 for 17 on 3-pointers and getting only 23 points from its normally potent bench.  \"We got killed on 3s in the first four outings this year,\" Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki said. \"It was no secret; we stayed home a little more on 3-point shooters, but you've got to give them something, and Duncan in there is obviously still solid.\"  Duncan scored nine points on 4-for-5 shooting from the paint in the final quarter to help the Spurs overcome a 10-point deficit.  \"Timmy, he's not going to score 24 a game or anything like that,\" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. \"He's the base from which everything else occurs, whether he's scoring or not. It just gives us a comfort level and a point from which to operate. He plays (defense), rebounds, scores here and there. He just does his job.\"  Parker had 21 points, and Manu Ginobili added 17. Kawhi Leonard had 11 points and 10 rebounds and Tiago Splitter pulled down 11 rebounds for top-seeded San Antonio, which has won 10 straight against Dallas.  Devin Harris scored 19 points for the Mavericks, who nearly pulled off a huge upset.  The Spurs had insisted that what happens in the regular season doesn't matter, and they were proven right for much of the game -- much to the home fans' dismay. Absent were the crisp passing, aggressive defense, bench scoring and 3-point shooting that made for the league's best record.  \"It's always tough to change gears from the regular season to the playoffs when you're preparing for a team and they're preparing for you specifically,\" Duncan said.  San Antonio returned to its winning formula over the final seven minutes, taking an 86-81 lead with a 15-0 run. Splitter tied the game with five minutes remaining, rolling to the basket off a screen for an easy layup off a pass from Parker.  The All-Star point guard then drove the lane for a layup and drained a 13-foot jumper, which he punctuated with a loud scream after Dallas called timeout with 2:45 to go.  \"I was able to push the ball and get some easy baskets,\" Parker said. \"It got our confidence going, so once again defensively, the stops that we made helped us offensively.\"  Dallas had taken an 81-71 lead when Brandan Wright completed a three-point play with 7:45 remaining. The Mavericks proceeded to miss their next 12 shots and committed three turnovers.  \"Defensively, we started making stops,\" Ginobili said. \"We were at a point where they were getting to the rim. They were making shots and nothing seemed to work for brief periods. There was a point where we were down 10 where we made a couple of steals. We ran, we got fouled, we got a couple of easy buckets, and that changed our mentality.\"  Nowitzki, who finished with 11 points, was 2 for 6 from the field in the final quarter. The veteran forward was closely defended by Splitter.  *By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  \"They're not necessarily unbelievably athletic and long, but they are very smart,\" Nowitzki said. \"What they want to do defensively is take you out of your comfort zone.\"  Duncan, wearing a heavy brace on his left knee, walked off the court gingerly with 3:24 remaining in the third quarter after banging knees with Monta Ellis. He did not get up as he customarily does during a timeout to greet his teammates.  Duncan later left the court, followed closely by trainer Will Sevening and team doctor David Schmidt, returning a minute later limping slightly less, and he played big down the stretch.  \"I knew as soon as I felt it,\" Duncan said. \"My leg just kind of went numb, so I knew it was hopefully just a charley horse. I knew I needed just a couple of minutes just for the feeling to come back and I would be fine.\"  NOTES: Referee Joey Crawford screamed twice at a pair of scoring officials during a timeout, telling them at one point to do their jobs. Crawford, who once ejected Duncan for laughing from the bench during a game against the Mavericks, was booed regularly by the fans.",

But in a further example of the tensions underlying the GOP as a whole and its more isolationist \"tea party\" faction, Paul, the recently elected senator from Kentucky, late last week called for an end to all foreign aid, including to Egypt and  , both key U.S. allies in the Middle East, as a means to shrink the federal budget.  \"When you send foreign aid, you actually send quite a bit to Israel's enemies,\" Paul said in an interview on CNN. \"You have to ask yourself: Are we funding an arms race on both sides?\"  Paul did not specifically address cutting off the billions in aid to Egypt. Israel and Egypt have been strategic partners in the region for decades.  Secretary Clinton on Sunday denied reports that the U.S. was examining suspending military and economic aid to Egypt, which after Israel receives the most U.S. dollars of any nation. Some pro-democracy groups have advocated canceling the aid to put further pressure on Mubarak.  Some Democrats pounced on Paul's words. \"It is shocking that Senator Paul wants our nation to renege on our commitment to a vital ally, which is necessary to assure Israel's continued qualitative military advantage in a dangerous region,\" Rep. Nita Lowey of New York said in a statement. \"It is unclear to me whether Rand Paul speaks for the tea party, the Republican Party, or simply himself.\"  of Florida, who has close ties to the tea party, over the weekend reaffirmed his support for aid to Israel.  But as far as Egypt is concerned, Paul isn't entirely alone in his views. Earlier this month, the Republican Study Committee, the conservative policy arm of the House Republicans, released a budget-slashing blueprint that called for elimination of $250 million in annual U.S. economic aid to the country.  \"Since 1979, United States taxpayers have spent more than $50 billion on foreign aid to Egypt,\" the committee's report said. \"Unfortunately, U.S. foreign aid dollars have not led to an improvement in Egypt's human rights record or to economic liberalization.\"  But the RSC would preserve the more than $1 billion in aid to the Egyptian military, which constitutes the bulk of the U.S. assistance.

        "article": "Experts often say that the Catholic Church’s ban on artificial contraception is among its most ignored teachings. Pope Francis took special care in an unprecedented survey he sent out last fall to bishops worldwide to ask Catholics’ views on the morality of contraception and how ethics comes into their thinking on family size. In a series we launched called The Pope Asks to mark Francis’s 1-year anniversary – Thursday, March 13 – we are sharing these questions with you. We found people are hardly “ignoring” the teachings, but instead have strong feelings and arguments about them. Here are some of the many responses we have received. Most respondents are Catholic.  Pope Francis: What’s the biggest obstacle for you when you think about the church’s opposition to contraception?  “The belief by hierarchy that sex is only for procreation. If they accepted that it also can be an expression of love, a relief from tension, a form of pleasure, and an outlet for natural urges, their position should change. From my experience being raised Catholic, the Church was saddled with certain negative ideas about sexuality that came down from certain early Church Fathers. For example, St. Paul said that celibacy was a preferred state, but, if you can’t restrain your sexual urges, it is best for you to marry. Several of them had very negative attitudes toward women. This legacy has created a view of human sexuality that is highly theoretical and not consonant with the real world,” Peter Hartmann, 69, Pennsylvania.  “The Church is not sensitive to the economic costs that can affect a family due to a pregnancy. My major ‘obstacle’ is that the Church is an all-male established institution with little or no sensitivity to the needs and individual human rights of women. The men who run the institution are so tone deaf they can’t even fathom that,” Patrick Hirigoyen, 62, Saint Paul.  “I find that the ‘one size fits all’ rules are inclined to follow the letter of the law. I would like to see a little more personal concern for families in less than ideal circumstances. General proclamations from above often serve to drive people from any institution, particularly when the people affected have had no input and no explanation,” Cheryl Blake, 63, St. Louis.  “You seriously even need to ask that? AIDS, of course. Second, this Earth cannot feed any more people, health care stinks. We need to slow down,” Laura Parker, 56, Illinois.  “The opposition to contraception is abstinence except in the interest of procreation, which is simply incompatible with how humans act. Sticking to such an archaic and simplistic dogma only hurts the integrity of the Church,” Christopher Siess, 24, New York.  Pope Francis: What would have to happen for society to become more open to people having more children?  “Children are God’s way of saying tomorrow is beautiful. It’s an old cliche but very true. If people’s lives and spirit were truly open to having more children the world would be a better place. Not necessarily because of the children but rather because of the genuine openness to grace and God’s love that the willingness to have children carries with it,” Hazel Philbrook, 67, Oregon.  “This is a complex question. Needless to say we live in a society that elevates money, power and material possessions. One could argue that has to change in order for society to be more open to have more children. For now to have a post-graduate degree, a 100K+ job, houses, and cars, children are seen as an obstacle to those dreams of capitalist America,” Jaime Briceno, 32, Illinois.  “The question is framed to suggest that low population is a problem. I reject the premise. I’d rather focus on how we better care for the children we have, not worrying about creating more of them,” Tom Riendeau, 47, New York.  “Our world has not benefited from treating children like a disease that needs to be cured. We would need to stop obsessing over everything going perfectly, trying to plan everything, and treating people like profit and loss centers,” Matthew Braun, 39, Virginia.  Pope Francis: Do you see any moral differences between various forms of family planning, or contraception?  “To be able to love is to be able to sustain God’s creation with things material and immaterial. Contraception – whether artificial or natural, if used for the sake of birth spacing and family planning, achieves that goal to love,” Lailany Gorospe, 36, home state not included.  “Generally, no. However, abortion as a form of birth control has some differences from others. It is a contradiction to say that sex must only be engaged in when there is the possibility of conception since that is ordained by natural law. However, the Church permits rhythm, which is intended to allow sex without conception (unless the method fails). Furthermore, the Church does not disallow sex in post-menopausal women, infertile couples, or women who have had a hysterectomy for cancer, for example. So, if sex is permissible when conception is not possible, then that cannot be a rational reason to prohibit contraception. The affirmative value of having children must be balanced by the real difficulty of raising a large number of them in non-agrarian societies. Prohibiting contraception has resulted in immense suffering, which seems incompatible with the desires of a loving God,” Hartmann of Pennsyvlania.

Newsweek said its Twitter account, @Newsweek, was hacked by a group calling themselves the “Cyber Caliphate.” The group claimed to be affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS) and has previously hacked @Centcom, the Twitter TWTR account of the United States Central Command, as well as the official Twitter account of Taylor Swift, the Newsweek report said.  The Newsweek account hack lasted for 14 minutes, the magazine said.  Watch more news about hackings from Fortune’s video team:  Hackers posted a threat to Obama and his family and the words “CyberCaliphate” and “Je suis IS,” a reference to Islamic State and the French magazine Charlie Hebdo. The group — which also took responsibility for hacking Pentagon social media accounts last month —tweeted “#CyberCaliphate Bloody Valentine’s Day #MichelleObama! We’re watching you, you girls and your husband!”  It also posted a message intended for the United States in retaliation for its actions in the Muslim world.  “While the U.S. and its satellites are killing our brothers in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, we are destroying your national cyber security system from inside,” it said.  The message contained a list of names under the heading “brave mujahideen.”  The hack comes following news that the U.S. government is creating a new agency to monitor cybersecurity threats, pooling and analyzing information on a spectrum of risks.  The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) will be an “intelligence center that will ‘connect the dots’ between various cyber threats to the nation so that relevant departments and agencies are aware of these threats in as close to real time as possible,” a government official said.

        "article": "(CNN) -- Fragments of humans' ancient relatives are scattered across the globe. Sometimes a tooth or a few bones are all we have to tell us about an entire species closely related to humans that lived thousands or millions of years ago.  So when anyone finds a complete skull of a possible human ancestor, paleoanthropologists rejoice. But with new knowledge comes new controversy over a fossil's place in our species' very fuzzy family tree.  In the eastern European nation of Georgia, a group of researchers has excavated a 1.8 million-year-old skull of an ancient human relative, whose only name right now is Skull 5. They report their findings in the journal Science, and say it belongs to our genus, called Homo.  \"This is most complete early Homo skull ever found in the world,\" said lead study author David Lordkipanidze, researcher at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi.  Skull 5 is the fifth example of a hominid -- a bipedal primate mammal that walked upright -- from this time period found at the site in Dmanisi, Georgia. Stone tools and animal bones have also been recovered from the area.  The variation in physical features among the Dmanisi hominid specimens is comparable to the degree of diversity found in humans today, suggesting that they all belong to one species, Lordkipanidze said.  But \"if you will put separately all these five skulls and five jaws in different places, maybe people will call it as a different species,\" he said.  Now it gets more controversial: Lordkipanidze and colleagues also propose that these individuals are members of a single evolving Homo erectus species, examples of which have been found in Africa and Asia. The similarities between the new skull from Georgia and Homo erectus remains from Java, Indonesia, for example, may mean there was genetic \"continuity across large geographic distances,\" the study said.  What's more, the researchers suggest that the fossil record of what have been considered different Homo species from this time period -- such as Homo ergaster, Homo rudolfensis and Homo habilis -- could actually be variations on a single species, Homo erectus. That defies the current understanding of how early human relatives should be classified.  Because of Skull 5 and the other Dmanisi fossils, scientists are \"rethinking what happened in Africa,\" Lordkipanidze said.  The Dmanisi individuals appear to have long legs and short arms, based on the fossils that have been found, said study co-author Marcia Ponce de Leon, of the Anthropological Institute at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, at a press conference.  The braincase of Skull 5 is 546 cubic centimeters, which is smaller than expected.  The biggest brain case found at Dmanisi is 75% larger than the smallest one, which is consistent with what is observed in modern humans, said study co-author Christoph Zollikofer of the Anthropological Institute in Zurich.  At Dmanisi, researchers believe carnivores and hominids were fighting over animal carcasses. The stone tools appear to have been used in butchering, based on the cut marks on animal bones, Lordkipanidze said. They are comparable to tools that have been found in Africa.  \"It's a real snapshot in time,\" Lordkipanidze said of the Dmanisi site.  Skull 5, excavated in 2005, was matched to a jaw discovered in 2000. The first example of a hominid fossil at Dmanisi was discovered in 1991.  So what species came after Homo erectus in the history of human relatives? Scientists have no idea, Zollikofer said.  \"It would be nice to say this is the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and us, but we simply don't know,\" Zollikofer said.  The Dmanisi fossils are a great find, say anthropology researchers not involved with the excavation. But they're not sold on the idea that this is the same Homo erectus from both Africa and Asia -- or that individual Homo species from this time period are really all one species.  \"The specimen is wonderful and an important contribution to the hominin record in a temporal period where there are woefully too few fossils,\" said Lee Berger, paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, in an e-mail.  But the suggestion that these fossils prove an evolving lineage of Homo erectus in Asia and Africa, Berger said, is \"taking the available evidence too far.\"  Berger led the team that discovered Australopithecus sediba, a possible human ancestor that lived around 2 million years ago in South Africa. He criticized the authors of the new study for not comparing the fossils at Dmanisi to A. sediba or to more recent fossils found in East Africa.  Ancient fossils question human family tree  Lordkipanidze said he and colleagues consider A. sediba to be earlier and more primitive than the Dmanisi hominids, and that there's \"no doubt\" the Georgian fossils belong to the Homo genus.  But the selectivity of fossils compared to them in this study may have artificially biased the results toward the researchers' hypotheses, Berger said.  Ian Tattersall, curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History's anthropology division, said in an e-mail that there's \"no way this extraordinarily important specimen is Homo erectus,\" if the skull fragment discovered in Trinil, Java, Indonesia, defines the features of the Homo erectus group.  The New York museum's Hall of Human Origins takes visitors on a tour through human evolutionary history, showing distinct Homo species reflected in major fossil finds such as Turkana Boy (Homo ergaster) and Peking man (Homo erectus).  The Dmanisi discovery may find a place there too, but it's probably not going to result in relabeling other species, Tattersall said.  \"Right now I certainly wouldn't change the Hall -- except to add the specimen, which really is significant,\" he said.  There is an area of about 50,000 square meters at Dmanisi still to be excavated, so Skull 5 may have even more company.

        "article": "But at the cusp of middle age in the winter of 1991, disappointed by a failed bid for City Council, Mr. Stringer decided to pursue an entirely different path: restaurateur.  In madcap New York fashion, friends signed on, fathers chipped in and a celebrity folk singer lent his name to the enterprise, a Manhattan bar and saloon called the Uptown Local.  But after a year, Mr. Stringerâs maiden voyage into the private sector was in disarray, mired in bankruptcy and an acrimonious dispute with the landlord, records show.  For Mr. Stringer, a Democrat who is now seeking to become the next comptroller, New York Cityâs chief financial officer, it was a humbling education in the vicissitudes of the free market â and an unequivocal sign that the rest of his career might be better spent in public office, where he has climbed the ranks for the past two decades.  âHe was not the most successful businessman,â Robert Ginsberg, one of Mr. Stringerâs three partners in the venture, said.  A two-story dive on a not-quite-gentrified patch of the Upper West Side, Uptown Local was an amiable but chaotic operation, with a dimly lighted barroom and a glowing neon sign in the window. The kitchen served up rib-eye steaks and chicken Marsala beneath black-and-white photographs of Tammany Hall.  Boldface names â by City Hall standards, anyway â made cameos, including Jerrold L. Nadler, David A. Paterson and Ms. Abzug, who occasionally dropped by for a beer. There were cash-bar parties on presidential primary nights and a local campaign consultant performed jazz on weekends.  All that was missing, it seemed, were the patrons.  âIt was quiet, slow,â recalled Jerry Skurnik, a veteran Democratic strategist whose firm co-sponsored events at the restaurant. âIt was a bar that didnât have a lot of people in it.â  In an interview, Mr. Stringer, now the Manhattan borough president, conceded that his youthful ambitions had collided with a total lack of experience.  âI donât think there was a plan involved,â he said with a lopsided grin, acknowledging that, even as a bartender, âI wasnât particularly good at that stuff.â  But sitting a few storefronts away from the barâs old home, he looked back on Uptown Local as an eye-opening experiment in entrepreneurism.  âAs somebody who was immersed in politics since I was a little boy,â Mr. Stringer said, âit was exciting to think about doing something a little different.â  Mr. Stringer and his partners, friends from the local political scene, envisioned a sophisticated spot in a neighborhood â the West 90s â then on the verge of an upswing. But their day jobs quickly proved distracting.  âWe were always busy with other things,â recalled Alan Handell, a partner who designed petition ballots for municipal campaigns. âWe didnât have time to focus on being at the restaurant very often.â  Seeking publicity, the proprietors arranged for a friend, Peter Yarrow, of the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, to stop by and draw a crowd. The bar apparently left little impression; reached by telephone, Mr. Yarrow said he had no recollection of the place.  The food was not especially memorable either, guests said.  âIt was nothing to brag about,â Mr. Ginsberg, the largest shareholder in the restaurant, said.  Mr. Stringer shrugged off the middling reviews. âI ate there; I liked it,â he said flatly, adding, âThe chicken was good.â  Despite an occasional busy weekend, the restaurant was struggling to find its niche. (It did not help that the partners ate many of their meals there free, according to Mr. Handell.) By January 1992, the owners could barely make their rent.  The landlord, claiming tens of thousands of dollars in missed payments, filed a lawsuit in city housing court. A payment plan was worked out, but Mr. Stringer and his partners failed to meet that deadline, too. Fed up, the landlord, Johny Melohn, moved to oust Uptown Local in June, but days before the eviction date, the partners declared bankruptcy.",

        "article": "A 38-story tower rising on a busy block in Midtown is being billed as the first condominium project in Manhattan developed entirely by a company from China.  Euro Properties, based in Hong Kong, recently unveiled 118 East 59th Street, a 29-unit high-rise between Park and Lexington Avenues. In recent years, Chinese companies have flocked to build in New York, but typically partnered with local firms, and in those rare cases where they have flown solo, it has been in the outside boroughs.  While 118 East 59th Street may be a pioneer, brokers say its developers still have to convince buyers that its location, wedged between office towers, can fetch the same gold-plated prices as nearby Billionaires’ Row.  “It’s a location that’s in transition,” said Tamir Shemesh, an associate broker with the Corcoran Group who is marketing a new 22-unit condo at 337 East 62nd Street. “But the towers that are coming up could change a very commercial area.”  Designed by SCDA Architects of Singapore, whose principal is Soo K. Chan, the narrow tower will have a facade that recalls the pressed-down buttons on an old-fashioned tape recorder, with sections that are beveled, at slight angles. Each of the 29 units will occupy at least a full floor, making them feel spacious despite the skinny site, said Neo Que Yau, the chief executive of Euro Properties. Most apartments will be configured with two bedrooms, he said, and about half will have views of Central Park. Units will start at about 1,400 square feet.  Finishes will include marble for kitchens and baths; there will also be bidet-style toilets, the kind that are popular overseas. But while Mr. Yau said that he welcomed foreign buyers, who have taken a shine to the neighborhood in the current boom, he would not market to them specifically. “It’s a consideration,” he said, “not the most important factor.”  Demolition of the four-story building that once stood at the site, which Euro Properties bought from the Rudd family for $49 million in 2013 and which once contained a tuxedo-rental company, is complete. Yet the condo, where foundations are scheduled to be poured in June and sales set to begin in September, is a work in progress.  As of early this month, Euro Properties was still hammering out details about building amenities, which will include a fitness center, treatment rooms for massages and a lounge with outdoor gardens, Mr. Yau said.  He said that prices “will be consistent with ultraluxury developments in the area.” The much taller and more perk-laden 432 Park Avenue, from Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group, for example, has averaged about $8,000 a square foot for its units so far, according to data from StreetEasy.com.  The new condo by Euro Properties is not that large by Chinese project standards. Oosten, a 216-unit complex that Xin Development Group International is developing, spreads across a full block in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Likewise, at 100 East 53rd Street, a team that includes the Chinese investors Vanke Holdings and China Cinda Asset Management, alongside Hines and RFR Holding, is creating a 61-story, 94-apartment high-rise next to the Seagram Building. (The project was previously billed as 610 Lexington Avenue.)  Zoning on the site of 118 East 59th allowed a tower of only about 30 stories, according to Mr. Yau, meaning there would have been only a few floors with park views. Yet Euro Properties was ultimately able to climb several floors higher after buying unused development, or “air” rights, from the building next door, at No. 116. That kind of transaction has become fairly common, but the neighbor is hardly ordinary. It is the Argosy Book Store, which has refused to sell its home to developers for decades, even as skyscrapers swallowed up similar buildings around it, according to Naomi Hample, an owner.  But as the Argosy tries to survive in a battered industry, Ms. Hample finally decided that her family-owned store could part with a bit of its property after all, or at least the air above it, which sold for more than $6 million. “It was very fortunate,” she said.  Would there be other upsides, like the condo’s residents dropping by to snap up hardcovers? No, Ms. Hample said.  “The buyer will be a billionaire who will use it for six weeks a year,” she said. “A hotel would have been much better.”",

        "article": "On one level, the new “Masterpiece” series “The Durrells in Corfu” is a bit of location porn. It’s a spectacular trip to the Greek island of Corfu, with sunshine-brightened views of the bluer-than-blue Ionian Sea. It’s set in the 1930s, and the series manages to recapture an undeveloped and pristine place. Really, you could watch the six-episode PBS series with the sound off and still be dazzled by the eye candy. (But then you Anglophiles would miss all those lovely British accents.)  On another level, the series is a rich family portrait of widowed mother Louisa Durrell (Keeley Hawes) and her four idiosyncratic children. Based on the somewhat autobiographical Corfu trilogy by naturalist Gerald Durrell, who’s 11 when the action begins in 1935 England, the drama finds the depressed Louisa deciding to uproot her gang for a big adventure. The Durrells don’t talk much about their late father, but his absence has put them at financial and emotional odds in Bournemouth. He has left a giant hole in the family.  Louisa, lonely and exhausted by her kids, is sneaking gin. Gerald, the youngest, is obsessed with nature to the detriment of his schoolwork; at one point, we see Louisa telling off his teacher for caning her son. Lawrence, the oldest, is indiscreetly sleeping around and struggling to write (he will later become a celebrated author). Sister Margo is pathologically unmotivated. And brother Leslie is obsessed with guns. It’s time for a change.  On yet another level, once “The Durrells in Corfu” goes to Corfu, it’s about culture clash. It’s about what it takes for people from very different worlds to understand one another — and how valuable that kind of barrier-crossing can be. There’s a touch of “A Passage to India” in the story, with sensitivities and misunderstandings between the Durrell family and the Greek locals, including various men with whom the children are secretly setting up Louisa. Occasionally, the show, written by Simon Nye, reduces the Greek characters to little more than quaint locals; but on the whole they are well-developed, including the family’s friend and guide, Spiros (Alexis Georgoulis).  Get The Weekender in your inbox:  The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.  It all holds together nicely, as we watch the Durrells heal and the kids’ identities emerge once they get away from the cold British environment. What were character flaws back home become sweet eccentricities in Corfu. Early in the series, Louisa says, “We can’t just run away from our problems,” but in a way they do just run away, and in a way it does work. They thrive in new ways that are satisfying to observe, even when growing pains flare up. And Louisa, too, flourishes, a process given graceful shape by Hawes.  “The Durrells in Corfu” was a hit in the UK, and it has already been renewed for a second season. It’s not as finely observed as “Downton Abbey,” and its themes aren’t quite as ambitious. It can also be a tad precious. But there’s something pleasing about the way it captures a time of innocence and a family in recovery. If you like this kind of escapist fare — and you know who you are — then I expect you will savor this laidback, elegant entertainment.  MASTERPIECE: THE DURRELLS IN CORFU  Starring: Keeley Hawes, Josh O’Connor, Milo Parker, Daisy Waterstone, Callum Woodhouse, Alexis Georgoulis, Yorgos Karamihos, Leslie Caron.

Photograph: Song family  For Wang Le, it's glimpsing the clock at noon; the time when he would ring his mum for a chat. For Dai Shuqin, it's the battered black bag that her sister gave her years ago, which she now carries everywhere and hugs as though it were a child. For Jiang Hui, it's remembering the little gifts his mother used to bring for her grandchild.  \"She was a very ordinary person. She didn't have many achievements. But as a mother, she was extraordinary,\" he said.  \"It's something money can't buy. A toy, a piece of candy – it's a feeling of family love. It is irreplaceable. I really regret that I didn't treasure this before.\"  Six months after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished on 8 March, the relatives of those on board are struggling with both loss and uncertainty. They know they must continue earning money to pay bills, taking care of their families. But Monday's anniversary will be one more blow.  \"You are in emotional limbo. Even though we know it is a 0.001% chance – there's still that 0.001% chance,\" said Sarah Bajc, whose boyfriend Philip Wood was on the flight.  \"I lost one of my children in infancy; my dad died a couple of weeks before Philip went missing. Loss is a hard thing and we miss those people, but in the end, it is a normal part of life.  \"How do you have a memorial service for someone who's missing if there's no proof of death? You can't.\"  Families struggle to imagine how long they may have to go on this way, said Jack Song, 50. He wiped away tears as he explained that his sister should have been on a later flight, but agreed to help out another traveller by swapping tickets.  \"A minute's decision totally changes your whole life,\" he said.  \"It's a miserable story – but there are many, many that are worse.\"  He ticks them off: the wife who lost her husband just a few weeks into their marriage; the parents who have lost their children; the households who have lost their main breadwinner.  Five members of Dai's family are missing: her sister and brother-in-law were returning from a holiday with their daughter, son-in-law and grandchild. When her sister had called her from Malaysia, they spoke only briefly.  \"As you grow older you become gentler in dealing with people, but somehow I felt, because we were very close, that I could show her my true feelings; if I was not happy I'd show it,\" said Dai, 61.  \"I really regret that. I should have cherished our relationship, because you never know what will happen next day. If she comes back, I will really change.\"  Some have gradually come to terms with the idea they will not see their loved ones again.  \"At the beginning, we were hoping for a miracle – that our families are alive and will return safely. Now, most have accepted the fact that our families won't come back. We only hope that the search can yield results as soon as possible,\" said Wang, 27.  Yet for others, like Jiang: \"As time goes by, the feeling that our relatives are still alive gets stronger and stronger.\"  In the chaos of the first few weeks, as conflicting information raised and dashed hopes: \"It felt as if our families had died many times,\" he said.  \"It was the first time in my 41 years that I truly understood the word 'torment'.\"  When Malaysia announced it believed the plane had crashed into the ocean, with all lives lost, families demanded proof.  Now some have become convinced its absence is a positive sign: if half a year of intensive searching has turned up no wreckage, surely there cannot have been a crash at all, they argue.  They have become acutely sensitive to other people's traumas: \"After MH370, I weep for disasters,\" said Jiang. When Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down they sent a letter of advice and support to relatives; when an earthquake struck southern China they banded together to send cash.  Meanwhile they are struggling to keep businesses running and pay mortgages. Although Malaysia Airlines distributed interim compensation payments of $50,000 in June, many have refused them, unwilling to accept that their relatives are dead, or fearing – despite assurances – that it may jeopardise future payouts.  \"You can't close bank accounts; you can't claim on insurance … I have got heart-wrenching, intellectual trauma – and financial pressures. I'm just so exhausted,\" said Bajc.  Relatives welcomed the extraordinary public attention to the case, saying it gave them confidence that the search for the plane – and for answers to its disappearance – will not be given up lightly.  The problem, said Bajc, is that the interest has brought them no closer to the truth: \"We still don't know anything. And I don't know that we will ever know.\"",

        "article": "The American people are “polarized.” That idea is repeated so often as an explanation for why Washington seems mired in dysfunction and gridlock that no one even stops to question it anymore.  Yes, the system is polarized, in the sense that we have divided government on the federal level, or, as Dan Balz recently noted, in the sense that state governments under an unprecedented degree of one-party control are moving in sharply different directions. But how polarized is public opinion on the issues themselves?  E.J. Dionne’s latest column notes there is majority consensus behind ideas about ”economic justice” and the safety net, but that it’s obscured by the degree to which one party remains captive to a conservative minority that wants to unravel that consensus:  The current debate…persistently exaggerates how divided we are…on core questions involving social justice, we are far more united than our politics permit us to be. A survey released at the end of December by Hart Research, a Democratic polling firm, found that Americans supported extending unemployment insurance by a margin of 55 percent to 34 percent. Several recent surveys, including a Fox News poll, found that about two-thirds of Americans support an increase in the minimum wage. [...]  …most Americans broadly accept the New Deal consensus. We may disagree about this or that regulation or spending program. We may squabble over exactly how our approaches to policy should be updated for a new century. But there is far more agreement among the American people than there is among Washington lobbies, members of Congress or political commentators on the core proposition that government should help us through rough patches and guarantee a certain level of economic fairness…on matters of economic justice, we shouldn’t let a defective political system distract us from what we have in common.  The polling bears this out on other fronts. Majorities support immigration reform with a path to citizenship. While people tell pollsters they don’t like Big Government, they support getting our fiscal house in order through a combination of spending cuts and tax hikes, as Democrats want, and majorities oppose cuts to Social Security or Medicare. Large majorities support federal spending on infrastructure to create jobs. Majorities backed the core ideas in the American Jobs Act, which included spending on road repair and tax credits for job training, paid for by taxes on the rich.  As Jonathan Chait recently observed, there is probably a majority consensus in both houses of Congress for a broad agenda that includes infrastructure repair, immigration reform, and a long term budget deal. But as Chait notes, this is obscured by the House GOP leadership’s refusal to allow votes on things that could win a House majority but are opposed by the right flank of the party. The recent short term budget deal broke this pattern, but it may continue to assert itself on immigration, a big budget compromise with new revenues, and job creation proposals (such as infrastructure spending) that members of both parties might support. Or on gay issues, where the GOP leadership has yet to allow a vote on a measure ending anti-gay workplace discrimination that already passed the Senate, at a time when the culture is shifting in favor of gay rights.  Indeed, the frequent suggestion that the electorate is neatly “polarized” down the middle ignores the degree to which this impression has been exaggerated by an unconventional situation in the House of Representatives. As David Wasserman explained just after the 2012 elections, geographic voting distribution patterns and redistricting has created a GOP lock on the House by cossetting Republicans away in safe districts, where they enjoy the support of “an alternate universe of voters that little resembles the growing diversity of the country.” This may be reinforced by the incentives the conservative entertainment complex offers to Republicans who refuse to accommodate any part of the Obama agenda. Add it up and the stalemate in D.C. in the face of major challenges is at least partly due to this unconventional, unbalanced situation, and may be partly in spite of the state of national opinion, not because of it.  I don’t want to overstate this. On some issues, such as voter I.D. or the Keystone pipeline, the public is on the side of Republicans. On others – like abortion and climate change — public opinion seems inconclusive and divided. Some polls do show real skepticism about government in general.  And then there’s health care: Majorities disapprove of the Affordable Care Act. Here there is genuine polarization, with huge numbers of Republicans and many GOP-leaning independents favoring repeal, while major groups in the Dem coalition remain behind the law. But even this could be partly a cause of partisanship triggered by the health law and its association with its namesake. A recent New York Times poll found individual ideas within the law remain broadly popular, with even Republicans supporting the core goal of providing financial help to extend coverage to those who don’t get it through work. The bulk of the polling suggests people are ambivalent and uncertain about Obamacare, but want to give it a chance to work, and don’t support GOP scorched earth tactics against it. Perhaps there is consensus behind the idea that the health law represents the only set of viable solutions out there — Obamacare is it – and behind a hope that they will work.  In fairness, much of this is probably up in the air. The law’s future remains uncertain. Smart analysts like Ron Brownstein believe the electorate is divided into two coalitions whose visions of government may well be irreconcilable, and that failure of the ACA could tip the middle against activist government.  But pronouncements about the “polarized” electorate as the cause of stalemate seem too simplistic. Political scientist Alan Abramowitz emails me:  “While it is true that the electorate is polarized in some respects, it is important to keep in mind that polarization doesn’t mean the public is evenly divided in its support for both parties’ positions. On many important issues, including raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment benefits, raising taxes on upper income Americans as part of a deficit reduction deal, and increasing spending on education and infrastructure, substantial majorities of voters, including large numbers of Republicans, support the Democratic agenda. The gridlock in Congress is largely the result of polarization that is asymmetric.”  We need more good political science getting to the bottom of what’s really causing all the gridlock and sense that the country is hopelessly polarized.",

And when those people were asked whether the group presented “a serious threat to the existence or survival of the US,” 77 percent agreed; more than two-thirds of them, strongly.  These numbers may be a bit inflated. The poll was conducted a week after ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on the Brussels airport that killed 32 civilians. However, a question asked multiple times by CBS News and the New York Times (and catalogued by the Roper Center) after ISIS’s webcast beheadings of American hostages in 2014 and most recently in June 2016 found between 58 and 78 percent of those asked believed ISIS presented a major threat to U.S. security.  The Democrats decided to gamble that these fears will not prove consequential in the final vote and that a sunnier message will resonate with voters. Accordingly, they devoted their speeches to issues that someone who is convinced the country is in existential peril would consider to be moonbeams: love, empathy, justice, equality, diversity, togetherness, caring, nurturing.  ISIS only occasionally came up. Leon Panetta did note that their candidate had a plan to deal with ISIS, while Joe Biden simply denied the fear by proclaiming, “We don’t scare easily! We never bend! We never bow!”  In her acceptance speech, Hillary Clinton also mentioned that she had a plan—air-striking sanctuaries, furthering intelligence, disrupting the group’s online presence—but she had already sought to dismiss the fear by recycling FDR’s “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Actually, if both that statement and the poll numbers are correct, we have a lot to fear.  Perhaps they felt they had little choice.  One possibility would have been to explain that, however vicious ISIS may be, it scarcely has the ability to present an existential threat to the United States. However, President Barack Obama has been trying to get that point across since early 2015. The polls obviously suggest that the argument, however sound, is not selling well.  Another would have been to point out that the U.S.-supported military campaign against ISIS in the Middle East is actually going quite well—and with scarce American casualties. Indeed, there are strong indications that, two years after proclaiming its caliphate and the start of a glorious new epoch in world history, the group is preparing its supporters for the possibility, even the likelihood, of total territorial collapse.  A problem for the Democrats is that optimistic progress reports could be savagely made to seem to be ridiculous if a single deluded ISIS sycophant goes on a murderous rampage in Peoria.  Eschewing moonbeams for lightning bolts, the Republicans played to the fears—but they did not create them. As stated above, the nation had those fears well before the RNC, and there seems to be little evidence that they are aware of the progress that has been made. And so in speech after speech, the Republicans proclaimed, “Our very existence is threatened!” Such sentiments clearly did animate the convention crowd waving signs that read, “Make America Safe Again.” The polls suggest that it likely found a large responsive audience outside the hall as well.  The choice, then, is between a candidate who seems to know ISIS is a problem and has a plan to deal with it—yet will be much more focused on what the alarmed would consider to be lesser issues—and one who, like three-quarters of the population, sees the threat as dire and immediate and will, in all likelihood, eventually come up with a plan to deal with it.  As one Democratic operative, who asked that the Washington Post not use his name, mused, “I believe love is stronger than hate, but fear wins elections.”",

        "article": "Although no one was ever convicted in the deaths of Andrew and Abby Borden, the popular consensus about who’d done it was evident in a joke making the rounds in Fall River, Mass., where they had lived.  On this day, Aug. 4, in 1892, the Bordens were found dead — “Hacked to Pieces in Their Home,” according to the local newspaper headline — and all eyes turned to their daughter, Lizzie, a “spinster of 32,” per a later TIME assessment, who was home with them. The joke went that, earlier that day, someone asked Lizzie what time it was. “I don’t know,” she said, according to TIME’s retelling, “but I’ll go and ax Father.”  Lizzie was the prime — and really the only — suspect in the double murder, although a jury later acquitted her on the grounds that the evidence against her was mostly circumstantial. The trial became a national sensation nonetheless, eclipsing headlines about the Chicago World’s Fair. Townspeople flooded the courthouse to hear salacious testimony like that of the family’s maid, who said that while Abby Borden lay bleeding to death in an upstairs bedroom, Lizzie could be heard laughing nearby. Then she did a little ironing before — allegedly — chopping up her father.  Even if guilty, she was still not quite the monster of the schoolyard rhyme that tells the tale:  Lizzie Borden took an ax  And gave her mother forty whacks.  And when she saw what she had done,  She gave her father forty-one.  Instead, her attorney explained during the trial, Abby Borden — actually Lizzie’s stepmother — was struck only 18 times with “some sharp and terrible instrument,” while her father was hit a mere 11 times. But the attorney insisted that a crime so brutal must have been the work of “a maniac or a fiend… a lunatic or a devil,” not his ladylike client. Apart from possibly killing her father and stepmother, after all, Lizzie had been known as an upstanding citizen. She’d been a Sunday school teacher and a member of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, which promoted sobriety, abstinence and evangelism.  It hardly mattered whether she’d actually committed the murders, however. (Though there’s lots of evidence that she probably did.) She was convicted — and punished — by the court of public opinion. When she went to church not long after her trial, no one in town would sit next to her. For years after her acquittal, children threw gravel at her windows, pelted her house with rotten eggs, and rang her doorbell in the middle of the night, per the Providence Journal.  By the time she died, at 66, Lizzie was alienated from her former friends and the surviving members of her family. The flood of people who had attended her trial dwindled to a trickle at her funeral. (She was buried in Fall River, next to her father and stepmother.)  But her infamy still hasn’t abated. Following the premiere, this spring, of a Lifetime miniseries about her life after the murders, graffiti appeared on the Borden family burial monument. It wasn’t the first time — according to the Daily Mail, which noted that her grave site had been vandalized repeatedly in the past — that Lizzie’s memory had been subject to a hatchet job.

The yen has strengthened against U.S. dollar since the Bank of Japan’s July 29 decision to expand monetary easing.  The traditional monetary-policy playbook calls for steps to weaken foreign-exchange values in order to spur domestic inflation and make a nation’s exports more competitive in global markets. Unprecedented stimulus policies from Europe to Asia this year have only sent currencies higher, frustrating efforts to spur economies.  \"Unless the central bank gives some indication that the easing cycle could be extended or protracted over many months, markets tend to trade the end-of-cycle phenomenon,\" John Normand, London-based head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research at JPMorgan, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \"There’s no more downside to interest rates after this last cut and therefore the currency bounces.\" JPMorgan is the world’s second largest currency trader, according to Euromoney magazine.  The kiwi strengthened against all its major peers, climbing 0.7 percent to 72.57 U.S. cents as of 11:23 a.m. in New York. It jumped as much as 1.9 percent to the highest since May 2015. The yen was little changed at 101.33 per dollar.  After saying in his policy statement that a decline in the kiwi “is needed,” RBNZ Chief Graeme Wheeler conceded in a news conference in Wellington that the central bank had “very limited influence” over the exchange rate. He also said that in a “normal” situation, the central bank would probably be raising rates to cool the rampant housing market.  Central banks are acting within different constraints and \"haven’t been able to deliver as much as the market was expecting,” said Andres Jaime, a foreign exchange and rates strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. “What’s different are the constraints they are facing. The BOJ is facing different constraints than the RBNZ.\"  While the RBNZ policy makers may not be cutting rates as deeply as markets expect to keep housing prices under control, the European Central Bank and the BOJ are reaching the limits of the policies they have used so far.  \"Given the tools that they are using right now, which is negative rates and quantitative easing, those tools are reaching their limits,” Jaime said.",

The article also discusses how traditional monetary-policy playbook calls for steps to weaken foreign-exchange values in order to spur domestic inflation and make a nation’s exports more competitive in global markets, but that unprecedented stimulus policies from Europe to Asia this year have only sent currencies higher, frustrating efforts to spur economies.",

        "article": "NEW YORK — When a woman calls Fidelity about her investments there, her questions are likely to be handled a bit differently from those asked by a man.\n\nCustomer service representatives are more likely to chitchat to establish rapport. And they may frame the conversation around her longer-term goals or the important people in her life — perhaps a child with a college savings account, or an elderly parent. The representative may ask more open-ended questions.\n\nWomen will ultimately receive the same guidance that would be offered to similarly situated men — but when appropriate, the representative’s conversational style may differ. Fidelity said its goal was not to patronize women or to wrap its mutual funds and services in frilly pink bows. Instead, it says it wants to connect with different people — including women — about savings and investing in a way that will resonate, based on findings from its internal research and analysis.\n\n\"With men, many want a Reader’s Digest conversation — they want what they came for,\" said Jeanne Thompson, a vice president at Fidelity who was involved in the research. \"However, reps realize that women appreciate hearing what it means for them and want a deeper explanation.\"\n\nFidelity, which provides employer-based retirement accounts for more than 13 million workers, and other retirement plan providers have begun tailoring their messages for specific employees — including women, but also Hispanics, members of specific generations or income groups, or those, say, who may be borrowing significant sums from their 401(k) plans. Other providers are testing ways to nudge workers to save more with just one click.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a big uptick in the number of organizations that are thinking more broadly about financial wellness and understanding it’s not a one-size-fits-all plan that will get results,\" said Betsy Dill, a partner at Mercer, a consulting firm. \"They have to think about how to segment and micro-target their work force at different points along the way.\"\n\nThere are a lot of headlines about how women aren’t as comfortable with money as their male counterparts, but the research is mixed. The financial services industry conducts plenty of self-serving surveys reinforcing stereotypes, but they’re trying to capture women’s business: More women are their household’s primary breadwinner, and they control trillions of dollars.\n\nAnd among women with access to retirement plans? They are doing just fine when compared with their male counterparts, raising questions about whether any special handling is warranted. In fact, some research has found that certain differences in behavior are hinged less to gender and more to socioeconomic status.\n\nSo why the special treatment at Fidelity?\n\n\"A lot of this is in reaction to research around the sentiment and confidence of women,\" Thompson of Fidelity added. \"But a lot of this is because many women are the heads of households and they are the breadwinners.\"",

        "article": "MPW Insider is an online community where the biggest names in business and beyond answer timely career and leadership questions. Today\u2019s answer for:What is the biggest leadership lesson you\u2019ve learned in the past year? is written by Irene Rosenfeld, CEO of Mondelez.\n\nOne of the biggest leadership lessons I\u2019ve learned over the past year is the importance of leading from the front in challenging times. What I mean by that is getting out to the markets, providing employees with context for the changes we\u2019re making and being transparent about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. In times of change, people need to understand the context for the change so they can more fully appreciate why it\u2019s necessary. Change is hard, and so you need to have a clear and powerful vision for others to believe in, and you must communicate that vision constantly and consistently.\n\nBeing transparent has also been critical to our transformation. For example, since last year when we announced our most recent initiatives, we\u2019ve had regular and extensive communications with our colleagues. Of course, this includes regular global updates from me. But with thousands of people in 80 countries speaking many different languages, we must depend on other channels of communication as well. A priority is to equip our leaders with the skills, messages and tools to engage face-to-face with their people, complemented by a steady drumbeat of news updates via intranet stories, social media chats, videos and so on.\n\nIn fact, I brought our top 60 leaders together in Zurich at the end of last year. You can imagine that was a tough decision coming in the midst of our zero-based budgeting process. But I have to tell you, it was worth every penny to get our top leaders together to hear our story, understand where we were going and ask questions. They left our meeting aligned and inspired, and they brought that enthusiasm back to their teams. The key to managing any kind of change is to communicate honestly, frequently and consistently. In times like these, the news isn\u2019t always rosy, but I\u2019ve learned over and over again that silence is far more frightening than bad news.",

        "article": "Mitt Romney’s attack on Donald Trump was concise and well-written and, by calling the front-runner a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" hit all the erogenous zones of the anti-Trumpsters. But in the end, the speech flopped because, like so much else of Romney’s career, the message was muddled.\n\nWhy was the last GOP nominee shredding his most likely successor? If he feels so strongly that Trump must be stopped, why didn’t he endorse another candidate? And why make the unprecedented attack now?\n\nThree questions, one answer: Romney wants back in, but doesn’t have the nerve to come out and say it. So typical, and another example of what so many Republicans like about Trump. As writer and Fox commentator Monica Crowley put it, frustrated GOP voters \"want a street fighter,\" and in Trump, they finally have one.\n\nRomney reminded us Thursday that he is a boardroom fighter. He might have been a very good president, and I don’t regret voting for him four years ago. I only regret that he lost an election he should have won.\n\nHe was an incompetent candidate, believing he was going to win until the last minute, when he realized his polls were all wrong. He stood mute as a biased moderator sided with President Obama on Benghazi in the crucial second debate. His computerized turn-out-the-vote operation crashed on Election Day.\n\nRomney came close to running again this time, but backed out early last year, a decision he surely regrets. \"I would love to be president,\" he told Katie Couric. \"I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch.\"\n\nHe was right then, and he’s still not the right person. Nobody misses him because everybody knows Hillary Clinton would wipe the floor with him.\n\nYet, save for election or death, there is no cure for the presidential bug, so Romney won’t give up his fantasy. But what he hoped would be seen as a principled stand against Trump was, in fact, a disingenuous and selfish act.\n\nHis failure to endorse either Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz is most revealing. Romney’s only hope for stealing the nomination is a brokered GOP convention where nobody has a majority of delegates on the first ballot and he emerges as a compromise. And the only way for that to happen is for both Rubio and Cruz to collect enough delegates so that Trump can’t reach the magic number of 1,237.\n\nIf Romney really wanted to stop Trump now, he would have backed one of the two main rivals and urged the other, as well as John Kasich, to get out. A total consolidation of all others against Trump is the only plausible way to deny him the nomination.\n\nBut even that might spell disaster for the party. With Trump averaging 35 percent support in the first 15 contests, and with his voters the most committed and enthusiastic, any too-clever-by-half maneuvers that take the nomination from Trump could cause a revolt.\n\nSuppose a furious Trump runs as an independent. Or suppose the bulk of his voters sit on their hands on Election Day. Either way, Clinton probably waltzes into the White House.\n\nAny way you slice it, Romney offers no solution to the GOP’s dilemma. The fears that the party cannot win with Trump are legitimate, but they won’t be resolved by an insider deal or turning to a failed retread.\n\nIt’s time that Romney and all the other bent-out-of-shape gentry conservatives face reality. If they don’t have a candidate who can beat Trump fair and square in the primaries, their only other choice is Clinton. And that’s no choice at all.\n\nCheck out all the times Trump has unleashed on Romney:",
